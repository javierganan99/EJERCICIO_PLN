it can be a very complicated thing ,COMMA the ocean .PERIOD 
and we're making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways .PERIOD 
people working in these canneries could barely stay there all day because of the smell ,COMMA but you know what they came out saying ?QUESTIONMARK 
we made the ocean unhappy ;SEMICOLON we made people very unhappy ,COMMA and we made them unhealthy .PERIOD 
we see the base of the food chain ,COMMA the plankton ,COMMA the small things ,COMMA and we see how those animals are food to animals in the middle of the pyramid ,COMMA and on so up this diagram .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA a dolphin ,COMMA mother dolphin ,COMMA any dolphin - there's only one way that a pcb can get out of a dolphin .PERIOD 
and what's that ?QUESTIONMARK 
here's a diagram of the pcb load of dolphins in sarasota bay .PERIOD 
and we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places .PERIOD 
that's a tragedy for those populations ,COMMA but it's also a tragedy for the people eating them because they don't know that that's toxic meat .PERIOD 
these same infections create harmful algal blooms .PERIOD 
i started out showing how much we had distressed the monterey bay ecosystem with pollution and the canning industry and all of the attendant problems .PERIOD 
it's an ocean planet ,COMMA and we think of ourselves as a terrestrial species ,COMMA but the pyramid of life in the ocean and our own lives on land are intricately connected .PERIOD 
it's a huge driver for culture and i think that it's the most underrated force on our behavior .PERIOD 
the people in these studies report feeling so awake during the daytime ,COMMA that they realize they're experiencing true wakefulness for the first time in their lives .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA cut to the modern day .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA we'll do something with it .PERIOD 
puppets always have to try to be alive .PERIOD 
it's their kind of ur-story onstage ,COMMA that desperation to live .PERIOD 
his mother was a puppeteer .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA it took about <NUM> years to discover the bambara bamana puppets of mali in west africa ,COMMA where there's a fabulous tradition of puppetry ,COMMA to learn a renewed ,COMMA or a new ,COMMA respect for this art form .PERIOD 
so we made a model .PERIOD 
and we had a crate built for it .PERIOD 
we were going to test-drive it on the street outside of our house in cape town ,COMMA and it got to midnight and we hadn't done that yet .PERIOD 
a month later ,COMMA we were there in london with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us .PERIOD 
and we went back to cape town and redesigned the horse completely .PERIOD 
and here is our factory in cape town where we make horses .PERIOD 
i'd just like to describe - i won't talk too loud .PERIOD he might get irritated .PERIOD 
the ears are obviously a very important emotional indicator of the horse .PERIOD 
when they point right back ,COMMA the horse is fearful or angry ,COMMA depending upon what's going on in front of him ,COMMA around him .PERIOD 
the hind legs have got the same action .PERIOD 
and mikey also has ,COMMA in his fingers ,COMMA the ability to move the tail from left to right ,COMMA and up and down with the other hand .PERIOD 
and together ,COMMA there's quite a complex possibility of tail expression .PERIOD 
and it's very ,COMMA very simple because all that happens is that the puppeteer breathes with his knees .PERIOD 
but of course ,COMMA it was the cane is light ,COMMA the cane is flexible ,COMMA the cane is durable and the cane is moldable .PERIOD 
and it's driven and propelled forward by new leaders ,COMMA like many of the people here ,COMMA by new tools ,COMMA like the ones we've seen here ,COMMA and by new pressures .PERIOD 
what it tells is the story of how today actually could be as historic as <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA this may surprise you .PERIOD 
now we have wikipedia .PERIOD 
suddenly big things can be done for love .PERIOD 
take a look ,COMMA if you haven't ,COMMA at donorschoose .PERIOD 
the third category is represented by warren buffet ,COMMA which i call aggregated giving .PERIOD 
it's that he challenged another assumption ,COMMA that every giver should have his or her own fund or foundation .PERIOD 
we have got to realize that it is going to take a long time to do these things .PERIOD 
and that's where my imagined future comes in ,COMMA which i am going to call the social singularity .PERIOD 
we can create a future where hope and history rhyme .PERIOD 
that's why i have one last thing i want to show you .PERIOD 
and they were great community leaders .PERIOD 
i keep this photograph close by to me - it's in my office - because i've always felt a mystical connection to these two men ,COMMA both of whom i never knew .PERIOD 
and i want you to imagine that it's <NUM> years from now ,COMMA and your grandchild ,COMMA or great-grandchild ,COMMA or niece or nephew or god-child ,COMMA is looking at this photograph of you .PERIOD 
and what do i mean by that ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most .PERIOD 
what we're actually going to see is that ,COMMA fundamentally ,COMMA people are communicating on a regular basis with five ,COMMA six ,COMMA seven of their most intimate sphere .PERIOD 
he just wants to wish her a good day ,COMMA because that's the start of her day .PERIOD 
they chat to each other every day ,COMMA a few times a day actually .PERIOD 
but it could be in a school ,COMMA it could be an administration ,COMMA it could be a hospital .PERIOD 
if you were not ,COMMA you maybe had to go through an operator .PERIOD 
the phones were there .PERIOD but the expectation was once you moved in there your commitment was fully to the task at hand ,COMMA fully to the people around you .PERIOD 
this only started about <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
they were living on top of the workshops where they were working .PERIOD 
companies blocking access to im or to facebook .PERIOD 
how you get it shouldn't make that much of a difference .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA two dozen men can tear down a mountain in several months ,COMMA and only for about a few years' worth of coal .PERIOD 
now judy and i - i have to say - totally related to each other .PERIOD 
so homegirls and hillbillies we got it together and totally understand that this is what it's all about .PERIOD 
and we know that eco-industrial business ,COMMA these kinds of business models - there's a model in europe called the eco-industrial park ,COMMA where either the waste of one company is the raw material for another ,COMMA or you use recycled materials to make goods that you can actually use and sell .PERIOD 
and in my hometown ,COMMA we actually tried to do one of these in the bronx ,COMMA but our mayor decided what he wanted to see was a jail on that same spot .PERIOD 
this can support seasonal farmers around metro areas who are losing out because they really can't meet the year-round demand for produce .PERIOD 
and imagine a national business model that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure to improve local economic stability .PERIOD 
the recession has us reeling and fearful ,COMMA and there's something in the air these days that is also very empowering .PERIOD 
there goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding .PERIOD 
i started my firm to help communities across the country realize their own potential to improve everything about the quality of life for their people .PERIOD 
hometown security is next on my to-do list .PERIOD 
the first few systems that we created ,COMMA they kind of worked .PERIOD 
so she expresses here what it's like to see someone halfway across the world having taken your idea ,COMMA built upon it and then acknowledging you for contributing .PERIOD 
and he was a clever man .PERIOD he sort of said ,COMMA well ,COMMA that's ok ,COMMA but you've done very well in your math sats .PERIOD 
it's taken at three o'clock in the morning ,COMMA without the permission of the company .PERIOD 
this picture was taken in <NUM> ,COMMA just before the ibm pc was even announced .PERIOD 
and when people tell me ,COMMA who's going to teach the teachers to teach the kids ?QUESTIONMARK 
what he observed was that kids who write computer programs understand things differently ,COMMA and when they debug the programs ,COMMA they come the closest to learning about learning .PERIOD 
this is in the early <NUM> .PERIOD my son ,COMMA dimitri - who's here ,COMMA many of you know dimitri - went to cambodia ,COMMA set up this school that we had built ,COMMA just as the school connected it to the internet .PERIOD 
i can see any head of state ,COMMA any executive i want ,COMMA at any time ,COMMA because i'm not selling laptops .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK i have no shareholders .PERIOD 
if you look at our professional services ,COMMA including search firms ,COMMA including communications ,COMMA including legal services ,COMMA including banking ,COMMA they're all pro bono .PERIOD and it's not to save money .PERIOD 
dual-mode display - that sunlight display's fantastic .PERIOD 
and that was really critical .PERIOD the mesh network ,COMMA it'll become commonplace .PERIOD 
it wasn't just to kind of make it cute ,COMMA because somebody - you know ,COMMA good design is very important .PERIOD 
if you're in a desert ,COMMA they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart .PERIOD 
use your mailing lists .PERIOD people in this room have extraordinary mailing lists .PERIOD 
and the world production today ,COMMA everybody combined ,COMMA making laptops ,COMMA is five million a month .PERIOD so i'm standing here telling you that sometime next year ,COMMA we're going to make <NUM> percent of the world production .PERIOD 
computers sort of came around through games and toys .PERIOD 
and you know ,COMMA the first computer most people had in the house may have been a computer to play pong ,COMMA a little microprocessor embedded ,COMMA and then other games that came after that .PERIOD 
yeah ,COMMA there's <NUM> million of them sold worldwide .PERIOD 
don't worry ,COMMA relax ,COMMA no ,COMMA relax ,COMMA it's a robot ,COMMA it's smart !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
it can withstand a <NUM> shock .PERIOD the robot has local intelligence :COLON it can flip itself over ,COMMA can get itself into communication range ,COMMA can go upstairs by itself ,COMMA et cetera .PERIOD 
we had the robots down at the world trade center late that evening .PERIOD 
so one year ago ,COMMA the us military didn't have these robots .PERIOD 
he sort of does that .PERIOD but i'm going to - chris anderson :COLON i'm just british .PERIOD rb :COLON oh .PERIOD 
okay .PERIOD he's pretty good .PERIOD yeah .PERIOD good ,COMMA good ,COMMA good .PERIOD 
and at different places in that space ,COMMA it expresses - can we have the volume on here ?QUESTIONMARK 
kismet :COLON do you really think so ?QUESTIONMARK do you really think so ?QUESTIONMARK 
voice :COLON look at my smile .PERIOD 
voice :COLON no .PERIOD no .PERIOD you're not to do that .PERIOD no .PERIOD 
we don't know whether he understood or not that the robot - notice the turn-taking .PERIOD 
after all ,COMMA that's certainly what modern molecular biology says about us .PERIOD 
and for those of you that have teenagers ,COMMA you know what that's like .PERIOD 
and i don't think - - i don't think we're going to deliberately build robots that we're uncomfortable with .PERIOD 
and the watchmaker turned around and said ,COMMA god can see it .PERIOD 
but i felt something .PERIOD 
now you probably know the answer to this already .PERIOD 
i remember it clearly .PERIOD 
i thought ,COMMA well what the hell's that about ?QUESTIONMARK 
now i'm not a neuroscientist .PERIOD 
and how much of that reactive side of it is due to what we already know ,COMMA or what we're going to learn ,COMMA about something ?QUESTIONMARK 
and as we assemble these tools ,COMMA from a design point of view ,COMMA i get terribly excited about it ,COMMA because these are things ,COMMA as we've already said ,COMMA they're arriving at the brain ,COMMA it would seem ,COMMA before cognition ,COMMA before we can manipulate them - electrochemical party tricks .PERIOD 
now when talking about beauty you can't get away from the fact that a lot experiments have been done in this way with faces and what have you .PERIOD 
i'm not getting it off the eyebrow .PERIOD 
anais nin and the talmud have told us time and time again that we see things not as they are ,COMMA but as we are .PERIOD 
ahhhh .PERIOD 
but i also know why it's exquisite to me ,COMMA because it's a palimpsest of things .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA if i just go through some of them now - i know about laminar flow when it comes to air-piercing objects ,COMMA and that does it consummately well ,COMMA you can see it can .PERIOD 
why would you do that ?QUESTIONMARK 
beautiful ?QUESTIONMARK maybe lesser .PERIOD 
underneath this ,COMMA like the story of the swan ,COMMA is a million things very difficult to do .PERIOD 
so all hail to that .PERIOD 
the knowledge bubble that sits around the outside ,COMMA the stuff that costs nothing ,COMMA because that knowledge is free - bundle that together and where do we come out ?QUESTIONMARK 
and so i've stopped using words like form ,COMMA and i've stopped using words like function as a designer .PERIOD 
and for the last decade or so ,COMMA it's been quite clear what being an atheist means .PERIOD 
now i think it's too easy .PERIOD 
and what i'd like to inaugurate today is a new way of being an atheist - if you like ,COMMA a new version of atheism we could call atheism <NUM> .PERIOD 
i really like the art of mantegna .PERIOD 
i think there is an alternative .PERIOD 
we have secularized badly ,COMMA i would argue .PERIOD 
you know the kind of thing a commencement address is ,COMMA and graduation ceremonies ,COMMA those lyrical claims that education ,COMMA the process of education - particularly higher education - will make us into nobler and better human beings .PERIOD 
we need data ,COMMA we don't need help .PERIOD 
and so we need guidance and we need didactic learning .PERIOD 
they'd go ,COMMA no ,COMMA no .PERIOD i don't need one of those .PERIOD 
well a sermon wants to change your life and a lecture wants to give you a bit of information .PERIOD 
otherwise our minds are like sieves .PERIOD 
we associate repetition with boredom .PERIOD 
we're just going to run through all the old ones and watch them five times because they're so true .PERIOD 
the other things that religions do is to arrange time .PERIOD 
all the major religions give us calendars .PERIOD 
you won't do that by accident ;SEMICOLON you will do that because you are guided to do that .PERIOD 
in the secular world we think ,COMMA if an idea is important ,COMMA i'll bump into it .PERIOD 
that's very good .PERIOD 
in the secular world ,COMMA you can come through the university system and be a lousy speaker and still have a great career .PERIOD 
what you're saying needs to be backed up by a really convincing way of saying it .PERIOD 
after every convincing point ,COMMA people will go ,COMMA amen ,COMMA amen ,COMMA amen .PERIOD 
at the end of a really rousing paragraph ,COMMA they'll all stand up ,COMMA and they'll go ,COMMA thank you jesus ,COMMA thank you christ ,COMMA thank you savior .PERIOD 
religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two .PERIOD 
we sometimes hear it said that museums are our new cathedrals ,COMMA or our new churches .PERIOD 
art is about two things in all the major faiths .PERIOD 
and if that thing is good ,COMMA there's no problem with it at all .PERIOD 
art should be didactic .PERIOD 
whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff - the therapists ,COMMA the poets - are on their own and they have no power ,COMMA they have no might .PERIOD 
but you left out one aspect of religion that a lot of people might say your agenda could borrow from ,COMMA which is this sense - that's actually probably the most important thing to anyone who's religious - of spiritual experience ,COMMA of some kind of connection with something that's bigger than you are .PERIOD 
is there any room for that experience in atheism <NUM> ?QUESTIONMARK 
i would say that there are many ,COMMA many gaps in secular life and these can be plugged .PERIOD 
and as it happened ,COMMA i read it from midnight to five in the morning in one shot .PERIOD 
this is one of the largest underground labs in the world .PERIOD 
there is another way to search for dark matter ,COMMA which is indirectly .PERIOD 
when a neutrino hits a water molecule it emits a kind of blue light ,COMMA a flash of blue light ,COMMA and by looking for this blue light ,COMMA you can essentially understand something about the neutrino and then ,COMMA indirectly ,COMMA something about the dark matter that might have created this neutrino .PERIOD 
but nonetheless ,COMMA it's an extraordinary piece of engineering .PERIOD 
here's another view of the same .PERIOD 
the reason why you have to build these telescopes in places like the atacama desert is because of the high altitude desert .PERIOD 
and remember ,COMMA all this wiring is being done by people in extreme cold ,COMMA in sub-zero temperatures .PERIOD 
they're wearing about <NUM> kg of clothing and stuff ,COMMA but they have to take their gloves off in order to do that .PERIOD 
anil ananthaswamy :COLON and i'll finally like to leave you with two images .PERIOD 
they're going to learn from whatever it is they have around them .PERIOD 
it is ,COMMA by far and away ,COMMA the largest print library in the world .PERIOD 
then the question is ,COMMA what do you get ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's starting to be a little bit more specified .PERIOD 
but i have to say that there's older technologies that i tend to like .PERIOD 
and it turns out to not be very hard .PERIOD 
you can actually get really good-looking books for on the order of one penny per page ,COMMA sort of the parts cost for doing this .PERIOD 
and so we've tried that ,COMMA and i'll go over that in a moment .PERIOD 
and it's called the espresso book machine ,COMMA and in about <NUM> minutes ,COMMA you can press a button and make a book .PERIOD 
and one of my favorites in this is the $ <NUM> laptop .PERIOD 
if you really care about books ,COMMA you're going to scan them better ,COMMA especially if they're valuable books .PERIOD 
so all in all ,COMMA that's going very well .PERIOD 
and so we're starting up a program to do out-of-print works ,COMMA but loaning them .PERIOD 
but it is within our grasp ,COMMA technologically and law-wise ,COMMA at least for the out of print and out of copyright ,COMMA we suggest ,COMMA to be able to get the whole darn thing online .PERIOD 
it's sort of the biggest tivo box you've ever seen .PERIOD 
it's about a petabyte ,COMMA so far ,COMMA of worldwide television - russian ,COMMA chinese ,COMMA japanese ,COMMA iraqi ,COMMA al jazeera ,COMMA bbc ,COMMA cnn ,COMMA abc ,COMMA cbs ,COMMA nbc - <NUM> hours a day .PERIOD 
so we've got about <NUM> pieces up there .PERIOD 
and actually ,COMMA it's really been pioneered by alexa internet ,COMMA which donates this collection to the internet archive .PERIOD 
if we go and put it in a couple more places ,COMMA i think we'll be in good shape .PERIOD 
you'll eat countless gourmet meals .PERIOD 
not likely .PERIOD 
and this ,COMMA and then this .PERIOD 
day <NUM> ,COMMA day <NUM> ,COMMA day <NUM> .PERIOD 
fungi don't like to rot from bacteria ,COMMA and so our best antibiotics come from fungi .PERIOD 
how is that possible ?QUESTIONMARK 
the tallest plants on earth at that time were less than two feet .PERIOD 
the earth was struck by an asteroid ,COMMA a huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere .PERIOD 
we were involved with several experiments .PERIOD 
there were four piles saturated with diesel and other petroleum waste :COLON one was a control pile ;SEMICOLON one pile was treated with enzymes ;SEMICOLON one pile was treated with bacteria ;SEMICOLON and our pile we inoculated with mushroom mycelium .PERIOD 
the mycelium is producing enzymes - peroxidases - that break carbon-hydrogen bonds .PERIOD 
so i invented burlap sacks ,COMMA bunker spawn - and putting the mycelium - using storm blown debris ,COMMA you can take these burlap sacks and put them downstream from a farm that's producing e. coli ,COMMA or other wastes ,COMMA or a factory with chemical toxins ,COMMA and it leads to habitat restoration .PERIOD 
there's more than a <NUM> million colonies per gram ,COMMA and <NUM> to the third power is around <NUM> .PERIOD 
in <NUM> hours to <NUM> hours ,COMMA these three mushroom species reduced the amount of coliform bacteria <NUM> times .PERIOD 
this is a space-conservative method that uses storm debris - and we can guarantee that we will have storms every year .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this one mushroom ,COMMA in particular ,COMMA has drawn our interest over time .PERIOD 
and a few years ago ,COMMA we received these results .PERIOD 
<NUM> or greater are considered to be very active .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA for the first time ,COMMA i am showing this .PERIOD 
and we're using a natural extract within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i went to the epa homepage ,COMMA and they were recommending studies with metarhizium species of a group of fungi that kill carpenter ants ,COMMA as well as termites .PERIOD 
the life box - you're gon na be getting a dvd of the ted conference - you add soil ,COMMA you add water ,COMMA you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores ,COMMA like of the agarikon mushroom .PERIOD 
the seeds then are mothered by this mycelium .PERIOD 
i've also lived in biosphere <NUM> .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA in <NUM> it was finally time for us to go in and try out this baby .PERIOD 
the day i walked into biosphere <NUM> ,COMMA i was ,COMMA for the first time ,COMMA breathing a completely different atmosphere than everybody else in the world ,COMMA except seven other people .PERIOD 
we were taking their biomass ,COMMA storing them in the basement ,COMMA growing plants ,COMMA going around ,COMMA around ,COMMA around ,COMMA trying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere .PERIOD 
and we had no clue where it was .PERIOD 
and that you literally do that .PERIOD you stop breathing and then you - - take a breath and it wakes you up .PERIOD and it's very irritating .PERIOD 
and i recoiled .PERIOD they stank !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
people stink !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
i had no idea what was in my food ,COMMA where it came from .PERIOD 
and so we sent one onto the mir space station .PERIOD 
shrimp farms are a scourge on the earth ,COMMA frankly ,COMMA from an environmental point of view .PERIOD 
and understand its interactions with the entire earth .PERIOD 
now it may not seem like it ,COMMA but we are .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
what i'd like you to do is ,COMMA just really quickly ,COMMA is just ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA nod to the person on your right ,COMMA and then nod to the person on your left .PERIOD 
and one documentary writer ,COMMA who was here and looked at this two months after i was here ,COMMA described this not as beehives but as a graveyard ,COMMA with these empty white boxes with no bees left in them .PERIOD 
it was called that because a guy in israel first found it ,COMMA and he now regrets profoundly calling it that disease ,COMMA because ,COMMA of course ,COMMA there's the implication .PERIOD 
we needed beeswax for a project we were working on ;SEMICOLON he was so capable ,COMMA he was able to render the nicest block of beeswax i have ever seen from cow dung ,COMMA tin cans and his veil ,COMMA which he used as a screening ,COMMA right in this meadow .PERIOD and so that ingenuity is inspiring .PERIOD 
and we see these families ,COMMA these nomadic families ,COMMA you know ,COMMA father to son ,COMMA father to son ,COMMA and these guys are hurting .PERIOD 
we have bumblebees on the top .PERIOD 
dennis vanengelsdorp :COLON bee .PERIOD okay ,COMMA thanks .PERIOD 
and in fact ,COMMA there is now a red list of pollinators that we're worried have disappeared ,COMMA and on top of that list are a lot of these kleptoparasites ,COMMA but also these bumblebees .PERIOD 
there are other animals that pollinate ,COMMA like bats ,COMMA and bats are in trouble too .PERIOD 
but i'm glad to say that i think we know the cause of all these conditions ,COMMA and that cause is ndd :COLON nature deficit disorder .PERIOD 
and that is ,COMMA make meadows and not lawns .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA not all of us have meadows ,COMMA or lawns that we can convert ,COMMA and so you can always ,COMMA of course ,COMMA grow a meadow in a pot .PERIOD 
and everyone should open a beehive ,COMMA because it is the most amazing ,COMMA incredible thing .PERIOD 
and if we want to cure ourselves of ndd ,COMMA or nature deficit disorder ,COMMA i think this is a great way of doing it .PERIOD 
she googled ,COMMA and she found this world whistling championship in america ,COMMA of course .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA i'm not the only one whistling here .PERIOD 
and i want to first rehearse with you your whistling .PERIOD 
i start it myself .PERIOD 
but there is a much more fundamental mistake in the overall story of the ark that's not reported here .PERIOD 
so now we have god that is going to submerge earth permanently or at least for a very long period ,COMMA and no one is taking care of plants .PERIOD 
why ?QUESTIONMARK 
this is not the common man .PERIOD 
you know very well about professors .PERIOD 
the blue whale ,COMMA the biggest creature that exists on the planet - that is wrong ,COMMA completely wrong .PERIOD 
some of them are much more sophisticated .PERIOD 
many insects have been used by plants as vectors for the transport of the pollination ,COMMA but not just insects ;SEMICOLON even birds ,COMMA reptiles ,COMMA and mammals like bats rats are normally used for the transportation of the pollen .PERIOD 
this is a serious business .PERIOD 
so we studied the root apex and we found that there is a specific region that is here ,COMMA depicted in blue - that is called the transition zone .PERIOD 
now we know that a root apex has just a few hundred cells that show this kind of feature ,COMMA but we know how big the root apparatus of a small plant ,COMMA like a plant of rye .PERIOD 
they work in the same way .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA if you want to fly ,COMMA it's good that you look at birds - to be inspired by birds .PERIOD 
but if you want to explore soils ,COMMA or if you want to colonize new territory ,COMMA to best thing that you can do is to be inspired by plants that are masters in doing this .PERIOD 
it's much more easy to work with plants than with animals .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
she's being filmed with a hidden camera .PERIOD 
so she's noticed the unusual thing ,COMMA but she's gone back to her normal life .PERIOD 
and we've continued to do it every year .PERIOD 
looking at the entire facade - there were <NUM> total windows - and i knew what i had to do .PERIOD 
so then i gave a new hand signal ,COMMA which signaled the next soloist down below in forever <NUM> ,COMMA and he danced .PERIOD 
this is the best buy in new york city .PERIOD 
and it's a very depressing place to be in the morning ,COMMA it's very crowded .PERIOD 
the participants at improv everywhere events have just as much leisure time as any other new yorkers ,COMMA they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way .PERIOD 
and i think that's sort of the point of improv everywhere .PERIOD 
there was no way to predict how far it would spread through water supplies and how bad the situation would get .PERIOD 
it doesn't require any special training .PERIOD 
it's a quite wonderfully designed animal .PERIOD 
they have become domesticated ,COMMA and human beings have been redesigning their religions for thousands of years .PERIOD 
because what i've been doing for the last four years ,COMMA really since the first time you saw me - some of you saw me at ted when i was talking about religion ,COMMA and in the last four years i've been working just about non-stop on this topic .PERIOD 
and you might say it's about the reverse engineering of religions .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA as with the cow ,COMMA there's a mixture of evolutionary design ,COMMA designed by natural selection itself ,COMMA and intelligent design - more or less intelligent design - and redesigned by human beings who are trying to redesign their religions .PERIOD 
it's like a coin flip ;SEMICOLON it doesn't count really .PERIOD 
is it totalitarian to require reading ,COMMA writing and arithmetic ?QUESTIONMARK 
i know many religions are so anxious about preserving the purity of their faith among their children that they are intent on keeping their children ignorant of other faiths .PERIOD 
this picture ,COMMA which i pulled off the web - the fellow on the left is really an important part of this picture .PERIOD 
it wasn't the cleverness of the sheep at all .PERIOD 
if you understand orgel's second rule ,COMMA then you understand why the intelligent design movement is basically a hoax .PERIOD 
again and again biologists are fascinated with the brilliance of what's discovered .PERIOD 
but the process itself is without purpose ,COMMA without foresight ,COMMA without design .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA it's because its brain had been infected with a lancet fluke that was - needed to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow in order to reproduce .PERIOD 
the key to our domination of the planet is culture ,COMMA and the key to culture is religion .PERIOD 
they'd want to know how it originated ,COMMA what it was for and how it perpetuates itself .PERIOD 
in that case ,COMMA a parasite gets into a mouse and it needs to get into the belly of a cat .PERIOD 
but i'm not just talking about islam .PERIOD 
i'm talking also about christianity .PERIOD 
you've all got a copy .PERIOD 
you've just heard the man .PERIOD 
first of all ,COMMA the goal .PERIOD 
the book is clear ,COMMA vivid ,COMMA accessible ,COMMA beautifully formatted .PERIOD 
just enough repetition .PERIOD 
and it would just be insincere of me not to address those problems .PERIOD 
that's worth mentioning .PERIOD 
you could stop reading this book because life would have no purpose or meaning or significance .PERIOD 
but that is just a difference of opinion .PERIOD 
that's not what i'm really worried about .PERIOD 
and here i think ,COMMA wait a minute .PERIOD 
is he endorsing creationism here ?QUESTIONMARK 
your mind can handle <NUM> decisions a second .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA there's a sense which i agree with him ,COMMA except i think it has an evolutionary explanation .PERIOD 
whose truth are we going to listen to ?QUESTIONMARK 
and here's one that does concern me .PERIOD 
and i'd really like to get a response if rick is able to do it .PERIOD 
a very clever little meme .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating .PERIOD 
every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies .PERIOD 
it looks a bit like this .PERIOD

professional hearing protectors are great ;SEMICOLON i use some all the time .PERIOD 
the elizabethans described language as decorated silence .PERIOD 
sound design is the future ,COMMA and i think it's the way we're going to change the way the world sounds .PERIOD 
it's a fantastic antidote to schizophonia ;SEMICOLON to make music and sound in a group of people ,COMMA whichever style you enjoy particularly .PERIOD 
i'm leaving you with a little more birdsong ,COMMA which is very good for you .PERIOD 
we might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background ,COMMA but we haven't yet .PERIOD 
einstein realized that if space were empty ,COMMA if the universe were empty ,COMMA it would be like this picture ,COMMA except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it .PERIOD 
this is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions .PERIOD 
he thought nature would protect us from their formation .PERIOD 
it's actually not massive enough .PERIOD 
it would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn't ,COMMA anymore than light can escape .PERIOD 
space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe .PERIOD 
want to get away from the sound .PERIOD 
now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging - that it chirps up at the end .PERIOD 
there are very industrious experiments being built on earth - one called ligo - which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over four kilometers .PERIOD 
it's everywhere ,COMMA it's all around you ,COMMA and the space is wobbling chaotically .PERIOD 
imagine a billion years ago ,COMMA two black holes collided .PERIOD 
if it was the big bang we were going to pick up ,COMMA it would sound like this .PERIOD 
and if we pick it up ,COMMA it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation ,COMMA of our observable universe .PERIOD 
and our prison system itself is stuck .PERIOD 
funds for education ,COMMA for training and for rehabilitation are declining ,COMMA so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues .PERIOD 
we give science lectures ,COMMA and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures instead of watching television or weightlifting .PERIOD 
we partnered with the nature conservancy for inmates at stafford creek correctional center to grow endangered prairie plants for restoration of relic prairie areas in washington state .PERIOD 
and just recently ,COMMA we've begun to work with those men who are segregated in what we call supermax facilities .PERIOD 
and so what we see ,COMMA i think ,COMMA is that small ,COMMA collective movements of change can perhaps move an entity such as our own prison system in a direction of hope .PERIOD 
it can't afford to doubt the person who tends the child .PERIOD 
that implies a lot of trust .PERIOD 
as the child grows ,COMMA it begins to discover that the person trusted is violating the trust .PERIOD 
you can be compassionate occasionally ,COMMA more moved by empathy than by compassion .PERIOD 
the tennis etiquette is ,COMMA both the players have to come to the net and shake hands .PERIOD 
compassion is not defined in one form .PERIOD 
that means the whole universe ,COMMA known things and unknown things .PERIOD 
there's no choice in this :COLON that only confirms the reality that the wholeness cannot be different from you ,COMMA cannot be minus you .PERIOD 
you express yourself because you have compassion .PERIOD 
there is no shortcut :COLON it is like swimming by swimming .PERIOD 
that's interesting to me .PERIOD 
you fake it and make it .PERIOD 
if you know how to pray ,COMMA pray .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA it has its pluses and minuses .PERIOD 
therefore ,COMMA we don't find the moral ,COMMA emotional ,COMMA psychological and political space to distance ourselves from the reality of social responsibility .PERIOD 
oddly enough ,COMMA an artist such as myself finds herself also in the position of being the voice ,COMMA the speaker of my people ,COMMA even if i have ,COMMA indeed ,COMMA no access to my own country .PERIOD 
we are there to take pride and insist on respect .PERIOD 
i envy sometimes the artists of the west for their freedom of expression .PERIOD 
our people depend on our artists ,COMMA and culture is beyond communication .PERIOD 
i work in morocco ,COMMA in turkey ,COMMA in mexico .PERIOD 
how to tell a political story but an allegorical story .PERIOD 
what was most significant for me was ,COMMA once again ,COMMA the presence of the women .PERIOD 
start differentiating into effector and memory cells .PERIOD 
we have a million students a month using the site ,COMMA watching on the order of <NUM> to <NUM> videos a day .PERIOD 
and then in a response to that same comment - this is on the thread .PERIOD 
but the paradigm here is ,COMMA we'll generate as many questions as you need until you get that concept ,COMMA until you get <NUM> in a row .PERIOD 
in a traditional classroom ,COMMA you have a couple of homework ,COMMA homework ,COMMA lecture ,COMMA homework ,COMMA lecture ,COMMA and then you have a snapshot exam .PERIOD 
but as ridiculous as that sounds ,COMMA that's exactly what's happening in our classrooms right now .PERIOD 
so you can imagine - and this is what we are working on - is from this knowledge map you have logic ,COMMA you have computer programming ,COMMA you have grammar ,COMMA you have genetics ,COMMA all based off of that core of ,COMMA if you know this and that ,COMMA now you're ready for this next concept .PERIOD 
it'll change what happens at the dinner table .PERIOD 
green means the student's already proficient .PERIOD 
and the data gets pretty granular so you can see the exact problems that the student got right or wrong .PERIOD 
and so the same kids that you thought were slow six weeks ago ,COMMA you now would think are gifted .PERIOD 
and i think what you'll see emerging is this notion of a global one-world classroom .PERIOD 
i'm still doing all the videos ,COMMA but we have a rockstar team doing the software .PERIOD 
and they're doing it at the district level .PERIOD 
and they're literally saying ,COMMA hey ,COMMA this is nice ,COMMA but .PERIOD like that focus graph ,COMMA a lot of the teachers said ,COMMA i have a feeling that a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic .PERIOD 
but yeah ,COMMA it's all there .PERIOD 
and seeing with the brain is often called imagination .PERIOD 
so i am going to be talking about hallucinations ,COMMA and a particular sort of visual hallucination which i see among my patients .PERIOD 
animals too .PERIOD 
i see cats and dogs walking towards me .PERIOD 
she said ,COMMA it's got color .PERIOD it's got motion .PERIOD 
i said ,COMMA there is a special form of visual hallucination which may go with deteriorating vision or blindness .PERIOD 
and you have charles bonnet syndrome .PERIOD 
and about <NUM> percent of the visually impaired people get visual hallucinations .PERIOD 
now with the original description in the <NUM> century ,COMMA charles bonnet did not have them .PERIOD 
on one occasion ,COMMA he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe ,COMMA and realized it was himself .PERIOD 
these cartoons would be transparent and would cover half the visual field ,COMMA like a screen .PERIOD 
but what did disturb her was she got very persistent images or hallucinations of faces and as with rosalie ,COMMA the faces were often deformed ,COMMA with very large teeth or very large eyes .PERIOD 
in particular ,COMMA the notion is that if you see things or hear things ,COMMA you're going mad ,COMMA but the psychotic hallucinations are quite different .PERIOD 
and in particular ,COMMA one area of the temporal lobe is called the fusiform gyrus .PERIOD 
and now we know that there are hundreds of other sorts of cells ,COMMA which can be very ,COMMA very specific .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA i've more or less said what i wanted .PERIOD 
but they stop there .PERIOD 
well they don't disturb me any more than my tinnitus ,COMMA which i ignore .PERIOD 
they occasionally interest me ,COMMA and i have many pictures of them in my notebooks .PERIOD 
so it's a little-appreciated fact that most of the animals in our ocean make light .PERIOD 
i've spent most of my career studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence .PERIOD 
i also use it as a tool for visualizing and tracking pollution .PERIOD 
this is the first time it has ever been recorded .PERIOD 
so that light was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate ,COMMA a single-celled alga .PERIOD 
there's a lot of animals that use this trick ,COMMA for example this black dragonfish .PERIOD 
it's got a light organ under its eye .PERIOD 
it's a scream for help ;SEMICOLON it's meant to attract attention .PERIOD 
there's other ways you can defend yourself with light .PERIOD 
this little squid is called the fire shooter because of its ability to do this .PERIOD 
this is a golden coral ,COMMA a bush .PERIOD 
we're talking to something .PERIOD 
but he's persistent .PERIOD 
we need more eyes on the process .PERIOD 
scientists have always created pictures as part of their thinking and discovery process .PERIOD 
in the top left-hand corner ,COMMA you've got this yellow-green area .PERIOD 
and those red molecules are hemoglobin .PERIOD 
and hemoglobin acts as a molecular sponge to soak up the oxygen in your lungs and then carry it to other parts of the body .PERIOD 
and that's how i really began .PERIOD so let's begin .PERIOD 
those are the letters of genetic code ,COMMA the <NUM> genes you've got written in your dna .PERIOD 
but they physically run in opposite directions ,COMMA which creates a number of complications for your living cells ,COMMA as you're about to see ,COMMA most particularly when dna is being copied .PERIOD 
and so what i'm about to show you is an accurate representation of the actual dna replication machine that's occurring right now inside your body ,COMMA at least <NUM> biology .PERIOD 
and it's jiggling and wiggling there because of the surrounding soup of molecules ,COMMA which i've stripped away so you can see something .PERIOD 
but in each one of your cells ,COMMA each strand of dna is about <NUM> to <NUM> million nanometers long .PERIOD 
it is made up of about <NUM> different types of proteins ,COMMA thousands of proteins in total .PERIOD 
that is the signal broadcasting system sending out the stop signal .PERIOD 
this is how you work at the molecular scale .PERIOD 
and we don't know exactly how they did this ,COMMA although they must have solved some collective action problems ;SEMICOLON it only makes sense that you can't hunt mastodons while you're fighting with the other groups .PERIOD 
so that raised a social question that i believe must have driven new social forms .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA we can't know ,COMMA but we can be pretty sure that some form of symbolic communication must have been involved .PERIOD 
we saw scientific revolutions ,COMMA the protestant reformation ,COMMA constitutional democracies possible where they had not been possible before .PERIOD 
i'm going to talk briefly about two of them :COLON the prisoner's dilemma and the tragedy of the commons .PERIOD 
garrett hardin used it to talk about overpopulation in the late <NUM> .PERIOD 
and most recently ,COMMA neurophysiological measures have shown that people who punish cheaters in economic games show activity in the reward centers of their brain .PERIOD 
jim surowiecki briefly mentioned yochai benkler's paper about open source ,COMMA pointing to a new form of production :COLON peer-to-peer production .PERIOD 
toyota ,COMMA instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace ,COMMA treats them as a network and trains them to produce better ,COMMA even though they are also training them to produce better for their competitors .PERIOD 
i don't think we've even begun to discover what the basic principles are ,COMMA but i think we can begin to think about them .PERIOD 
i believe that the payoff would be very big .PERIOD 
what forms of suffering could be alleviated ,COMMA what forms of wealth could be created if we knew a little bit more about cooperation ?QUESTIONMARK 
i don't think that this transdisciplinary discourse is automatically going to happen ;SEMICOLON it's going to require effort .PERIOD 
i'm not going to dive into them either ,COMMA but photosynths are integrated into the map .PERIOD 
so this is something that we're now going to try for the first time ,COMMA live ,COMMA and this is really ,COMMA truly ,COMMA very frightening .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA no .PERIOD the other way .PERIOD 
this is the current - thank you - this is the current time .PERIOD if we scrub the time ,COMMA then we can see how the sky will look at different times ,COMMA and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times ,COMMA different dates :COLON let's move the moon a little higher in the sky ,COMMA maybe change the date .PERIOD 
all right now ,COMMA i've overrun my time ,COMMA so i've got to stop .PERIOD 
sophal ear :COLON so ,COMMA notwithstanding the <NUM> narration ,COMMA on april <NUM> <NUM> we lived in phnom penh .PERIOD 
they were young soldiers ,COMMA typically child soldiers .PERIOD 
so the khmer rouge took us from a place called pursat to kaoh tiev ,COMMA which is across from the border from vietnam .PERIOD 
and we end up in hong ngu on the vietnamese side .PERIOD 
and then onwards to chau doc .PERIOD 
thank you mother .PERIOD 
somebody has to be a witness to what has happened to you .PERIOD 
and one evening ,COMMA i was sitting next to a very nice gentleman in kabul ,COMMA and he asked what i thought would be good in afghanistan .PERIOD 
this was our sign - it's hand-painted ,COMMA and we had <NUM> all over kabul .PERIOD 
we developed a culturally-sensitive psycho-social counseling approach .PERIOD 
and now you are helping me to regain some confidence in the future .PERIOD 
child :COLON there is no difference here between classes ,COMMA nor white or black ,COMMA nor if you have money or not .PERIOD 
simply ,COMMA if you are talented ,COMMA if you have the vocation and the will to be here ,COMMA you get in .PERIOD you share with us and make music .PERIOD 
in its essence ,COMMA the orchestra and the choir are much more than artistic structures .PERIOD 
that's how they build a spirit of solidarity and fraternity among them ,COMMA develop their self-esteem and foster the ethical and aesthetical values related to the music in all its senses .PERIOD 
all this makes up a constructive and ascending social dynamic .PERIOD 
it's what makes a little girl play the clarinet at home ,COMMA while her mother does the housework .PERIOD 
and these will be some simple design qualities and they will also be some qualities of ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA the intelligence of interaction .PERIOD 
now we've put people <NUM> inches in front of a tv ,COMMA and all the artifacts that none of the original designers expected to be seen ,COMMA all of a sudden ,COMMA are staring you in the face :COLON the shadow mask ,COMMA the scan lines ,COMMA all of that .PERIOD 
and my favorite example is always fingers .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA they're not :COLON it's really a very ,COMMA very high-resolution input medium - you have to just do it twice ,COMMA you have to touch the screen and then rotate your finger slightly - and you can move a cursor with great accuracy .PERIOD 
and we have never known how to do this technically ,COMMA so this slide is a fake slide .PERIOD 
ok .PERIOD so there is the pressure-sensitive display in operation .PERIOD 
the person's just ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA pushing on the screen to make a curve .PERIOD 
and what you can do - oops ,COMMA i didn't mean to do that - what you can do is actually feed back to the user the feeling of the physical properties .PERIOD 
what i'll show you very quickly is a new kind of book where it is mixed now with .PERIOD all sorts of things live in there ,COMMA but you have to keep a few things in mind .PERIOD 
so it knows ,COMMA or at least there is computer-readable information in the medium itself .PERIOD it's just not a static movie frame .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA that would be ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA the top green track ,COMMA which doesn't mean too much .PERIOD but you might have to elaborate for me or for somebody who isn't an expert ,COMMA and say ,COMMA cook at <NUM> degrees for <NUM> minutes .PERIOD 
if you're in a classroom situation and somebody asks a question ,COMMA the last thing you do is repeat what you just said .PERIOD 
he says ,COMMA well ,COMMA reading is this junk they give me in little books to read .PERIOD 
and that story has many other anecdotes that are similar ,COMMA but wow .PERIOD the key to the future of computers in education is right there ,COMMA and it is :COLON when does it mean something to a child ?QUESTIONMARK 
what the truth is is that speaking has great value to a child ;SEMICOLON the child can get a great deal by talking to you .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA in senegal we found that this was the traditional classroom :COLON <NUM> kids - three per desk - one teacher ,COMMA a little bit of chalk .PERIOD 
that's what meant something to her ,COMMA is doing the hair pattern ,COMMA and actually did it within two days - an hour each day - and found it was ,COMMA to her ,COMMA absolutely the most meaningful piece .PERIOD 
and my last example - as some of my former colleagues ,COMMA whom i see in the room ,COMMA can imagine what it will be .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA that is sufficiently zany that we would ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA jump to the bait ,COMMA and we did .PERIOD 
so if i ,COMMA all of a sudden ,COMMA turn to the person to my left and start talking to that person ,COMMA then at the person to my right's site ,COMMA he'll see these two plastic heads talking to each other .PERIOD 
and then if that person interrupts ,COMMA then those two heads may turn .PERIOD 
we're testing these kinds of simple sensor-network technologies in the home so that any phone that a senior is already comfortable with can help them deal with their medications .PERIOD 
and as we monitor phone usage by seniors over a long period of time ,COMMA down to the tenths of a microsecond ,COMMA that recognition moment of whether they can figure out that person on the other end is a friend and we start talking to them immediately ,COMMA or they do a lot of what's called trouble talk ,COMMA where they're like ,COMMA wait ,COMMA who is this ?QUESTIONMARK oh .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA sensors are looking at that kind of voice .PERIOD 
if they have a hip fracture we go with them and we study their entire discharge experience .PERIOD 
this is <NUM> tsunamis scheduled on the calendar ,COMMA but somehow we can't sort of marshal our government and innovative forces to sort of get out in front of it and do something about it .PERIOD we'll wait until it's more of a catastrophe ,COMMA and react ,COMMA as opposed to prepare for it .PERIOD 
this mentality of traveling to and timesharing large ,COMMA expensive healthcare systems actually began in <NUM> .PERIOD 
we have to shift from this mainframe mentality of healthcare to a personal model of healthcare .PERIOD 
how do we collect not just biological data but behavioral data ,COMMA psychological data ,COMMA relational data ,COMMA in and on and around the home ?QUESTIONMARK 
they fixed her back up .PERIOD she was never going to be able to move back into the assisted living .PERIOD they put her into the nursing home unit .PERIOD 
i'm not bragging about how much we fund ;SEMICOLON it's how little anyone else actually pays attention to aging and funds innovation on aging ,COMMA chronic disease management and independent living in the home .PERIOD 
and so that's what i've been striving for all of my life .PERIOD 
but instead ,COMMA i go out and i find things .PERIOD 
then i just pick things up .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA at that time ,COMMA i was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues .PERIOD 
the appearance of them would have been different - which it is in all social animals .PERIOD 
in social groups of animals ,COMMA the juveniles always look different than the adults .PERIOD 
and probably a whole bunch of trees as well .PERIOD 
now it wasn't dna ;SEMICOLON she didn't find dna .PERIOD 
we gave samples to mary schweitzer ,COMMA and she was actually able to determine that b-rex was a female based on medullary tissue found on the inside of the bone .PERIOD 
and so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18-wheeler trailer ,COMMA and actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA it was wonderful stuff .PERIOD 
so that's what i'm here to tell you about :COLON how we are going to fix a chicken .PERIOD 
we started out with a wolf-like creature and we ended up with a maltese .PERIOD 
and so that's what we're looking into .PERIOD 
archaeopteryx ,COMMA which is a bird ,COMMA a primitive bird ,COMMA still has that very primitive hand .PERIOD 
it has the three fingers ,COMMA the three digits .PERIOD 
birds have basically rudimentary tails .PERIOD 
but a gene turns on and resorbs the tail ,COMMA gets rid of it .PERIOD 
and people always say ,COMMA why do that ?QUESTIONMARK 
what the frigoris you doing ?QUESTIONMARK names are important .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA frank is this clear to you ,COMMA djabran fluctus ?QUESTIONMARK 
listen ,COMMA i'm going back to the swamp mermaid .PERIOD can you call me in a little while ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA these are actual names of people that work there .PERIOD 
i did some more investigation .PERIOD 
there are some mapping people who do use their names .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA formulas relate number to form .PERIOD 
they got little babies in there ,COMMA floating in there .PERIOD 
it's a different kind of course .PERIOD and they've got five apples ?QUESTIONMARK 
because that's why we're here ,COMMA really ,COMMA i think to figure stuff out and to love each other .PERIOD 
they are so different .PERIOD 
bode's law wasn't even his law .PERIOD it was a guy named titus .PERIOD 
just a correlation that indicates how things are misinterpreted .PERIOD 
golden section ,COMMA i've been obsessed with this thing since before i was born .PERIOD 
i know that scares a lot of you ,COMMA but that was my purpose entirely .PERIOD 
if fibonacci had been on paxil ,COMMA that would be the fibonacci series .PERIOD 
yes ,COMMA mama .PERIOD 
there is so many intricate relationships that i'm not going to go there now ,COMMA because you would say ,COMMA hey ,COMMA go back to the fluctus part .PERIOD 
and i'm presenting it here at ted .PERIOD why ?QUESTIONMARK 
it just seems like it's not sexy and elegant ,COMMA it's hidden .PERIOD 
and look at this ,COMMA built within it is the golden ratio .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
good afternoon .PERIOD 
in <NUM> ,COMMA in the middle of the cold war in soviet siberia ,COMMA a pipeline exploded with a burst of <NUM> kilotons ,COMMA the equivalent of a fourth of the hiroshima bomb .PERIOD 
and with these keys ,COMMA they may have been able to get inside centcom's systems ,COMMA to see and hear everything ,COMMA and maybe even infect some of them .PERIOD 
as a result ,COMMA the americans take the threat very seriously .PERIOD 
i'll quote general james cartwright ,COMMA vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff ,COMMA who says in a report to congress that cyberattacks could be as powerful as weapons of mass destruction .PERIOD 
moreover ,COMMA the americans have decided to spend over <NUM> billion dollars in the next five years to build up their cyberwar capabilities .PERIOD 
cyber weapons have this peculiar feature :COLON they can be used without leaving traces .PERIOD 
cartoons are basically short stories .PERIOD 
and that prompted people to make maps like this ,COMMA with all kinds of wonderful detail on the land ,COMMA but when you get to the waters edge ,COMMA the ocean looks like one giant puddle of blue paint .PERIOD 
and best of all ,COMMA i saw the animals .PERIOD 
could you image if we looked through the hubble telescope and we saw that ?QUESTIONMARK 
it would start a whole new space race .PERIOD 
for instance ,COMMA take these sea turtles .PERIOD 
they kind of have a sixth sense like superman's x-ray vision .PERIOD 
they can sense the magnetic fields of the earth .PERIOD 
or take this sea cucumber .PERIOD 
he's sort of a homer simpson with fins .PERIOD 
he goes down and he meets this famous anglerfish .PERIOD 
the third storyline i did about a year and a half ago was probably my most difficult .PERIOD 
i do three or four strips after that where we explore the finning issue and the shark fin soup issue .PERIOD 
there was a real website based in china that actually sold shark fins ,COMMA so i kind of exposed that .PERIOD 
and you see you have a beautiful piece of white alabaster .PERIOD 
so you say to yourself ,COMMA well ,COMMA that's worth something .PERIOD 
so you go back into the room ,COMMA and you break this thing to pieces ,COMMA and you haul it away .PERIOD 
thanks for listening .PERIOD 
audience :COLON <NUM> .PERIOD 
audience :COLON <NUM> .PERIOD 
woman :COLON no .PERIOD 
<NUM> .PERIOD let's give three of them a nice round of applause there .PERIOD 
what i'm going to try and do then - i notice that took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer .PERIOD 
audience :COLON <NUM> .PERIOD 
audience :COLON <NUM> .PERIOD 
<NUM> ?QUESTIONMARK 
eight-digit capacity - don't you hate that ?QUESTIONMARK 
in the meanwhile ,COMMA let me conclude the first part of my show by doing something a little trickier .PERIOD 
really scramble them up this time ,COMMA please .PERIOD 
for my next number - while i mentally recharge my batteries ,COMMA i have one more question for the audience .PERIOD 
let's see ,COMMA starting with - let's start with a gentleman first ,COMMA ok sir ,COMMA what year was it ,COMMA first of all ?QUESTIONMARK that's why i start with a gentleman first .PERIOD 
yell it out ,COMMA what year ?QUESTIONMARK audience :COLON <NUM> .PERIOD 
<NUM> ,COMMA ok - and the month ?QUESTIONMARK 
audience :COLON may .PERIOD ab :COLON may what ?QUESTIONMARK 
it was .PERIOD ab :COLON and it was cloudy .PERIOD 
<NUM> squared .PERIOD yuck .PERIOD 
i'm going to break the problem down into three parts .PERIOD 
i'll do <NUM> squared ,COMMA plus <NUM> squared ,COMMA plus <NUM> times <NUM> times two .PERIOD 
while i explain something else - - i know ,COMMA that you can use ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
that seems right ,COMMA i'll go on .PERIOD cookie fission ,COMMA ok .PERIOD 
a third time ,COMMA it's just being a technician .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i'm not going to talk about that .PERIOD 
get them out of schools ,COMMA and keep them out of schools .PERIOD 
having said that ,COMMA i outlined my talk about five minutes ago .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA if you want to know what society's going to be like in <NUM> years ,COMMA ask a kindergarten teacher .PERIOD 
but to me ,COMMA things aren't the future .PERIOD 
right away ,COMMA i hope that all of your eyes glaze over .PERIOD 
this is a klein bottle .PERIOD 
it's one sided .PERIOD it's a bottle whose inside is its outside .PERIOD 
it has zero volume .PERIOD and it's non-orientable .PERIOD 
it has wonderful properties .PERIOD 
that was a month of my life .PERIOD 
oh ,COMMA cool .PERIOD i can get to this place over here ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
i take lunch hour .PERIOD 
one of the things that i've done for my science students is to tell them ,COMMA look ,COMMA i'm going to teach you college-level physics .PERIOD 
is a constant .PERIOD when the frequency goes up ,COMMA the wavelength comes down .PERIOD wavelength goes up ,COMMA frequency goes down .PERIOD so ,COMMA if we have a wave here - over here ,COMMA that's what's interesting - as the pitch goes up ,COMMA things get closer ,COMMA pitch goes down ,COMMA things stretch out .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA so i know the frequency .PERIOD 
those of you who are physicists ,COMMA i hear you rolling your eyes ,COMMA but bear with me .PERIOD 
it's one of these bell-tower buildings .PERIOD 
i keep climbing up ,COMMA go back .PERIOD 
a dome ,COMMA one of these ten-foot domes .PERIOD 
in this light ,COMMA may science and religion endeavor here for the steady evolution of mankind ,COMMA from darkness to light ,COMMA from narrowness to broad-mindedness ,COMMA from prejudice to tolerance .PERIOD 
it's time for me to let it go .PERIOD 
we want space efficiency .PERIOD 
finally ,COMMA we want multifunctional spaces and housewares - a sink combined with a toilet ,COMMA a dining table becomes a bed - same space ,COMMA a little side table stretches out to seat <NUM> .PERIOD 
guests ?QUESTIONMARK move the moving wall ,COMMA have some fold-down guest beds .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
seriously ,COMMA but dangerously fun .PERIOD 
and there it is .PERIOD and i think this is a typical picture of what it was like in a courtyard then .PERIOD 
so i'm gon na take you through what i think is a remarkable sequence .PERIOD 
any of you who've been to africa or had a junkyard dog come after you ,COMMA there is a fixed kind of predatory gaze that you know you're in trouble .PERIOD 
and this polar bear stands over the husky ,COMMA no claws extended ,COMMA no fangs taking a look .PERIOD 
and it's that state that allows these two creatures to explore the possible .PERIOD 
they are beginning to do something that neither would have done without the play signals .PERIOD 
and it is a marvelous example of how a differential in power can be overridden by a process of nature that's within all of us .PERIOD 
john mentioned that i've done some work with murderers ,COMMA and i have .PERIOD 
if you're having a bad day ,COMMA try this :COLON jump up and down ,COMMA wiggle around - you're going to feel better .PERIOD 
but it has to be safe exploration .PERIOD 
but if you look closely ,COMMA they're kind of like the polar bear and husky :COLON no claws ,COMMA flat fur ,COMMA soft eyes ,COMMA open mouth with no fangs ,COMMA balletic movements ,COMMA curvilinear movements - all specific to play .PERIOD 
we all have an internal narrative that's our own inner story .PERIOD 
we don't know a whole lot about what it does for the human brain ,COMMA because funding has not been exactly heavy for research on play .PERIOD 
i think that - that's a few years back - i think that wave is past ,COMMA and the play wave is cresting ,COMMA because there is some good science .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the program says that the opposite of play is not work ,COMMA it's depression .PERIOD 
nobody misses that dog i took a picture of on a carmel beach a couple of weeks ago .PERIOD 
you may not know this word ,COMMA but it should be your biological first name and last name .PERIOD 
found that when he looked at a playground out of a window into which he had been confined ,COMMA he felt something different .PERIOD 
and looking at his history ,COMMA which is common in the press ,COMMA it seems to me ,COMMA at least - looking at it from a shrink's point of view - that a lot of his life was programmed .PERIOD 
he had the expectations of his senatorial father and washington ,COMMA d.c .PERIOD 
most of us work with groups ,COMMA and i put this up because the d.school ,COMMA the design school at stanford ,COMMA thanks to david kelley and a lot of others who have been visionary about its establishment ,COMMA has allowed a group of us to get together and create a course called from play to innovation .PERIOD 
so what will follow is a student-made film about just that .PERIOD 
but it doesn't have to be that way .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
if you stop a cat from playing - which you can do ,COMMA and we've all seen how cats bat around stuff - they're just as good predators as they would be if they hadn't played .PERIOD 
and if you look at sleep and dreams biologically ,COMMA animals sleep and dream ,COMMA and they rehearse and they do some other things that help memory and that are a very important part of sleep and dreams .PERIOD 
the next step of evolution in mammals and creatures with divinely superfluous neurons will be to play .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA i think the only way i know to do it is to have accumulated the advisers that i have who go from practitioners - who can establish through improvisational play or clowning or whatever - a state of play .PERIOD 
unfortunately ,COMMA that hasn't been done sufficiently for the national science foundation ,COMMA national institute of mental health or anybody else to really look at it in this way seriously .PERIOD 
so our diners started to get bored with this idea ,COMMA and we decided to give them the same course twice ,COMMA so here we actually took an element from the maki roll and and took a picture of a dish and then basically served that picture with the dish .PERIOD 
it's a glycoprotein called miraculin ,COMMA a naturally occurring thing .PERIOD it still freaks me out every time i eat it ,COMMA but it has a unique ability to mask certain taste receptors on your tongue ,COMMA so that primarily sour taste receptors ,COMMA so normally things that would taste very sour or tart ,COMMA somehow begin to taste very sweet .PERIOD 
as long as it's good for you and good for the environment ,COMMA it doesn't matter .PERIOD 
aside from one-person abc mini-bureaus in nairobi ,COMMA new delhi and mumbai ,COMMA there are no network news bureaus in all of africa ,COMMA india or south america - places that are home to more than two billion people .PERIOD 
and can we afford not to ?QUESTIONMARK thank you .PERIOD 
at this time ,COMMA there were thousands of individuals ,COMMA we think ,COMMA that were infected with hiv .PERIOD 
ok now ,COMMA more importantly ,COMMA had we been there in the <NUM> and <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA had we seen this disease ,COMMA had we understood exactly what was going on with it ,COMMA how might that have changed and completely transformed the nature of the way this pandemic moved ?QUESTIONMARK 
nevertheless ,COMMA we spend the vast majority of our energy focused on this level of the pyramid ,COMMA trying to tackle things that are already completely adapted to human beings ,COMMA that are going to be very very difficult to address - as we've seen in the case of hiv .PERIOD 
so during the last <NUM> years ,COMMA i've been working to actually study the earlier interface here - what i've labeled viral chatter ,COMMA which was a term coined by my mentor don burke .PERIOD 
narrator :COLON deep in a remote region of cameroon ,COMMA two hunters stalk their prey .PERIOD 
a group of hunters approach ,COMMA their packs loaded with wild game .PERIOD 
this is challenging work to do .PERIOD 
but - when he began to speak they would actually recognize his voice from the radio .PERIOD 
so what happened ?QUESTIONMARK so during the <NUM> years that we've been doing this work ,COMMA we actually surprised ourselves .PERIOD 
we made a number of discoveries .PERIOD 
it's something we should be following .PERIOD it's not something that we should be surprised by .PERIOD 
so it's not just hunters in central africa .PERIOD 
and somehow the idea that one would want to make art for the iphone ,COMMA which my friends and i are doing now ,COMMA is still not reflected in our understanding of what computers are for .PERIOD 
if you look carefully ,COMMA you can even see a hint of the apple menu ,COMMA up here in the upper left ,COMMA where the virtual world has literally punched through to the physical .PERIOD 
because this is ,COMMA in some sense ,COMMA the first way ,COMMA that people discover their own potential as actors ,COMMA and discover their own agency .PERIOD 
by saying who is that person in the mirror ?QUESTIONMARK oh it's actually me .PERIOD 
song is one of our oldest ways of making ourselves heard and understood .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA whereas dr. oliver sacks has talked about how perhaps one person in a million actually has true synesthesia ,COMMA where they hear colors or taste shapes ,COMMA and things like this ,COMMA phonaesthesia is something we can all experience to some extent .PERIOD 
so the idea is you step into a kind of a magic light .PERIOD 
you know ?QUESTIONMARK they don't imagine the person in the booth ,COMMA typing it all .PERIOD 
and it's one of the most interesting technical challenges that's very currently active in the computer sciences :COLON being able to have a camera that can understand ,COMMA from a fairly big distance away ,COMMA how these little tiny balls are actually pointing in one way or another to reveal what you're interested in ,COMMA and where your attention is directed .PERIOD 
and so i've been beginning ,COMMA with a variety of different projects ,COMMA to understand how people can relate to machines with their eyes .PERIOD 
in the first one which i'm going to show you ,COMMA called eyecode ,COMMA it's a piece of interactive software in which ,COMMA if we read this little circle ,COMMA the trace left by the looking of the previous observer looks at the trace left by the looking of previous observer .PERIOD 
but if i come up really close and stare directly at the camera on this laptop then you'll see these nice crisp eyes .PERIOD 
and what you're typing are recordings of your eyes as you're looking at other peoples' eyes .PERIOD 
and this exists in larger installations where there are thousands and thousands of eyes that people could be staring at ,COMMA as you see who's looking at the people looking at the people looking before them .PERIOD 
checking him out .PERIOD 
you say what you're doing in <NUM> characters or less ,COMMA and people who are interested in you get those updates .PERIOD 
it is by sharing these moments as they're happening that lets people feel more connected and in touch ,COMMA despite distance ,COMMA and in real time .PERIOD 
one of my favorites is what happened a few months ago when there was a gas shortage in atlanta .PERIOD 
it's happened more and more lately ,COMMA whether it's raising money for homeless people or to dig wells in africa or for a family in crisis .PERIOD 
evan williams :COLON nice .PERIOD thanks .PERIOD 
and i would like to tell you a few personal stories about what i like to call the danger of the single story .PERIOD 
my characters also drank a lot of ginger beer because the characters in the british books i read drank ginger beer .PERIOD 
i realized that people like me ,COMMA girls with skin the color of chocolate ,COMMA whose kinky hair could not form ponytails ,COMMA could also exist in literature .PERIOD 
but the unintended consequence was that i did not know that people like me could exist in literature .PERIOD 
so what the discovery of african writers did for me was this :COLON it saved me from having a single story of what books are .PERIOD 
so i felt enormous pity for fide's family .PERIOD 
if i had not grown up in nigeria ,COMMA and if all i knew about africa were from popular images ,COMMA i too would think that africa was a place of beautiful landscapes ,COMMA beautiful animals ,COMMA and incomprehensible people ,COMMA fighting senseless wars ,COMMA dying of poverty and aids ,COMMA unable to speak for themselves and waiting to be saved by a kind ,COMMA white foreigner .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i've laughed every time i've read this .PERIOD 
so that is how to create a single story ,COMMA show a people as one thing ,COMMA as only one thing ,COMMA over and over again ,COMMA and that is what they become .PERIOD 
my cousin polle died because he could not get adequate healthcare .PERIOD 
what the nigerian writer chinua achebe calls a balance of stories .PERIOD 
what if my roommate knew about my nigerian publisher ,COMMA mukta bakaray ,COMMA a remarkable man who left his job in a bank to follow his dream and start a publishing house ?QUESTIONMARK 
he disagreed .PERIOD he felt that people who could read ,COMMA would read ,COMMA if you made literature affordable and available to them .PERIOD 
what if my roommate knew about the female lawyer who recently went to court in nigeria to challenge a ridiculous law that required women to get their husband's consent before renewing their passports ?QUESTIONMARK 
stories matter .PERIOD 
we face momentous decisions with important consequences throughout our lives ,COMMA and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions .PERIOD 
we've surrendered our power ,COMMA trading off our discomfort with uncertainty for the illusion of certainty that they provide .PERIOD 
it literally flat-lined .PERIOD 
but what my research has shown me is that experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps ,COMMA that within these camps ,COMMA a dominant perspective emerges that often silences opposition ,COMMA that experts move with the prevailing winds ,COMMA often hero-worshipping their own gurus .PERIOD 
a recent study in the archives of surgery reported surgeons removing healthy ovaries ,COMMA operating on the wrong side of the brain ,COMMA carrying out procedures on the wrong hand ,COMMA elbow ,COMMA eye ,COMMA foot ,COMMA and also mistakes born out of thinking errors .PERIOD 
why was it that ,COMMA when i had an operation ,COMMA my doctor said to me ,COMMA beware ,COMMA ms. hertz ,COMMA of hyperpyrexia ,COMMA when he could have just as easily said ,COMMA watch out for a high fever .PERIOD 
you see ,COMMA being ready to take experts on is about also being willing to dig behind their graphs ,COMMA their equations ,COMMA their forecasts ,COMMA their prophecies ,COMMA and being armed with the questions to do that - questions like :COLON what are the assumptions that underpin this ?QUESTIONMARK 
if we are to shift paradigms ,COMMA if we are to make breakthroughs ,COMMA if we are to destroy myths ,COMMA we need to create an environment in which expert ideas are battling it out ,COMMA in which we're bringing in new ,COMMA diverse ,COMMA discordant ,COMMA heretical views into the discussion ,COMMA fearlessly ,COMMA in the knowledge that progress comes about ,COMMA not only from the creation of ideas ,COMMA but also from their destruction - and also from the knowledge that ,COMMA by surrounding ourselves by divergent ,COMMA discordant ,COMMA heretical views .PERIOD 
google ceo eric schmidt is a practical practitioner of this philosophy .PERIOD 
but just imagine if we were to junk this notion of expertise as some sort of elite cadre and instead embrace the notion of democratized expertise - whereby expertise was not just the preserve of surgeons and ceo's ,COMMA but also shop-girls - yeah .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
and so the thought that i started with was how do you do this ,COMMA still within the boundary of the science we know today - no time for science fair ,COMMA no time for playing around with things or waiting for the magic battery to show up .PERIOD 
first component is you charge the car whenever you stop - ends up that cars are these strange beasts that drive for about two hours and park for about <NUM> hours .PERIOD 
now that last mile ,COMMA last foot ,COMMA in a sense ,COMMA is the first step of the infrastructure .PERIOD 
what we found out ,COMMA when you move from molecules to electrons ,COMMA something interesting happens .PERIOD 
we have a battery bay .PERIOD it costs the same hundred dollars as the gas tank .PERIOD 
those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means - in the average consumer environment we're in in the u.s .PERIOD 
that's a new economic factor ,COMMA which is fascinating to most people .PERIOD 
so we went out ,COMMA and we looked at all the car companies .PERIOD 
and i had to quit and come and do this thing called a better place .PERIOD 
we decided to come into the u.s .PERIOD 
the foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground .PERIOD 
by <NUM> we would have had at least <NUM> million new cars even at the pace we're going at right now .PERIOD 
and then we do the opec stimulus package also known as <NUM> dollars a barrel .PERIOD 
and that's the difference between problems that are additive ,COMMA like co2 ,COMMA which we go slowly up and then we tip ,COMMA and problems that are depletive ,COMMA in which we lose what we have ,COMMA which oscillate ,COMMA and they oscillate until we lose everything we've got .PERIOD 
you have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars .PERIOD 
you're looking at a world where cars are matched with windmills .PERIOD 
that's one percent a year .PERIOD 
and when we go to cop15 at the end of this year we can't stop thinking of padding co2 .PERIOD 
we have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries that are willing to go to this kind of scale .PERIOD 
and there will be about a <NUM> percent chance we'll recover him .PERIOD 
we have to make it immediately .PERIOD 
and we need to do it not within <NUM> years or <NUM> years ,COMMA but within this presidential term because if we don't ,COMMA we will lose our economy ,COMMA right after we'd lost our morality .PERIOD 
they see us as rocking the boat ,COMMA and you can understand why .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA it may sound as though i'm about to preach atheism ,COMMA and i want to reassure you that that's not what i'm going to do .PERIOD 
essentially ,COMMA it does it by providing a smooth ramp of gradual step-by-step increment .PERIOD 
it turns out to be ,COMMA in principle ,COMMA incapable of doing the job required of it .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we're used to not challenging religious ideas and it's very interesting how much of a furor richard creates when he does it .PERIOD he meant me ,COMMA not that one .PERIOD 
it teaches them to accept authority ,COMMA revelation and faith instead of always insisting on evidence .PERIOD 
but suppose - - in <NUM> ,COMMA a reporter asked george bush ,COMMA sr .PERIOD 
whether he recognized the equal citizenship and patriotism of americans who are atheists .PERIOD 
she clearly feels in a beleaguered minority ,COMMA but actually ,COMMA how do american atheists stack up numerically ?QUESTIONMARK 
the survey that i quoted ,COMMA which is the aris survey ,COMMA didn't break down its data by socio-economic class or education ,COMMA iq or anything else .PERIOD 
but let me know show you some data that have been properly published and analyzed on one special group ,COMMA namely ,COMMA top scientists .PERIOD 
in <NUM> ,COMMA larson and witham polled the cream of american scientists ,COMMA those who'd been honored by election to the national academy of sciences ,COMMA and among this select group ,COMMA belief in a personal god dropped to a shattering seven percent .PERIOD 
similar figures obtained for belief in personal immortality .PERIOD 
i've not seen corresponding figures for elite scholars in other fields ,COMMA such history or philosophy ,COMMA but i'd be surprised if they were different .PERIOD 
and i've already hinted what that something is .PERIOD 
from what i've seen of ted ,COMMA i think this may be the ideal place to launch it .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA i fear it will cost money .PERIOD 
i suspect that the word atheist itself contains or remains a stumbling block far out of proportion to what it actually means ,COMMA and a stumbling block to people who otherwise might be happy to out themselves .PERIOD 
hence the phrase ,COMMA tooth fairy agnostic .PERIOD 
the onus is not on the rest of us to say why not .PERIOD 
but we don't bother to say so ,COMMA and this is why my friend uses tooth fairy agnostic as a label for what most people would call atheist .PERIOD 
when atheists like stephen hawking and albert einstein use the word god ,COMMA they use it of course as a metaphorical shorthand for that deep ,COMMA mysterious part of physics which we don't yet understand .PERIOD 
what i want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories and talk about a different africa .PERIOD 
this is a story about the fact that people want their resources managed properly for their good ,COMMA and not taken out to places where they'll benefit just a few of the elite .PERIOD 
because if we can get the <NUM> billion dollars sitting out there back ,COMMA it may be far more for some of these countries than all the aid that is being put together .PERIOD 
one in four sub-saharan africans is nigerian ,COMMA and it has <NUM> million dynamic people - chaotic people - but very interesting people .PERIOD you'll never be bored .PERIOD 
not the international monetary fund .PERIOD not the world bank ,COMMA where i worked for <NUM> years and rose to be a vice president .PERIOD 
you couldn't get it .PERIOD you had to bribe .PERIOD 
the smartest one ,COMMA first to come in ,COMMA was the mtn company of south africa .PERIOD 
nigerians themselves began to develop some wireless telecommunications companies ,COMMA and three or four others have come in .PERIOD 
and we had gdp grow from an average of <NUM> percent the previous decade to about <NUM> percent now .PERIOD 
we consolidated them from <NUM> to <NUM> banks by requiring that they increase their capital - share capital .PERIOD 
in tourism ,COMMA in many african countries ,COMMA a great opportunity .PERIOD 
but you should know that this continent is not - is a continent of many countries ,COMMA not one country .PERIOD 
but imagine the impact on a family :COLON if the parents can be employed and make sure that their children go to school ,COMMA that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves .PERIOD 
if we can invest in places where you yourselves make money whilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet ,COMMA isn't that a wonderful opportunity ?QUESTIONMARK isn't that the way to go ?QUESTIONMARK 
mixing african materials ,COMMA such as we have ,COMMA with materials from elsewhere .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA to start helping that ,COMMA i want to take us back to <NUM> .PERIOD 
four and a half million users around the world ,COMMA contributing their leftover computer cycles ,COMMA whenever their computer isn't working ,COMMA by running a screen saver ,COMMA and together sharing their resources to create a massive supercomputer that nasa harnesses to analyze the data coming from radio telescopes .PERIOD 
what this picture suggests to us is that we've got a radical change in the way information production and exchange is capitalized .PERIOD not that it's become less capital intensive - that there's less money that's required - but that the ownership of this capital ,COMMA the way the capitalization happens ,COMMA is radically distributed .PERIOD each of us ,COMMA in these advanced economies ,COMMA has one of these ,COMMA or something rather like it - a computer .PERIOD 
it used to be wireless was one person owned the license ,COMMA they transmitted in an area ,COMMA and it had to be decided whether they would be licensed or based on property .PERIOD 
it was too expensive to have decentralized social production ,COMMA to have decentralized action in society .PERIOD that was not about society itself .PERIOD 
it's that it's the first time that it's having major economic impact .PERIOD 
you have to hire them to spend a lot of time .PERIOD 
it's creating ,COMMA and it's most visible when we see it as a new form of competition .PERIOD 
peer-to-peer networks assaulting the recording industry ;SEMICOLON free and open source software taking market share from microsoft ;SEMICOLON skype potentially threatening traditional telecoms ;SEMICOLON wikipedia competing with online encyclopedias .PERIOD 
and you see surfers ,COMMA people who see this happening ,COMMA and in some sense build it into a supply chain ,COMMA which is a very curious one .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK 
in <NUM> ,COMMA a new virus appeared that killed some <NUM> to <NUM> million people .PERIOD 
it spread like wildfire and some died within hours of developing symptoms .PERIOD 
when they work ,COMMA they can make history ,COMMA but after a while you can barely hear them .PERIOD 
or polio ?QUESTIONMARK how many of you remember the iron lung ?QUESTIONMARK 
so let's explore how vaccines work .PERIOD 
when you're pre-immunized ,COMMA what happens is you have forces in your body pre-trained to recognize and defeat specific foes .PERIOD 
seth berkley :COLON really cool video ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK 
in addition ,COMMA wild aquatic birds carry all known strains of influenza .PERIOD 
now luckily ,COMMA that particular virus ,COMMA although very scary at the time ,COMMA did not transmit from person to person very easily .PERIOD 
we've got these new antibodies we've identified ,COMMA and we know that they latch onto many ,COMMA many variations of the virus .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the research that has occurred from hiv now has really helped with innovation with other diseases .PERIOD 
so far ,COMMA animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease ,COMMA although you might get a mild case .PERIOD 
it was a slow ,COMMA cumbersome process that depended on chicken eggs ,COMMA millions of living chicken eggs .PERIOD 
now think of where this leads us .PERIOD 
new infectious diseases appear or reappear every few years .PERIOD 
will we be quick enough to react before millions die ?QUESTIONMARK 
you also can use adjuvants ,COMMA which are chemicals you mix .PERIOD 
i call them the cheetah generation .PERIOD 
the cheetah generation is a new breed of africans who brook no nonsense about corruption .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA we're talking about a continent that is not poor .PERIOD 
there are people who think that we should pour more money ,COMMA more aid into this bowl which leaks .PERIOD 
let's take food imports .PERIOD 
just add that up ,COMMA all these leakages .PERIOD 
kwame nkrumah ,COMMA nyerere ,COMMA kenyatta - somebody mentioned idi amin .PERIOD 
by creating wealth ?QUESTIONMARK 
and you can't develop the informal and the traditional sectors without an operational understanding of how these two sectors work .PERIOD 
without the council the chief can't pass any law ,COMMA and if the chief doesn't govern according to the will of the people he will be removed .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it's quite appropriate that this section is called a marketplace .PERIOD 
what africans practiced was a different form of capitalism ,COMMA but then after independence ,COMMA all of a sudden ,COMMA markets ,COMMA capitalism became a western institution ,COMMA and the leaders said africans were ready for socialism .PERIOD 
a bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and landed .PERIOD 
they're people getting out of poverty as fast as they can .PERIOD 
and the journalist was asking him ,COMMA why is this so important ?QUESTIONMARK 
they disappeared .PERIOD 
but a couple of weeks ago ,COMMA i asked a bunch of friends to google egypt and to send me screen shots of what they got .PERIOD 
and the thing is that the algorithms don't yet have the kind of embedded ethics that the editors did .PERIOD 
now i have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
we went in and sat down at the booth ,COMMA and the waitress came over ,COMMA made a big commotion over tipper .PERIOD 
she said yes ,COMMA that's former vice president al gore and his wife tipper .PERIOD 
it's like beachcombing ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK every time the tide comes in and out ,COMMA you find some more shells .PERIOD 
it's an easy ,COMMA visible target of concern ,COMMA and it should be ,COMMA but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks .PERIOD 
insulation ,COMMA better design ,COMMA buy green electricity where you can .PERIOD 
a lot of us in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easy .PERIOD 
it doesn't mean that if you are a republican that i'm trying to convince you to be a democrat .PERIOD we need republicans as well .PERIOD this used to be a bipartisan issue ,COMMA and i know that in this group it really is .PERIOD become politically active .PERIOD 
we have to buy a lot of those ads .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA the republicans here ,COMMA this shouldn't be partisan .PERIOD 
and all the burning of oil and coal and gas ,COMMA all the fossil fuels ,COMMA have changed the atmosphere greatly .PERIOD 
and one of the really most incredible things ,COMMA i think ,COMMA is that there's nobody out there trying to collect it at the site where it is densest .PERIOD 
you see people who are really shell-shocked .PERIOD 
so this is the gulf of mexico ,COMMA sparkling place full of fish .PERIOD 
you can see where the oil is concentrated at the surface ,COMMA and then it is attacked ,COMMA because they don't want the evidence ,COMMA in my opinion .PERIOD 
we heard that bacteria eat oil ?QUESTIONMARK 
so do sea turtles .PERIOD 
when it breaks up ,COMMA it has a long way to go before it gets down to bacteria .PERIOD 
i heard the most incredible story today when i was on the train coming here .PERIOD 
that's the story of thousands of people .PERIOD 
the other thing about the gulf that is important is that there are a lot of animals that concentrate in the gulf at certain parts of the year .PERIOD 
if it's not ,COMMA it's certainly affecting their eggs and larvae ,COMMA i would certainly think .PERIOD 
so while the oil spill ,COMMA the leak ,COMMA the eruption ,COMMA is a catastrophe ,COMMA i think it's important to keep in mind that we've done a lot to affect what's in the ocean for a very ,COMMA very long time .PERIOD 
we're starting with something that's had a lot of stresses and a lot of problems to begin with .PERIOD 
it's just ridiculous .PERIOD 
i think that this is the result of gross negligence .PERIOD 
the first offshore drills were called harpoons .PERIOD 
your sequence and mine are slightly different .PERIOD 
i've got brown eyes ;SEMICOLON you might have blue or gray .PERIOD 
i think we should say it all together .PERIOD 
and still ,COMMA you may not see the branches .PERIOD 
but seriously ,COMMA what's wrong with this ?QUESTIONMARK 
you already know enough to tell me - what's wrong with this statement ?QUESTIONMARK 
and so let's do a series of comparisons to show you .PERIOD 
i assure you ,COMMA this is very tiny .PERIOD it's just six microns on a side .PERIOD 
and that's just a mouse brain - it's a lot smaller than a human brain .PERIOD 
i feel curiosity ,COMMA and i feel wonder ,COMMA but at times i have also felt despair .PERIOD 
why did i choose to study this organ that is so awesome in its complexity that it might well be infinite ?QUESTIONMARK 
and there's a lot of evidence that neural activity is encoding our thoughts ,COMMA feelings and perceptions ,COMMA our mental experiences .PERIOD 
and if you put those two facts together ,COMMA it means that your experiences can change your connectome .PERIOD 
and it might true that just the mere act of thinking can change your connectome - an idea that you may find empowering .PERIOD 
and so we might even speak of the stream of consciousness .PERIOD 
i'll give you a hint .PERIOD it's a big number .PERIOD 
zach kaplan :COLON keith and i lead a research team .PERIOD 
because the way that he presented the concept - his approach was totally different than ours .PERIOD he sold it to you as if it was for sale right now .PERIOD 
inventables water adventures dares you to launch yourself on a magnetically-levitating board down a waterslide so fast ,COMMA so tall ,COMMA that when you hit the bottom ,COMMA it uses brakes to stop .PERIOD 
in addition ,COMMA you can see from the diagram on the right ,COMMA the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet .PERIOD 
so i'm sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum is a metal ,COMMA it's not a magnetic material .PERIOD but something unexpected happens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube .PERIOD 
it's perfectly clear ,COMMA it's odorless ,COMMA it's colorless .PERIOD 
shape-retaining is common in metal :COLON you bend a piece of aluminum foil ,COMMA and it holds its place .PERIOD contrast that with a plastic garbage can - and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back .PERIOD 
so my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book .PERIOD 
for our last technology ,COMMA we worked again with roman and his team at the directors bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works .PERIOD 
and these dyes change color in response to odors .PERIOD 
by detecting the odor of particular bacteria ,COMMA or viruses ,COMMA or even lung cancer ,COMMA the dots will change and they can use software to analyze the results .PERIOD 
because every one of these six changed our understanding of what was possible in the world .PERIOD prior to seeing this ,COMMA we would have assumed :COLON a 10-foot pole couldn't fit in your pocket ;SEMICOLON something as inexpensive as ink couldn't sense the way paper is being bent ;SEMICOLON every one of these things - and we're constantly trying to find more .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA it's crucified .PERIOD 
spanish chef accused of cheating .PERIOD 
a huge scandal for a few weeks .PERIOD 
that is ,COMMA until i went to eduardo's farm in extremadura ,COMMA <NUM> miles north of seville ,COMMA right on the portugal border .PERIOD 
i'm just here to give the geese what they want .PERIOD 
i was speaking too loudly .PERIOD 
right up to us ,COMMA like right up to here .PERIOD

a big part of his income for his farm .PERIOD 
that's how i've been trained .PERIOD 
so i'm listening to all this ,COMMA you know ,COMMA and i'm like ,COMMA is this guy for real ?QUESTIONMARK is he making some of this up ?QUESTIONMARK 
is he like ,COMMA you know - because he seemed to have an answer for everything ,COMMA and it was always nature .PERIOD 
because ,COMMA really ,COMMA they want you to look at themselves ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
to fly south in the winter and north when it gets warm ?QUESTIONMARK 
and the problem with saying that ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is that you know ,COMMA at this point it risks hyperbole really easily .PERIOD 
i'm really in love with him at this point .PERIOD 
he takes the liver when he harvests the foie gras ,COMMA he sticks them in this jar and he confits it .PERIOD 
no salt ,COMMA no pepper ,COMMA no oil ,COMMA no spices .PERIOD 
we went back out for the final tour of the farm ,COMMA and he showed me the wild pepper plants and the plants that he made sure existed on his farm for salinity .PERIOD 
how come you don't give him this ?QUESTIONMARK 
i really was moved .PERIOD 
the pharaoh got wind of this and wanted to taste it .PERIOD 
and the jews ,COMMA fearing for their life ,COMMA had to come up with an ingenious idea ,COMMA or at least try and satisfy the pharaoh's wishes ,COMMA of course .PERIOD 
one in which we stop treating the planet as if it were some kind of business in liquidation .PERIOD 
whether we're talking about brussels sprouts or foie gras .PERIOD 
that is our poetry .PERIOD that is our beautiful story .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA i can see ,COMMA if i found something ,COMMA up ,COMMA up ,COMMA and they continue ,COMMA up up up .PERIOD 
you ,COMMA you survive .PERIOD it's ok .PERIOD 
nobody's obliged to be a genius .PERIOD 
it's better ,COMMA but nobody .PERIOD 
this line of evolution is clearly positive .PERIOD 
but if you take a lens ,COMMA like that ,COMMA this line is ack ,COMMA ack ,COMMA ack ,COMMA ack ,COMMA ack .PERIOD like that .PERIOD 
there is different type of barbaria .PERIOD 
that's why today i'm so ashamed to make this job .PERIOD 
but i know that even i do it the best possible - that's why i'm the best - it's nothing .PERIOD 
and because we must all work to finish this story .PERIOD 
this scenario ,COMMA of this civilization ,COMMA was about becoming powerful ,COMMA intelligent ,COMMA like this idea we have invented ,COMMA this concept of god .PERIOD 
you go to the future back ,COMMA back ,COMMA back ,COMMA back ,COMMA like that .PERIOD 
he would also supply me with tools .PERIOD 
it was this great magic store .PERIOD it was a crappy little building in midtown ,COMMA but you'd be in the elevator ,COMMA the elevator would open - there'd be this little ,COMMA small magic store .PERIOD you'd be in the magic store .PERIOD

so there's that .PERIOD in terms of the content of it ,COMMA you look at stories ,COMMA you think ,COMMA well ,COMMA what are stories but mystery boxes ?QUESTIONMARK 
then there's the thing of mystery in terms of imagination - the withholding of information .PERIOD you know ,COMMA doing that intentionally is much more engaging .PERIOD 
die hard ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK crazy ,COMMA great ,COMMA fun ,COMMA action-adventure movie in a building .PERIOD 
there are great scenes - maybe not the most amazing dramatic scenes in the history of time ,COMMA but pretty great scenes .PERIOD 
father :COLON'cause i need it .PERIOD 
come on !EXCLAMATIONMARK so you think of jaws - so that's the kind of stuff that ,COMMA like ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the investment of character ,COMMA which is the stuff that really is inside the box ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's why when people do sequels ,COMMA or rip off movies ,COMMA you know ,COMMA of a genre ,COMMA they're ripping off the wrong thing .PERIOD 
you got ta rip off - you know ,COMMA if you rip something off - rip off the character .PERIOD 
because ultimately ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the mystery box is all of us .PERIOD so there's that .PERIOD 
the moment the lights go down is often the best part ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
and you're full of that amazing - that feeling of excited anticipation .PERIOD 
the stuff that i was lucky and begging for to get when i was a kid is now ubiquitous .PERIOD

and in the egyptian revolution ,COMMA the revolution <NUM> ,COMMA everyone has contributed something ,COMMA small or big .PERIOD they contributed something - to bring us one of the most inspiring stories in the history of mankind when it comes to revolutions .PERIOD 
it was actually really inspiring to see all these egyptians completely changing .PERIOD 
but the reason why everyone was silent is what i call the psychological barrier of fear .PERIOD 
and that psychological barrier of fear had worked for so many years ,COMMA and here comes the internet ,COMMA technology ,COMMA blackberry ,COMMA sms .PERIOD 
platforms like youtube ,COMMA twitter ,COMMA facebook were helping us a lot because it basically gave us the impression that ,COMMA wow ,COMMA i'm not alone .PERIOD 
they probably have the best life in the world .PERIOD 
and everyone started to think that this guy could be my brother .PERIOD 
what are we going to do ?QUESTIONMARK i don't know .PERIOD 
in a few days ,COMMA tens of thousands of people there - angry egyptians who were asking the ministry of interior affairs ,COMMA enough .PERIOD 
but of course ,COMMA they don't listen .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA one of the most ridiculous ideas was ,COMMA hey ,COMMA let's have a silent stand .PERIOD 
there was no leader .PERIOD 
and i'm not going to talk about my experience ,COMMA because this is not about me .PERIOD 
the next day i was in tahrir .PERIOD 
when i saw that ,COMMA i went back and i wrote on facebook .PERIOD 
but today i'm going to talk to you about something you can't see - what's going on up in that little brain of hers .PERIOD 
and therein lies a critical puzzle .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA it's got to do with your brain .PERIOD 
but we as adults are no longer absorbing those statistics .PERIOD 
it takes a human being for babies to take their statistics .PERIOD

just as the poets and writers described ,COMMA we're going to be able to see ,COMMA i think ,COMMA that wondrous openness ,COMMA utter and complete openness ,COMMA of the mind of a child .PERIOD

the rags were unwrapped from a little girl whose body was massively burned .PERIOD 
it was the young women ,COMMA the health aids ,COMMA who cleaned the wounds of this baby and dressed the wounds .PERIOD 
and my family brought in a woman whose mother had been a slave to take care of me .PERIOD 
and that woman did not have sentimental compassion .PERIOD 
i had that condition ,COMMA to a certain extent ,COMMA from my own childhood illness .PERIOD 
and in that paralysis ,COMMA of course ,COMMA our capacity for compassion is also paralyzed .PERIOD 
the very word terror is global .PERIOD 
so our work ,COMMA in a certain way ,COMMA is to address this imago ,COMMA this kind of archetype that has pervaded the psyche of our entire globe .PERIOD 
hey ,COMMA we live in a very noxious world .PERIOD 
why don't we train our children in compassion ?QUESTIONMARK 
women have manifested for thousands of years the strength arising from compassion in an unfiltered ,COMMA unmediated way in perceiving suffering as it is .PERIOD 
and they have actualized compassion through direct action .PERIOD 
he sees that the dog has this big wound on its leg .PERIOD 
i was one of the founding members of the axis of evil comedy tour .PERIOD 
then there was aron kader ,COMMA who was the palestinian-american .PERIOD 
and i opened it up ,COMMA it said ,COMMA born in iran .PERIOD i'm like ,COMMA oh ,COMMA come on ,COMMA man .PERIOD 
ah ha !EXCLAMATIONMARK american ,COMMA great .PERIOD 
his name was jabbar .PERIOD 
he says ,COMMA you wait .PERIOD i'll be back ,COMMA and he walked away .PERIOD 
like a couple months ago in times square in new york ,COMMA there was this pakistani muslim guy who tried to blow up a car bomb .PERIOD 
and one thing that happened there was also the pakistani taliban took credit for that failed car bombing .PERIOD 
we just wanted to say we tried .PERIOD 
out of my way .PERIOD out of my way .PERIOD out of my way .PERIOD 
you want some frozen yogurt ?QUESTIONMARK 
i have one gram ,COMMA five gram ,COMMA <NUM> gram .PERIOD how many gram do you want ?QUESTIONMARK 
i put my two year-old on the slide ;SEMICOLON he went frrmrmm !EXCLAMATIONMARK he took off .PERIOD 
i went down .PERIOD i go ,COMMA where's my son ?QUESTIONMARK 
i go ,COMMA i'm sorry .PERIOD then why were you staring at me ?QUESTIONMARK 
so i would like to show you something i've been working on .PERIOD 
he had this wonderful trick where a rosebush would bloom right in front of your eyes .PERIOD 
but it was his production of a butterfly that was the most beautiful .PERIOD 
marco tempest :COLON when asked about deception ,COMMA he said this :COLON announcer :COLON magic is the only honest profession .PERIOD 
i use a lot of tricks ,COMMA which means that sometimes i have to lie to you .PERIOD 
girl in phone :COLON hey ,COMMA where are you ?QUESTIONMARK 
lady :COLON i'll be ready in just a minute ,COMMA darling .PERIOD 
self-deception .PERIOD 
which is why in this vast and lonely cosmos ,COMMA we are so wonderfully optimistic .PERIOD 
put a crab inside it .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA the guy replies ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA i know ,COMMA i know .PERIOD 
i'm like a junior varsity cheerleader sometimes - for swearing ,COMMA awkward silences ,COMMA and very simple rhyme schemes .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA as many of you may remember ,COMMA the red brigades was a terrorist ,COMMA marxist organization which was very active in italy from the <NUM> until the <NUM> .PERIOD 
as part of their strategy the red brigades never spoke with anybody ,COMMA not even with their lawyers .PERIOD 
in <NUM> they declared the end of the armed struggle .PERIOD 
but this is exactly what i did because i wanted to know what had turned my best friend into a terrorist ,COMMA and why she'd never tried to recruit me .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA because i am a trained economist and i think in economic terms ,COMMA all of the sudden i thought ,COMMA maybe there is something here .PERIOD 
and there are three main stages .PERIOD 
but above all ,COMMA they started to do serious business with the world of crime .PERIOD 
rogue economics is a force which is constantly lurking in the background of history .PERIOD 
and it actually happened again ,COMMA with the fall of the berlin wall .PERIOD 
what does it mean ?QUESTIONMARK that means that it has a privilege that other countries do not have .PERIOD 
this privilege is called seigniorage .PERIOD 
no other country can do that .PERIOD 
what the patriot act did was to prohibit u.s. bank ,COMMA and u.s.registered foreign banks from doing any businesses with off-shore facilities .PERIOD 
it also gave the u.s. monetary authorities the right to monitor any dollar transaction taking place anywhere in the world .PERIOD 
it was introduced only in the united states .PERIOD 
in europe ,COMMA a similar legislation was not introduced .PERIOD 
cumulatively ,COMMA i will have rowed over <NUM> miles ,COMMA taken over three million oar strokes and spent more than <NUM> days alone on the ocean on a <NUM> foot rowboat .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA some of you might be thinking ,COMMA hold on a minute .PERIOD she doesn't look very much like an ocean rower .PERIOD 
i thought there were them and there were us ,COMMA and i was not one of them .PERIOD 
and i think i knew from day one that it wasn't the right job for me .PERIOD 
i'd gone through some changes .PERIOD 
and i remember looking at these two versions of my obituary and thinking ,COMMA oh boy ,COMMA i'm on totally the wrong track here .PERIOD 
it was a bit like finishing a marathon and getting out of solitary confinement and winning an oscar all rolled into one .PERIOD 
mostly ,COMMA a baseball cap ,COMMA rowing gloves and a smile - or a frown ,COMMA depending on whether i went backwards overnight - and lots of sun lotion .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA because nobody in their straight mind would row straight past hawaii without dropping in ,COMMA i decided to cut this very big undertaking into three segments .PERIOD 
but what do you do ?QUESTIONMARK 
i had a meeting with the president there ,COMMA who told me about his exit strategy for his country .PERIOD 
i even met one of them and she was just about my size .PERIOD 
this is a world-wide community .PERIOD 
i plan on being around for a long time ,COMMA and when i'm <NUM> years old ,COMMA i want to be happy and healthy .PERIOD 
it's very difficult to be healthy on a planet where we've poisoned the earth and the sea and the air .PERIOD 
and the idea here is that all our eco-heroes will log at least one green deed every day .PERIOD 
and if you put creation and optimism together ,COMMA you've got two choices that you can talk about .PERIOD 
this has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time .PERIOD 
this was a scheme by a team called think ,COMMA a new york-based team ,COMMA and then there was that one ,COMMA which was the libeskind scheme .PERIOD 
we all want to go out and buy an audi tt ,COMMA don't we ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's in our nature to go ricocheting back and forth between this technocratic solution and a larger ,COMMA sort of more romantic image of where we are .PERIOD 
and these are two of the top architectural practices in the united states today .PERIOD 
yeah ,COMMA it's one of those giant camera lenses that takes a picture of the outside world - it's sort of a little movie ,COMMA without any moving parts - and projects it on a page ,COMMA and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it .PERIOD 
they all want to save money by building the same thing <NUM> times .PERIOD 
here's the little drawing that tells them how that works - and that's what will happen in the end .PERIOD 
so let's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana .PERIOD 
so they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune .PERIOD 
only one of whom had ever seen the plans before .PERIOD 
it has its own built-in swimming pool ,COMMA very ,COMMA very cool .PERIOD 
here it is going across .PERIOD and there ,COMMA down the other side ,COMMA and you get the same kind of grandeur .PERIOD 
i want you to know the room you're looking at is stark white .PERIOD 
rosa mexicano restaurant ,COMMA where he transports us to the shores of acapulco ,COMMA up on the upper west side ,COMMA with this wall of cliff divers who - there you go ,COMMA like that .PERIOD 
boo hewerdine ,COMMA thomas dolby ,COMMA thank you very much for inviting me .PERIOD it's been a blessing singing for you .PERIOD 
right now is the most exciting time to see new indian art .PERIOD 
this next artist ,COMMA n.s .PERIOD harsha ,COMMA actually has a studio right here in mysore .PERIOD 
he's putting a contemporary spin on the miniature tradition .PERIOD 
he creates these fine ,COMMA delicate images which he then repeats on a massive scale .PERIOD 
this next artist is probably the alpha male of contemporary indian art ,COMMA subodh gupta .PERIOD 
but i can only hope i've whet your appetite to go out and see and learn more about the amazing things that are happening in art in india today .PERIOD 
so i'm going to show you some ways that we can violate your expectations .PERIOD first of all ,COMMA i want to show you the particular illusion here .PERIOD i want you first of all when it pops up on the screen to notice that the two holes are perpendicular to each other .PERIOD these are all perceptual tricks .PERIOD these are real objects that i'm going to show you .PERIOD now i'm going to show you how it is done .PERIOD i've looped the film here so you can get a very interesting experience .PERIOD i want you to see how this illusion is constructed ,COMMA and it's going to rotate so you see that it's inside out .PERIOD now watch ,COMMA as it rotates back ,COMMA how quickly your perception snaps .PERIOD ok now .PERIOD 
how many of you here see dolphins ?QUESTIONMARK raise your hand if you see dolphins .PERIOD ok ,COMMA those people who raised their hands ,COMMA afterwards ,COMMA the rest of the audience ,COMMA go talk to them ,COMMA all right ?QUESTIONMARK actually ,COMMA this is the best example of priming by experience that i know .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA something like this can be used because this is after all talk about design ,COMMA too .PERIOD this was done by saatchi and saatchi ,COMMA and they actually got away with this ad in australia .PERIOD so ,COMMA if you look at this ad for beer ,COMMA all those people are in sort of provocative positions .PERIOD but they got it passed ,COMMA and actually won the clio awards ,COMMA so it's funny how you can do these things .PERIOD 
you can violate your expectations about experience .PERIOD here is an outside water fountain that i created with some friends of mine ,COMMA but you can stop the water in drops and - actually make all the drops levitate .PERIOD this is something we're building for ,COMMA you know ,COMMA amusement parks and that kind of stuff .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA there's analog and digital .PERIOD thought that was appropriate here .PERIOD 
and it's interesting ,COMMA by doing this in this sort of rendered fashion ,COMMA how much stronger the illusions are .PERIOD any case ,COMMA i hope this has brought you a little joy and happiness ,COMMA and if you're interested in seeing more cool effects ,COMMA see me outside .PERIOD i'd be happy to show you lots of things .PERIOD 
so i want to share with you a couple key insights about complexity we're learning from studying nature that maybe are applicable to other problems .PERIOD 
i'm here today ,COMMA as june said ,COMMA to talk about a project that my twin sister and i have been doing for the past three and half years .PERIOD 
this is our invocation in crochet of a bleached reef .PERIOD 
so we went and taught the techniques .PERIOD we did workshops and lectures .PERIOD 
the frilly crenulated forms that you see in corals ,COMMA and kelps ,COMMA and sponges and nudibranchs ,COMMA is a form of geometry known as hyperbolic geometry .PERIOD 
and the only way that mathematicians know how to model this structure is with crochet .PERIOD it happens to be a fact .PERIOD 
before hyperbolic geometry ,COMMA mathematicians knew about two kinds of space :COLON euclidean space ,COMMA and spherical space .PERIOD 
and they have different properties .PERIOD 
think of the surface of a sphere - just like a beach ball ,COMMA the surface of the earth .PERIOD 
and on the surface of a sphere ,COMMA a straight line is the biggest possible circle you can draw .PERIOD 
to a mathematician if there are two answers ,COMMA and the first two are zero and one ,COMMA there is another number that immediately suggests itself as the third alternative .PERIOD 
this nearly drove mathematicians bonkers because ,COMMA like you ,COMMA they're sitting there feeling bamboozled .PERIOD 
i've stitched euclid's parallel postulate on to the surface .PERIOD 
here's two creatures who've never heard of euclid's parallel postulate - didn't know it was impossible to violate ,COMMA and they're simply getting on with it .PERIOD 
i once asked the mathematicians why it was that mathematicians thought this structure was impossible when sea slugs have been doing it since the silurian age .PERIOD 
and that's true .PERIOD but it also goes deeper than that .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA too ,COMMA we've discovered that there is an infinite taxonomy of crochet hyperbolic creatures .PERIOD 
but we found that when we deviated from the specific setness of the mathematical code that underlies it - the simple algorithm crochet three ,COMMA increase one - when we deviated from that and made embellishments to the code ,COMMA the models immediately started to look more natural .PERIOD 
and kindergarten was actually a very formalized system of education ,COMMA established by a man named friedrich froebel ,COMMA who was a crystallographer in the <NUM> century .PERIOD 
he developed a radical alternative system of engaging the smallest children with the most abstract ideas through physical forms of play .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA so how do you study this mysterious organ ?QUESTIONMARK 
so let me give you a few striking examples of this .PERIOD 
and if you look ,COMMA tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes - you can't see it there - is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus .PERIOD 
but there's another rare syndrome ,COMMA so rare ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA that very few physicians have heard about it ,COMMA not even neurologists .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the most common interpretation of this ,COMMA which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks ,COMMA is a freudian view ,COMMA and that is that this chap - and the same argument applies to women ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA but i'll just talk about guys .PERIOD 
thank god ,COMMA or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother .PERIOD 
it's very ingenious ,COMMA as all freudian arguments are - - but didn't make much sense because i have seen the same delusion ,COMMA a patient having the same delusion ,COMMA about his pet poodle .PERIOD 
there are neurons there that are sensitive to faces .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA when that area's damaged ,COMMA you lose the ability to see faces ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
and then the message cascades into the amygdala ,COMMA and then goes down the autonomic nervous system .PERIOD 
there's no delusion through the phone .PERIOD 
and in fact ,COMMA one student asked me the other day ,COMMA do they get phantom pms ?QUESTIONMARK 
now ,COMMA why would a phantom limb be paralyzed ?QUESTIONMARK 
how do you unlearn the learned paralysis ,COMMA so you can relieve him of this excruciating ,COMMA clenching spasm of the phantom arm ?QUESTIONMARK 
he had a brachial avulsion ,COMMA so the nerves were cut and the arm was paralyzed ,COMMA lying in a sling for a year ,COMMA and then the arm was amputated .PERIOD 
my first patient came in ,COMMA and he looked in the mirror ,COMMA and i said ,COMMA look at your reflection of your phantom .PERIOD 
he knows it's a mirror reflection ,COMMA but it's a vivid sensory experience .PERIOD 
and he says ,COMMA oh my god ,COMMA my phantom is moving again .PERIOD i don't believe this !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
and then i said ,COMMA close your eyes .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i said ,COMMA look ,COMMA derek - well ,COMMA first of all ,COMMA the guy can't just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain - i said ,COMMA look ,COMMA derek ,COMMA take it home and practice with it for a week or two .PERIOD 
i said ,COMMA what's gone ?QUESTIONMARK 
these people muddle up their senses .PERIOD 
why does this happen ?QUESTIONMARK 
now remember - why does this happen ?QUESTIONMARK 
and that is ,COMMA there is an abnormal gene ,COMMA a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA every brain region is wired to every other region ,COMMA and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain .PERIOD 
it's because you're all doing a cross-model synesthetic abstraction ,COMMA meaning you're saying that that sharp inflection - ki-ki ,COMMA in your auditory cortex ,COMMA the hair cells being excited - kiki ,COMMA mimics the visual inflection ,COMMA sudden inflection of that jagged shape .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA this is very important ,COMMA because what it's telling you is your brain is engaging in a primitive - it's just - it looks like a silly illusion ,COMMA but these photons in your eye are doing this shape ,COMMA and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern ,COMMA but the brain is able to extract the common denominator .PERIOD 
sorry about that .PERIOD 
my talk will be in two parts .PERIOD i'll talk first as an astronomer ,COMMA and then as a worried member of the human race .PERIOD 
so that's another project for nasa .PERIOD 
it landed on the surface .PERIOD this is pictures taken on the way down .PERIOD 
there's scant chance of life there - that's because there's been no time for the nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron ,COMMA the building blocks of planets and of life .PERIOD 
and until we have that synthesis ,COMMA we won't be able to understand the very beginning of our universe because when our universe was itself the size of an atom ,COMMA quantum effects could shake everything .PERIOD 
you want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small ,COMMA but we want to understand the very complex .PERIOD 
we depend on stars to make the atoms we're made of .PERIOD 
we depend on chemistry to determine our complex structure .PERIOD 
the geometric mean of the mass of a proton and the mass of the sun is <NUM> kilograms ,COMMA within a factor of two of the mass of each person here .PERIOD 
if i was not a self-effacing brit ,COMMA i would mention the book myself ,COMMA and i would add that it's available in paperback .PERIOD 
first ,COMMA any scientific discovery has benign consequences as well as dangerous ones .PERIOD 
he persuaded einstein ,COMMA as his last act ,COMMA to sign the famous memorandum of bertrand russell .PERIOD 
we need not just campaigning physicists ,COMMA but we need biologists ,COMMA computer experts and environmentalists as well .PERIOD 
i wrote my book ,COMMA our final century ,COMMA as a scientist ,COMMA just a general scientist .PERIOD but there's one respect ,COMMA i think ,COMMA in which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective ,COMMA and that's that it offers an awareness of the immense future .PERIOD 
the stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past are now part of common culture - outside the american bible belt ,COMMA anyway - but most people ,COMMA even those who are familiar with evolution ,COMMA aren't mindful that even more time lies ahead .PERIOD 
the unfolding of intelligence and complexity still has immensely far to go ,COMMA here on earth and probably far beyond .PERIOD 
but let's suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot in the cosmos from afar ,COMMA not just for <NUM> years ,COMMA but for the entire <NUM> billion-year history of our earth .PERIOD 
then other things happened even more abruptly .PERIOD 
right now ,COMMA he's in a forest in georgia .PERIOD 
the bonobo ,COMMA although shorter than us and their arms still longer ,COMMA is more upright ,COMMA just as we are .PERIOD 
slim-bodied ,COMMA bonobos are by nature very gentle creatures .PERIOD 
this is kanzi and i ,COMMA in the forest .PERIOD 
we need more sticks ,COMMA too .PERIOD 
good job .PERIOD 
video :COLON kanzi now makes his tools ,COMMA just as our ancestors may have made them ,COMMA two-and-a-half million years ago - by holding the rocks in both hands ,COMMA to strike one against the other .PERIOD 
kanzi's rock is from gona ,COMMA ethiopia and is identical to that used by our african ancestors two-and-a-half million years ago .PERIOD 
she's also saying the name of that ,COMMA with her voice .PERIOD 
panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor .PERIOD 
ss :COLON very nice .PERIOD beautiful ,COMMA panbanisha .PERIOD 
the curved line is very similar to the lexigram .PERIOD 
the next symbol panbanisha writes represents collar .PERIOD 
researchers began to record what panbanisha said ,COMMA by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk .PERIOD 
then he peers eagerly into his mother's mouth .PERIOD 
narrator :COLON kanzi plays the xylophone ;SEMICOLON using both hands he enthusiastically accompanies dr. sue's singing .PERIOD 
kanzi and panbanisha are stimulated by this fun-filled environment ,COMMA which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities .PERIOD 
so we have a bi-species environment ,COMMA we call it a panhomoculture .PERIOD 
here's a site which allows you to look at recovery spending in california .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA this is the graph of the number of data sets in the repositories of data.gov ,COMMA and data.gov.uk .PERIOD 
and then you can select also other things on the map to see what other factors ,COMMA like the threat level .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA if you've been involved in that at all ,COMMA i just wanted to say :COLON whatever you've been doing ,COMMA whether you've just been chanting ,COMMA raw data now !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
a man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens ,COMMA it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space .PERIOD 
within a year ,COMMA congress funded huge weapons increases ,COMMA and we went from <NUM> nuclear weapons to <NUM> .PERIOD 
support for engineering ,COMMA math and science - education in general - boomed .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA if you'll put up with this ,COMMA i would like to enlist your help with a first experiment today .PERIOD the experiment is - and i notice ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA that when you applauded ,COMMA that you did it in a typical north american way ,COMMA that is ,COMMA you were raucous and incoherent .PERIOD 
so what do we make of that ?QUESTIONMARK first of all ,COMMA we know that you're all brilliant .PERIOD 
do you need to be alive ?QUESTIONMARK i mean ,COMMA that's a spooky thought ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
and you see that in nature .PERIOD 
keep in mind that ,COMMA although it looks as if each individual is acting to cooperate ,COMMA what's really going on is a kind of selfish darwinian behavior .PERIOD 
each is scattering away at random to try to save its scales or feathers .PERIOD 
as i say ,COMMA if you're in a swarm ,COMMA your odds of being the unlucky one are reduced as compared to a small group .PERIOD 
there doesn't seem to be anything mystical about this .PERIOD 
specifically ,COMMA it's male fireflies who are all flashing in perfect time together ,COMMA in perfect synchrony ,COMMA to reinforce a message to the females .PERIOD 
scientific papers were published saying it was twitching eyelids that explained it ,COMMA or ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a human being's tendency to see patterns where there are none .PERIOD 
but i hope you've convinced yourself now ,COMMA with this nighttime video ,COMMA that they really were very well synchronized .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA well ,COMMA the issue then is ,COMMA do we need to be alive to see this kind of spontaneous order ,COMMA and i've already hinted that the answer is no .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA you might think that's a bizarre idea .PERIOD 
he would shoot his light saber across the abyss ,COMMA making a blade of light ,COMMA and then scamper across on this blade of light .PERIOD 
think of the bridge as being like this platform .PERIOD 
narrator :COLON the most dramatic and shocking footage shows whole sections of the crowd - hundreds of people - apparently rocking from side to side in unison ,COMMA not only with each other ,COMMA but with the bridge .PERIOD 
this synchronized movement seemed to be driving the bridge .PERIOD 
but how could the crowd become synchronized ?QUESTIONMARK 
allan mcrobie is a bridge engineer from cambridge who wrote to me ,COMMA suggesting that a bridge simulator ought to wobble in the same way as the real bridge - provided we hung it on pendulums of exactly the right length .PERIOD 
their instructions :COLON just walk normally .PERIOD 
that indeed ,COMMA a mass extinction was underway in our fields ,COMMA in our agricultural system .PERIOD 
so if i were to going to show you all the beans in the world ,COMMA and i had a slide like this ,COMMA and i switched it every second ,COMMA it would take up my entire ted talk ,COMMA and i wouldn't have to say anything .PERIOD 
and i said ,COMMA you know what ?QUESTIONMARK these apples come from your ancestors ,COMMA and your ancestors gave them the greatest honor they could give them .PERIOD 
the bad news is they're extinct .PERIOD 
the coldest growing seasons of the future ,COMMA hotter than the hottest of the past .PERIOD 
and then there are just daily disasters that take place in these buildings ,COMMA financial problems and mismanagement and equipment failures ,COMMA and all kinds of things ,COMMA and every time something like this happens ,COMMA it means extinction .PERIOD we lose diversity .PERIOD 
because ,COMMA quite literally ,COMMA if agriculture doesn't adapt to climate change ,COMMA neither will we .PERIOD 
important health message :COLON blogging may be hazardous to your health ,COMMA especially if you are a male .PERIOD 
this is male blogging posture sitting ,COMMA and the result is ,COMMA for greater comfort ,COMMA men naturally sit with their legs farther apart than women ,COMMA when working on laptop .PERIOD 
this is a very serious research ,COMMA that you should read the underline .PERIOD 
wi-fi enables you to avoid the processor .PERIOD and there are some enhanced protection measures ,COMMA which i would like to share with you ,COMMA and i would like ,COMMA in a minute ,COMMA to thank philips for helping .PERIOD 
i'm really troubled by that .PERIOD but anyway that's - the basis of the thing that i want to share with you today ,COMMA though ,COMMA is that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later .PERIOD 
aviation week asked me to make a list of who i thought were the movers and shakers of the first <NUM> years of aviation .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA what happened when i was a little kid was - some pretty heavy stuff too .PERIOD 
and this was at a time when mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now .PERIOD we thought there'd be animals there ;SEMICOLON we knew there were plants there ;SEMICOLON the colors change ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
these two new airplanes are the same speed as the dc8 that was done in <NUM> .PERIOD 
here's the biggie ,COMMA and that is ,COMMA you don't have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it .PERIOD 
computers were used for artillery first ,COMMA then irs .PERIOD 
keep that in mind .PERIOD i put down innovation - i've looked for innovation cycles in space ;SEMICOLON i found none .PERIOD 
and i think i want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small company .PERIOD 
but i think once it does ,COMMA we will find solutions ,COMMA and very quickly ,COMMA you'll see those resort hotels in orbit .PERIOD 
there's a group of people that have come forward - and you don't know all of them - but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children ,COMMA this little three- to 15-year-old age ,COMMA by us going to orbit and going to the moon here ,COMMA right in this time period .PERIOD 
paul allen ,COMMA elan musk ,COMMA richard branson ,COMMA jeff bezos ,COMMA the ansari family ,COMMA which is now funding the russians' sub-orbital thing ,COMMA bob bigelow ,COMMA a private space station ,COMMA and carmack .PERIOD 
there were a couple of examples here .PERIOD 
and i'm talking about if you've got a baby now ,COMMA or if you've got a 10-year-old now .PERIOD 
relatively soon ,COMMA you'll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highest-performance military operational airplane .PERIOD it's never happened before .PERIOD 
you can fly with russian hardware .PERIOD this is available because a russian space program is starving ,COMMA and it's nice for them to get <NUM> million here and there to take one of the seats .PERIOD 
and every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by a factor of <NUM> to <NUM> .PERIOD and what that means is before we know it ,COMMA the progress in human space flight ,COMMA with no taxpayer dollars ,COMMA will be at a level of about five times as much as the current nasa budgets for human space flight .PERIOD 
and this realization is allowing us to reconceptualize the way that we actually approach these diseases by controlling angiogenesis .PERIOD 
now i'm going to focus on cancer because angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer ,COMMA every type of cancer .PERIOD 
this is a tumor :COLON dark ,COMMA gray ,COMMA ominous mass growing inside a brain .PERIOD 
dr. judah folkman ,COMMA who was my mentor and who was the pioneer of the angiogenesis field ,COMMA once called this cancer without disease .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA this late stage of cancer is the one at which it's most likely to be diagnosed ,COMMA when angiogenesis is already turned on and cancer cells are growing like wild .PERIOD 
we call this antiangiogenic therapy ,COMMA and it's completely different from chemotherapy because it selectively aims at the blood vessels that are feeding the cancers .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA i've just shown you two very different types of cancer that both responded to antiangiogenic therapy .PERIOD 
and we subsequently treated more than <NUM> dogs .PERIOD 
it had already spread to his lymph nodes ,COMMA so we used an antiangiogenic skin cream for the lip and an oral cocktail ,COMMA so we could treat from the inside as well as the outside .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA the first pioneering treatments for people ,COMMA as well as dogs ,COMMA are already becoming available .PERIOD 
but the real question is :COLON how well do these work in practice ?QUESTIONMARK 
so here's actually the patient survival data from eight different types of cancer .PERIOD 
but for other tumors and cancer types ,COMMA the improvements have only been modest .PERIOD 
and as a doctor ,COMMA i know that once a disease progresses to an advanced stage ,COMMA achieving a cure can be difficult ,COMMA if not impossible .PERIOD 
but i actually took a completely opposite approach and began asking :COLON what could we be adding to our diet that's naturally antiangiogenic ,COMMA that could boost the body's defense system and beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers ?QUESTIONMARK 
this inhibits abnormal angiogenesis by <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
and you can see clearly that the teas vary in their potency from less potent to more potent .PERIOD 
this means there's food synergy .PERIOD 
here's some more data from our testing .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA in the lab ,COMMA we can simulate tumor angiogenesis represented here in a black bar .PERIOD 
soy ,COMMA parsley ,COMMA garlic ,COMMA grapes ,COMMA berries ;SEMICOLON i could go home and cook a tasty meal using these ingredients .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA like a tumor ,COMMA fat grows when blood vessels grow .PERIOD 
albert szent-gyorgi once said that ,COMMA discovery consists of seeing what everyone has seen ,COMMA and thinking what no one has thought .PERIOD 
right .PERIOD and along those lines ,COMMA for people who might have risk factors for cancer ,COMMA would you recommend pursuing any treatments sort of prophylactically or simply pursuing the right diet with lots of tomato sauce ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA there's abundant epidemiological evidence .PERIOD 
i've designed puzzles for books ,COMMA printed things .PERIOD 
but at best they can reach for something more and create a memorable impression .PERIOD 
it's all figure .PERIOD 
not strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA if you could pick up the black vase ,COMMA it would look like the figure on top .PERIOD 
here ,COMMA let's make it a little harder .PERIOD still pretty easy .PERIOD 
i wanted to make a sequel .PERIOD 
garry trudeau calls himself an investigative cartoonist .PERIOD 
and i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA how on earth can you come up with a sequence of the base pairs in dna ?QUESTIONMARK 
and you have to choose pieces that overlap on the edge .PERIOD 
but it takes some persistence .PERIOD 
first of all ,COMMA you know ,COMMA for a long time computer games meant things like doom ,COMMA where you're going around shooting things ,COMMA very violent games ,COMMA very fast ,COMMA aimed at teenage boys .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK that's who plays computer games .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA guess what ?QUESTIONMARK that's changing .PERIOD 
and it's a game you play with other people .PERIOD 
a lot of people do sudoku .PERIOD in fact some doctors prescribe it .PERIOD 
anybody ?QUESTIONMARK 
what i want to talk about today is this particular cell ,COMMA or grouping of cells ,COMMA that is in each and every one of us .PERIOD 
i want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells is central to the evolution of our species and the continuation of the human race .PERIOD 
and i want you imagine that at some point in history a group of powerful people invested in owning and controlling the world understood that the suppression of this particular cell ,COMMA the oppression of these cells ,COMMA the reinterpretation of these cells ,COMMA the undermining of these cells ,COMMA getting us to believe in the weakness of these cells and the crushing ,COMMA eradicating ,COMMA destroying ,COMMA reducing these cells ,COMMA basically began the process of killing off the girl cell ,COMMA which was ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA patriarchy .PERIOD 
to be a leader means not to be a girl .PERIOD 
and i'd also like to say that the irony of course ,COMMA is that denying girl ,COMMA suppressing girl ,COMMA suppressing emotion ,COMMA refusing feeling has lead thus here .PERIOD 
where we have now come to live in a world where the most extreme forms of violence ,COMMA the most horrific poverty ,COMMA genocide ,COMMA mass rapes ,COMMA the destruction of the earth ,COMMA is completely out of control .PERIOD 
in the congo ,COMMA for those of you who don't know ,COMMA there has been a war raging for the last <NUM> years ,COMMA a war that has killed nearly six million people .PERIOD 
listening to the story of 80-year-old women who were tied to chains and circled ,COMMA and where groups of men would come and rape them periodically ,COMMA all in the name of economic exploitation to steal the minerals so the west can have it and profit from them .PERIOD 
that shattering ,COMMA that opening of my girl cell ,COMMA that kind of massive breakthrough of my heart allowed me to become more courageous ,COMMA and braver ,COMMA and actually more clever than i had been in the past in my life .PERIOD 
i want to change the verb .PERIOD 
i want the verb to be educate ,COMMA or activate ,COMMA or engage ,COMMA or confront ,COMMA or defy ,COMMA or create .PERIOD 
i know a 14-year-old girl in the netherlands ,COMMA for example ,COMMA who is demanding that she take a boat and go around the entire world by herself .PERIOD 
and i want to talk about a girl that i just met recently in bukavu ,COMMA who was impregnated by her rapist .PERIOD 
she taught girls what a healthy vagina looked like ,COMMA and what a mutilated vagina looked like .PERIOD 
and she said ,COMMA well ,COMMA now ,COMMA i need a house .PERIOD 
the whole community has bought in to what she's doing .PERIOD 
she imagined her father killing her on one hand ,COMMA and mama agnes greeting her ,COMMA with the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house .PERIOD 
i had the privilege of being in the hut when she was reunited with her father and reconciled .PERIOD 
in that hut ,COMMA we walked in ,COMMA and her father and his four wives were sitting there ,COMMA and her sisters who had just returned because they had all fled when she had fled ,COMMA and her primary mother ,COMMA who had been beaten in standing up for her with the elders .PERIOD 
and that is the power of transformation .PERIOD 
but i really want to do it for each and every person here ,COMMA to value the girl in us ,COMMA to value the part that cries ,COMMA to value the part that's emotional ,COMMA to value the part that's vulnerable ,COMMA to understand that's where the future lies .PERIOD 
i rejoice that it's still in my body .PERIOD 
i am an emotional creature .PERIOD 
i can take you back .PERIOD 
nothing's been diluted .PERIOD 
i love ,COMMA hear me ,COMMA i love that i can feel the feelings inside you ,COMMA even if they stop my life ,COMMA even if they break my heart ,COMMA even if they take me off track ,COMMA they make me responsible .PERIOD 
your body is covered with fractals .PERIOD 
let's see ,COMMA first iteration ,COMMA second ,COMMA third ,COMMA fourth .PERIOD 
so native americans use a combination of circular symmetry and fourfold symmetry .PERIOD 
it is not the same pattern at two different scales .PERIOD 
in some cases ,COMMA there would actually be algorithms ,COMMA and very sophisticated algorithms .PERIOD 
so i tracked down one of the folks who makes these things ,COMMA this guy in mali just outside of bamako ,COMMA and i asked him ,COMMA how come you're making fractal fences ?QUESTIONMARK because nobody else is .PERIOD 
so these guys are right on target for a practical use of scaling technology .PERIOD 
the most complex example of an algorithmic approach to fractals that i found was actually not in geometry ,COMMA it was in a symbolic code ,COMMA and this was bamana sand divination .PERIOD 
and finally ,COMMA out of desperation ,COMMA i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA let me explain georg cantor in <NUM> .PERIOD 
and then you take this symbol ,COMMA and you put it back in so it's a self-generating diversity of symbols .PERIOD 
and i know brian eno says there's not enough africa in computers ,COMMA but you know ,COMMA i don't think there's enough african history in brian eno .PERIOD 
we got a small seed grant ,COMMA just to see if folks would be willing to work with us on this ;SEMICOLON we're very excited about the future possibilities for that .PERIOD 
actually ,COMMA the reason that google was such a success is because they were the first ones to take advantage of the self-organizing properties of the web .PERIOD

♫ founding fathers all had slaves .PERIOD ♫ sweeney :COLON i know .PERIOD 
♫ lewis carroll i'm sure did alice .PERIOD ♫ sweeney :COLON what ?QUESTIONMARK 
anyway ,COMMA i like oprah - i like her girlfriendy-ness ,COMMA i like her weight issues ,COMMA i like how she's transformed talk television ,COMMA i like how she's brought reading back to america - but there was something that happened the last two weeks that was .PERIOD i call it the soon-yi moment :COLON it is the moment when i cannot continue supporting someone .PERIOD 
it makes what the bleep do we know seem like a doctoral dissertation from harvard on quantum mechanics - that's how bad it is .PERIOD 
i want to try to share just a little bit of that with you in this presentation .PERIOD 
the challenge ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is to answer this question :COLON what permits this extraordinary performance of animals that allows them basically to go anywhere ?QUESTIONMARK 
and if we could figure that out ,COMMA how can we implement those designs ?QUESTIONMARK 
think about it .PERIOD if you were an engineer and i told you that you had to build an automobile ,COMMA but it had to start off to be this big ,COMMA then it had to grow to be full size and had to work every step along the way .PERIOD 
or think about the fact that if you build an automobile ,COMMA i'll tell you that you also - inside it - have to put a factory that allows you to make another automobile .PERIOD 
they all produce the pattern of a pogo stick .PERIOD how is that true ?QUESTIONMARK 
we took their advice and we modeled the animals moving in the horizontal plane as well .PERIOD we took their three legs ,COMMA we collapsed them down as one .PERIOD 
it didn't decrease its preferred speed at all .PERIOD 
it has six legs - there are the tuned ,COMMA springy legs .PERIOD 
robert full :COLON it'll go on different surfaces - here's sand - although we haven't perfected the feet yet ,COMMA but i'll talk about that later .PERIOD 
like if we had a piece of tape now ,COMMA we'd peel it this way .PERIOD 
they do this with their toes .PERIOD it's bizarre !EXCLAMATIONMARK this peeling inspired irobot - that we work with - to build mecho-geckos .PERIOD 
and here's the peeling action of the mecho-gecko .PERIOD 
here's an individual hair with a little split end there .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA force is too low .PERIOD do they do it by electrostatics ?QUESTIONMARK 
and just recently we've made a breakthrough ,COMMA where we now believe we're going to be able to create the first synthetic ,COMMA self-cleaning ,COMMA dry adhesive .PERIOD many companies are interested in this .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
we proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong .PERIOD 
most people have cooking fires in the world ,COMMA whether it's camel dung or wood .PERIOD 
and the problem is this :COLON women are not making it to the top of any profession anywhere in the world .PERIOD 
we also have another problem ,COMMA which is that women face harder choices between professional success and personal fulfillment .PERIOD 
and i said ,COMMA are you telling me that i am the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year ?QUESTIONMARK 
in the high-income part of our workforce ,COMMA in the people who end up at the top - fortune <NUM> ceo jobs ,COMMA or the equivalent in other industries - the problem ,COMMA i am convinced ,COMMA is that women are dropping out .PERIOD 
this is hard .PERIOD i feel guilty sometimes .PERIOD 
my brother is kind of busy .PERIOD 
because what the data shows ,COMMA above all else ,COMMA is one thing ,COMMA which is that success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women .PERIOD 
this is the complication .PERIOD 
and that's a problem ,COMMA because we have to make it as important a job ,COMMA because it's the hardest job in the world to work inside the home ,COMMA for people of both genders ,COMMA if we're going to even things out and let women stay in the workforce .PERIOD 
message number three :COLON don't leave before you leave .PERIOD 
and literally from that moment ,COMMA she doesn't raise her hand anymore ,COMMA she doesn't look for a promotion ,COMMA she doesn't take on the new project ,COMMA she doesn't say ,COMMA me .PERIOD i want to do that .PERIOD 
my generation really ,COMMA sadly ,COMMA is not going to change the numbers at the top .PERIOD 
if you want to get at the big part - i mean from a public health level ,COMMA where my training is - you're looking at behavioral issues .PERIOD 
we talk about it in terms of engagement ,COMMA or non-compliance .PERIOD 
so the crux of it comes down to this notion of decision-making - giving information to people in a form that doesn't just educate them or inform them ,COMMA but actually leads them to make better decisions ,COMMA better choices in their lives .PERIOD 
so they asked them at the beginning ,COMMA do you think you'll actually be able to stick with this program ?QUESTIONMARK 
so fear showed up as not really the driver .PERIOD 
it was a notion that really came out of albert bandura's work ,COMMA who studied whether people could get a sense of empowerment .PERIOD 
it's an amazing notion .PERIOD 
and i had to explain ,COMMA they're trying to scare people .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA bandura recognized this years ago ,COMMA decades ago .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA i know where i sit .PERIOD i know where i'm situated .PERIOD 
and that doesn't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers - this overload of health information that we're inundated with .PERIOD 
finally ,COMMA we need to be presented with a clear point of action .PERIOD 
the choice in this case is pretty simple .PERIOD 
we either keep going fast ,COMMA or we slow down .PERIOD 
they reduce speeds by about five to <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
they last for about five miles ,COMMA in which case we put our foot back on the pedal .PERIOD 
and who among us would actually say that people who do try to read this actually get anything out of it ?QUESTIONMARK 
they went to the nutritional information box and saw that what works for cereal ,COMMA works for our food ,COMMA actually helps people understand what's in their food .PERIOD 
they're just not for us .PERIOD they're not for people .PERIOD they're not for patients .PERIOD 
this is the worst presented information .PERIOD 
and then we go a further step - we tell them what they can do .PERIOD 
so we take the bold step of putting the cholesterol information on the same page ,COMMA which is the way the doctor is going to evaluate it .PERIOD 
the last one i'll show you is a psa test .PERIOD 
and the only acceptable answer is - - yes .PERIOD 
okay .PERIOD on the other hand by placing your finger in a different position on the fingerboard it changes the string length ,COMMA that changes the frequency of the sound wave .PERIOD 
and now ,COMMA i realize that as the musician ,COMMA we human beings ,COMMA we have a great mind ,COMMA artistic heart and skill that can change the 16th-century technology and a legendary design to a wonderful entertainment .PERIOD 
but .PERIOD although some of them were quite up there for me .PERIOD 
and i realized we actually had quite a bit in common :COLON both of us were disseminating the genes of one species and not another ,COMMA and both of us - probably ,COMMA if i can imagine the bee's point of view - thought we were calling the shots .PERIOD 
we have a grammar that suggests that's who we are ;SEMICOLON that we are sovereign subjects in nature ,COMMA the bee as well as me .PERIOD 
and that's when i got the idea ,COMMA which was ,COMMA well ,COMMA what would happen if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who are working on us ?QUESTIONMARK 
and agriculture suddenly appeared to me not as an invention ,COMMA not as a human technology ,COMMA but as a co-evolutionary development in which a group of very clever species ,COMMA mostly edible grasses ,COMMA had exploited us ,COMMA figured out how to get us to basically deforest the world .PERIOD 
and suddenly everything looked different .PERIOD 
i'm a dupe .PERIOD i'm a dupe of the lawns ,COMMA whose goal in life is to outcompete the trees ,COMMA who they compete with for sunlight .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA let me go through what you gain when you look at the world this way ,COMMA besides some entertaining insights about human desire .PERIOD 
as an intellectual matter ,COMMA looking at the world from other species' points of view helps us deal with this weird anomaly ,COMMA which is - and this is in the realm of intellectual history - which is that we have this darwinian revolution <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
this is a farm in the shenandoah valley of virginia .PERIOD 
the idea is he's got six different species of animals ,COMMA as well as some plants ,COMMA growing in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement .PERIOD 
and i'll show you ,COMMA if you take this approach ,COMMA what you get ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA one day ,COMMA cattle in a pen .PERIOD 
the eggmobile is a very rickety contraption - it looks like a prairie schooner made out of boards - but it houses <NUM> chickens .PERIOD 
so the chickens do their kind of little breakdance and they're pushing around the manure to get at the grubs ,COMMA and in the process they're spreading the manure out .PERIOD 
and within four or five weeks ,COMMA he can do it again .PERIOD 
put that in play .PERIOD 
so when they lose a lot of leaf mass ,COMMA they shed roots ;SEMICOLON they kind of cauterize them and the roots die .PERIOD 
and they're labeled by color right now ,COMMA by language .PERIOD 
but you can also see ,COMMA there are places where there's not so much .PERIOD 
but it didn't have quite the same pickup in the u.s .PERIOD 
and so i guess the u.s. finally ,COMMA finally started to like it ,COMMA too .PERIOD 
and it's something i'm very excited to be a part of .PERIOD 
but it was a dream of his ,COMMA and we ,COMMA basically ,COMMA when people really want to do something ,COMMA well ,COMMA we generally let them .PERIOD 
you can see ,COMMA even though the u.s. is still the majority here - though ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA search-wise ,COMMA it's only about <NUM> percent of our traffic - but it's already going to japan ,COMMA and the u.k. and europe ,COMMA and all the rest of the countries .PERIOD 
and - well ,COMMA i'll leave you in suspense .PERIOD 
so one of the things - both sergey and i went to a montessori school ,COMMA and i think ,COMMA for some reason ,COMMA this has been incorporated in google .PERIOD 
and sergey mentioned orkut ,COMMA which is something that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA orkut wanted to do in his time ,COMMA and we call this - at google ,COMMA we've embodied this as the <NUM> percent time ,COMMA and the idea is ,COMMA for <NUM> percent of your time ,COMMA if you're working at google ,COMMA you can do what you think is the best thing to do .PERIOD 
and this was kind of a surprise to me ,COMMA but we found that as long as you keep the <NUM> things in your head ,COMMA which you did by writing them down ,COMMA that you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do and where to put your resources .PERIOD 
so this is a new - how many of you use the google toolbar ?QUESTIONMARK 
and the nice thing about this ,COMMA we have a self-serve program ,COMMA and many thousands of websites have signed up ,COMMA and this let's them really make money .PERIOD and i - you know ,COMMA there's a number of people i met - i met this guy who runs a conservation site at a party ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i wasn't making any money .PERIOD 
and so there is this blog of a young person who was kind of depressed ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i'm sleeping a lot .PERIOD 
and i think we're really lucky to have that kind of business model because everyone in the world has access to our search ,COMMA and i think that's a tremendous ,COMMA tremendous benefit .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i'm also fairly determined to try and build a game layer on top of the world .PERIOD 
it's not very good .PERIOD it's cluttered .PERIOD 
if you're not ,COMMA too bad .PERIOD there's nothing you can do .PERIOD 
it's actually about using dynamics ,COMMA using forces ,COMMA to influence the behavior of where you are ,COMMA what you do there ,COMMA how you do it .PERIOD 
come here at a certain time ,COMMA get your drinks half off .PERIOD 
this game dynamic is so powerful that it doesn't just influence our behavior ,COMMA it's influenced our entire culture .PERIOD 
they will return like clockwork at different times .PERIOD 
modern warfare ,COMMA one of the most successful selling games of all time .PERIOD 
it's also used in more conventional settings and can be used more consciously in conventional settings .PERIOD 
school - and remember ,COMMA i made it through one year ,COMMA so i think i'm qualified to talk on school - is a game ,COMMA it's just not a terribly well-designed game ,COMMA right .PERIOD 
there are statuses .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA what is valedictorian ,COMMA but a status ?QUESTIONMARK 
that sucks .PERIOD why not level-up ?QUESTIONMARK 
and it's very powerful .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA you see this is a paladin level <NUM> ,COMMA and that's a paladin level <NUM> ,COMMA and if you were going to fight ,COMMA you know ,COMMA orcs on the fields of mordor against the raz al ghul ,COMMA you'd probably want to be the bigger one ,COMMA right .PERIOD 
their most dedicated players ,COMMA it's like a full-time job .PERIOD 
and we've introduced a progression dynamic into it ,COMMA where ,COMMA by going to the same place over and over ,COMMA by doing challenges ,COMMA by engaging with the business ,COMMA you move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right edge of the screen ,COMMA and you eventually unlock rewards .PERIOD 
so we have to use this one carefully .PERIOD 
it's a woodworking machine ,COMMA or at least a piece of one ,COMMA and my task was to make this thing a little bit more modern ,COMMA a little bit easier to use .PERIOD 
now this gentleman ,COMMA isambard kingdom brunel ,COMMA designed many great things in his career in the <NUM> century ,COMMA including the clifton suspension bridge in bristol and the thames tunnel at rotherhithe .PERIOD 
his greatest creation runs actually right through here in oxford .PERIOD 
he imagined an integrated transportation system in which it would be possible for a passenger to embark on a train in london and disembark from a ship in new york .PERIOD 
and i'd like to talk about some of those just for the next few minutes .PERIOD 
so it took a team working in india with patients and community health workers to understand how a pda and an application on a pda might replace those technicians in a fitting and diagnostic service .PERIOD 
and the faster we do that ,COMMA the faster our ideas evolve .PERIOD 
this is the manufacturing facility for one of their biggest cost breakthroughs .PERIOD 
they went from retreating to the nurse's station to discuss the various states and needs of patients ,COMMA to developing a system that happened on the ward in front of patients ,COMMA using a simple software tool .PERIOD 
and this is just one of thousands of opportunities in healthcare alone .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA again ,COMMA we are in the midst of massive change .PERIOD 
how might we improve access to safe drinking water for the world's poorest people ,COMMA and at the same time stimulate innovation amongst local water providers ?QUESTIONMARK 
what kinds of questions do we think design thinking could be used to tackle ?QUESTIONMARK 
there is a hash tag there that you can use ,COMMA # cbdq .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA since i couldn't have my tea the way i wanted it ,COMMA i ordered a cup of coffee ,COMMA which the waiter brought over promptly .PERIOD 
but from the japanese perspective ,COMMA it's their duty to protect those who don't know any better - in this case ,COMMA the ignorant gaijin - from making the wrong choice .PERIOD 
as i do so ,COMMA i hope you'll start thinking about some of your own assumptions and how they were shaped by your backgrounds .PERIOD 
it is essential for success .PERIOD 
the kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do ,COMMA and they even got to choose which marker they would write their answers with .PERIOD 
in reality ,COMMA the kids who were told what to do ,COMMA whether by miss smith or their mothers ,COMMA were actually given the very same activity ,COMMA which their counterparts in the first group had freely chosen .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA some of the kids were visibly embarrassed when they were told that their mothers had been consulted .PERIOD 
the first-generation children were strongly influenced by their immigrant parents' approach to choice .PERIOD 
or ,COMMA you could say that the individual's preferences were shaped by the preferences of specific others .PERIOD 
americans train their whole lives to play spot the difference .PERIOD 
a number of my studies have shown that when you give people <NUM> or more options when they're making a choice ,COMMA they make poorer decisions ,COMMA whether it be health care ,COMMA investment ,COMMA other critical areas .PERIOD 
they'd already picked out a name for her ,COMMA barbara ,COMMA after her grandmother .PERIOD 
unable to breathe on her own ,COMMA she was put on a ventilator .PERIOD 
this narrative promises so much :COLON freedom ,COMMA happiness ,COMMA success .PERIOD 
instead of replacing one story with another ,COMMA we can learn from and revel in the many versions that exist and the many that have yet to be written .PERIOD 
no matter where we're from and what your narrative is ,COMMA we all have a responsibility to open ourselves up to a wider array of what choice can do ,COMMA and what it can represent .PERIOD 
it brings us that much closer to realizing the full potential of choice ,COMMA to inspiring the hope and achieving the freedom that choice promises but doesn't always deliver .PERIOD 
so i brought these two bottles of nail polish into the laboratory ,COMMA and i stripped the labels off .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA good morning .PERIOD 
and it's not just what these are doing to each other ,COMMA but it's what the audience thinks that really frames this matter .PERIOD 
to get a sense of this ,COMMA and it's been a theme we've talked about all week ,COMMA i recently talked to a bunch of tweeners .PERIOD 
girl <NUM> :COLON because they're going to lose all their money eventually .PERIOD 
doesn't work out too well for them ,COMMA they lose money .PERIOD 
the rocket's position is shown by the trajectory that we're now looking at .PERIOD 
and as it reaches the peak of its trajectory ,COMMA the velocity ,COMMA you will notice ,COMMA has dropped off to a minimum .PERIOD 
but like ,COMMA let's imagine we took the latest pentium processor ,COMMA the latest core <NUM> extreme ,COMMA which is a four-core processor that intel's working on ,COMMA it will be our laptop tomorrow .PERIOD 
so - and we haven't even worked out the cooling needs .PERIOD 
every effort has been made and will continue to be made to find a new pattern ,COMMA new selling arrangements and new types of programs that may arrest the declining revenues .PERIOD 
it may yet be possible to eke out a poor existence for radio ,COMMA but i don't know how .PERIOD 
it was the dawn of interactive tv ,COMMA and you may have noticed they wanted to sell you the winky dink kits .PERIOD 
pete ,COMMA i could use any ordinary open-source crayon ,COMMA why do i have to buy theirs ?QUESTIONMARK 
but we will discuss this scandal ,COMMA because this man ,COMMA jack berry ,COMMA the host of winky dink ,COMMA went on to become the host of twenty one ,COMMA one of the most important quiz shows ever .PERIOD 
we'll talk a little bit more about him later .PERIOD 
it's the era of big business and data centers for computing .PERIOD 
it all happened within five miles of where i'm standing ,COMMA at stanford university ,COMMA between <NUM> and <NUM> .PERIOD 
hypercard was the first program to introduce the public to hyperlinks ,COMMA where you could randomly hook to any kind of picture ,COMMA or piece of text ,COMMA or data across a file system ,COMMA and we had no way of explaining it .PERIOD 
once it was only a dream of technoids and a few long-forgotten politicians .PERIOD 
and further stimulus came with the deregulation of the cable television industry ,COMMA and the re-regulation of the cable television industry .PERIOD 
voice <NUM> :COLON next on the gourmet pet channel ,COMMA decorating birthday cakes for your schnauzer .PERIOD 
we come into the era of the dotcom ,COMMA the world wide web ,COMMA and i don't need to tell you about that because we all went through that bubble together .PERIOD 
voice <NUM> :COLON you'll have to stay here in the safe house until we get word the terrorist threat is over .PERIOD 
and media companies realize the audience is important also .PERIOD 
and i think this is beginning to happen in the entertainment business .PERIOD 
they think of the old medium ,COMMA because the old medium is always the content of the new medium ,COMMA as movies tend to be the content of tv ,COMMA and as books used to be the content ,COMMA novels used to be the content of movies .PERIOD 
and i used three criteria :COLON the first was ,COMMA i thought i'd talk about real design within reach ,COMMA design that's free ,COMMA not design not quite within reach ,COMMA as we're fondly known by our competition and competitors ,COMMA but stuff that you can find on the streets ,COMMA stuff that was free ,COMMA stuff that was available to all people ,COMMA and stuff that probably contains some other important messages .PERIOD 
wholly inconsistent with san francisco or new york .PERIOD 
how did i get started in this business ?QUESTIONMARK 
in italy ,COMMA you know ,COMMA almost everything ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA looks good .PERIOD 
i've come across some other just ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA curious relationships of bollards on the street that have different interpretations ,COMMA but - these things amuse me .PERIOD 
and i came down one day ,COMMA and all the bikes were red .PERIOD 
and at that moment ,COMMA the sun came out ,COMMA and through this perforated screen ,COMMA a pattern was cast over these bodies and they kind of faded into the rear ,COMMA and we left the restaurant kind of feeling o.k .PERIOD about stuff .PERIOD 
cities are the place where we're most likely to encounter diversity and to mix with other people .PERIOD 
and it's a welcoming area ,COMMA i think ,COMMA inclusive of diversity ,COMMA reflective of diversity ,COMMA and i think this marriage of both technology and art in the public sector is an area where the u.s .PERIOD 
and i decided i had to get closer than just drawing fantasy airplanes .PERIOD 
you had to learn what made an airplane stay in the air .PERIOD 
i had to learn mathematics and mechanics and all this sort of thing .PERIOD 
so i chose furniture .PERIOD 
and i chose chairs specifically because i knew something about them .PERIOD 
there are drawbacks to this .PERIOD 
one is :COLON you can't accommodate everybody .PERIOD 
so he said ,COMMA well i'll come over and look at it .PERIOD 
so here we are .PERIOD 
so if you watch this chair as i recline ,COMMA the headrest comes up to meet my neck .PERIOD 
you cant hit your elbow on bottom .PERIOD 
what does that mean ,COMMA my environment ?QUESTIONMARK 
and you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places .PERIOD 
you spend it at rest and you spend it at work .PERIOD 
so then i decided to leave that part of the world ,COMMA and i was going to go to the mid-west .PERIOD 
very nice ,COMMA and there my older ,COMMA senior lungs ,COMMA as i like to call them ,COMMA i filled with particulate matter ,COMMA carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone .PERIOD 
okay ?QUESTIONMARK almost like the highest in the nation .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what's wrong with this picture ?QUESTIONMARK 
they haven't asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that i put in my mouth or the food that i ingest into my stomach .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i've circled the places where i've been .PERIOD 
oh ,COMMA not so lucky .PERIOD 
they give us some sense of what's going to be our train wreck .PERIOD 
and all of those black dots are all of the toxic release inventories that are monitored by the epa .PERIOD 
this is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room instead of just the pink slip that said i paid at the counter .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i believe that geographic information can make both you and me very healthy .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD 
so .PERIOD 
they take you to gruff-ex-cop-on-his-fourth-marriage.dad .PERIOD 
i'd be like some kind of internet genius ,COMMA and me ,COMMA i'd like to upgrade to deity and maybe just like that - pop !EXCLAMATIONMARK - i'd go wireless .PERIOD 
you don't say a prayer .PERIOD 
thank you ,COMMA ted .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA for roughly <NUM> years ,COMMA the hot debate in architecture was whether the number five or the number seven was a better proportion to think about architecture ,COMMA because the nose was one-fifth of your head ,COMMA or because your head was one-seventh of your body .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA whenever you lost information ,COMMA you'd move to symmetry ;SEMICOLON whenever you added information to a system ,COMMA you would break symmetry .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the only way we could design that ,COMMA or possibly construct it ,COMMA is by using a calculus-based definition of the form .PERIOD 
it also is much more dynamic ,COMMA so that you can see that the same form opens and closes in a very dynamic way as you move across it ,COMMA because it has this quality of vector in motion built into it .PERIOD 
you just need to incorporate a certain number of traits in a very kind of genetic way .PERIOD 
i won't go into too much description of any of these projects ,COMMA but what you can see is that the escalators and elevators that circulate people along the face of the building are all held up by <NUM> structural trusses .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA working with bentley and microstation ,COMMA we've written a custom piece of software that networks all of the components together into these chunks of information ,COMMA so that if we change any element along the length of the building ,COMMA not only does that change distribute through each one of the trusses ,COMMA but each one of the trusses then distributes that information down the length of the entire facade of the building .PERIOD 
but what it gives us is a harmonic and synthesized relationship of all these components ,COMMA one to another .PERIOD 
at the same time ,COMMA there's a person paying <NUM> dollars for a 300-series car ,COMMA and a person paying <NUM> dollars for a <NUM> series ,COMMA and that person paying more than double doesn't want their car to look too much like the bottom-of-the-market car .PERIOD 
so they have to also discriminate between these products .PERIOD 
to go back to architecture ,COMMA what's organic about architecture as a field ,COMMA unlike product design ,COMMA is this whole issue of holism and of monumentality is really our realm .PERIOD 
and to do that ,COMMA we tried to connect up the five towers into a single system .PERIOD 
with united architects ,COMMA also ,COMMA we made a proposal for the european central bank headquarters that used the same system ,COMMA but this time in a much more monolithic mass ,COMMA like a sphere .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA for these interiors ,COMMA like this shop in stockholm ,COMMA sweden ,COMMA or this installation wall in the netherlands at the netherlands architecture institute ,COMMA we could use the texture that the tool would leave to produce a lot of the spatial effects ,COMMA and we could integrate the texture of the wall with the form of the wall with the material .PERIOD 
what i'd like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter ,COMMA and actually all the way down into the sewer because i want to talk about diarrhea .PERIOD 
and in particular ,COMMA i want to talk about the design of diarrhea .PERIOD 
if instead transmission to another host requires host mobility ,COMMA then we expect that the winners of the competition will be the milder organisms .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA one way you can test is just look at all diarrheal bacteria ,COMMA and see whether or not the ones that tend to be more transmitted by water ,COMMA tend to be more harmful .PERIOD 
after a few days of infection you end up having - the fecal material really isn't so disgusting as we might imagine .PERIOD 
and if you took a drop of that water ,COMMA you might find a million diarrheal organisms .PERIOD 
if it didn't produce a lot of this toxin ,COMMA then you might find a smaller number .PERIOD 
so the task is to try to figure out how to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this to evolve towards mildness by blocking waterborne transmission ,COMMA thereby allowing the organism only to be transmitted by person-to-person contact ,COMMA or person-food-person contact - both of which would really require that people be mobile and fairly healthy for transmission .PERIOD 
one would be to take a lot of different strains of this organism - some that produce a lot of toxins ,COMMA some that produce a little - and take those strains and spew them out in different countries .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we don't want to run an experiment like that .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i don't know how that happened ,COMMA and i didn't have anything to do with it ,COMMA i promise you .PERIOD 
the goal is to turn this around .PERIOD 
if you could cause an evolutionary decrease in virulence by cleaning up the water supply ,COMMA you should be able to get an evolutionary decrease in antibiotic resistance .PERIOD 
and i want to give you just one more example ,COMMA because we've talked a little bit about malaria .PERIOD 
in the case of malaria ,COMMA what we'd like to do is mosquito-proof houses .PERIOD 
the only pathogens that get transmitted are the ones that are infecting people that feel healthy enough to walk outside and get mosquito bites .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i don't really have time to talk about those things ,COMMA but i did want to put them up there ,COMMA just to give you a sense that there really are solutions to controlling the evolution of harmfulness of some of the nasty pathogens that we're confronted with .PERIOD 
and the data really do support this :COLON that you actually do get the virus evolving towards mildness .PERIOD 
anyhow ,COMMA i'll end that there ,COMMA and thank you very much .PERIOD 
our hands are amazing instruments .PERIOD 
and when they're missing ,COMMA it's a barrier .PERIOD 
every time you contract a muscle ,COMMA it emits a little electricity that you can record with antennae or electrodes and use that to operate the motorized prosthesis .PERIOD 
well the body works by starting a motor command in your brain ,COMMA going down your spinal cord ,COMMA out the nerves and to your periphery .PERIOD 
and we take the nerve away from your chest muscle and let these nerves grow into it .PERIOD 
now you think ,COMMA close hand ,COMMA and a little section of your chest contracts .PERIOD 
and jesse's a good crane operator ,COMMA and he did okay by our standards .PERIOD 
so this is really exciting for us ,COMMA because now we have a portal ,COMMA a portal ,COMMA or a way to potentially give back sensation ,COMMA so that he might feel what he touches with his prosthetic hand .PERIOD 
we've also gone on with what was initially our primary population of people with above-the-elbow amputations .PERIOD 
you had to concentrate a whole lot .PERIOD 
then we fit her with a prosthesis .PERIOD 
a little faster .PERIOD and much more easy ,COMMA much more natural .PERIOD 
there's a lot of information in those nerve signals ,COMMA and we wanted to get more .PERIOD 
and here you can see ,COMMA on jesse's chest ,COMMA when he just tried to do three different things ,COMMA you can see three different patterns .PERIOD 
obviously ,COMMA that's heavy for amanda .PERIOD 
it took just about probably three to four hours to get it to train .PERIOD 
so we're really excited ,COMMA because now we're getting to a clinically practical device .PERIOD 
i want you to watch closely .PERIOD 
that's claudia ,COMMA and that was the first time she got to feel sensation through her prosthetic .PERIOD 
once we can do it that small ,COMMA it's a lot easier making them bigger .PERIOD 
so amanda came jet-lagged ,COMMA she's using the arm ,COMMA and everything goes wrong .PERIOD 
and none of those problems could i have dealt with ,COMMA but i have a really bright research team .PERIOD 
but first ,COMMA i want to start by saying that we need a new operating system ,COMMA for the oceans and for the earth .PERIOD 
because we've only doubled the population of the earth since the <NUM> - a little more than doubled - but we have <NUM> billion people in the world ,COMMA and we all like to consume .PERIOD 
humans ,COMMA without fins :COLON <NUM> meters ,COMMA <NUM> minutes .PERIOD 
so penguins are amazing athletes .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA more importantly ,COMMA they're well-dressed .PERIOD 
if you go and do it now ,COMMA the national parks count about <NUM> .PERIOD 
so we have a quarter of the penguins that we did <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
when we have extreme el nino events ,COMMA you see all this red ,COMMA and you see no green out here around the galapagos .PERIOD 
things die when there's no food .PERIOD 
and if you look along the coast of argentina ,COMMA where i work now ,COMMA at a place called punta tombo - the largest magellanic penguin colony in the world down here about <NUM> degrees south latitude - you see that there's great variation here .PERIOD 
and so we have started a global penguin society to try to focus on the real plight of penguins .PERIOD 
they ended up swimming through ballast water that had oil in it .PERIOD 
so we ended up spending nine years convincing the government that there were lots of oiled penguins .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA of course ,COMMA all of this then leads to a vicious cycle and you can't raise a lot of chicks .PERIOD 
turbo has taken to knocking on the door with his beak ,COMMA we let him in and he comes in here .PERIOD 
so this is turbo .PERIOD 
and now he's looking at the other guy ,COMMA saying ,COMMA you are really weird .PERIOD 
most important thing is :COLON only you can change yourself ,COMMA and only you can change the world and make it better ,COMMA for people as well as penguins .PERIOD 
but let's talk about the <NUM> percent of the world population that will never leave the place in which they were born .PERIOD 
over <NUM> new countries were born .PERIOD 
and they share a lengthy land border .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA the world bank predicts that russia's population is declining towards about <NUM> million people and there is another thing that you don't see on this map .PERIOD 
stalin ,COMMA khrushchev and other soviet leaders forced russians out to the far east to be in gulags ,COMMA labor camps ,COMMA nuclear cities ,COMMA whatever the case was .PERIOD 
as a result ,COMMA in the russian far east today ,COMMA which is twice the size of india ,COMMA you have exactly six million russians .PERIOD 
because globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to undermine and change the way we think about political geography .PERIOD 
remember the <NUM> dots on the nighttime map that show the hubs of the global economy ?QUESTIONMARK 
and now many of you have been reading in the news how people are looking to china to lead the rebound ,COMMA the economic rebound ,COMMA not just in asia ,COMMA but potentially for the world .PERIOD 
so china is becoming the anchor of the economy in the region .PERIOD 
china has signed military agreements with many countries in the region .PERIOD 
all of this is happening without firing a shot .PERIOD 
so what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world ?QUESTIONMARK 
what i want to present to you is what i call state building ,COMMA day by day .PERIOD 
the kurds for <NUM> years have been waging a struggle for independence ,COMMA and now is their chance to finally have it .PERIOD 
now remember kurdistan is landlocked .PERIOD 
and therefore it has to have amicable relations with them .PERIOD 
the lesson from kurdistan and from palestine is that independence alone ,COMMA without infrastructure ,COMMA is futile .PERIOD 
the last time that was the case was actually a century ago ,COMMA during the ottoman empire .PERIOD 
but today the hejaz railway lies in tatters ,COMMA ruins .PERIOD 
more pipelines means more silk roads ,COMMA instead of the great game .PERIOD 
in <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> new countries joined the e.u .PERIOD 
even if these regions aren't part of the e.u .PERIOD they are becoming part of its sphere of influence .PERIOD 
so what's next ?QUESTIONMARK where are we going to see borders change and new countries born ?QUESTIONMARK 
if we were to look at all of africa we could most certainly acknowledge far more ,COMMA tribal divisions and so forth .PERIOD 
it has three ongoing civil wars ,COMMA the genocide in darfur ,COMMA which you all know about ,COMMA the civil war in the east of the country ,COMMA and south sudan .PERIOD 
but if you look in nature ,COMMA you see that different kinds of animals can have really different lifespans .PERIOD 
now these animals are different from one another ,COMMA because they have different genes .PERIOD 
and we didn't study any of these animals .PERIOD 
is it miserable ?QUESTIONMARK it doesn't seem to be .PERIOD 
and if you look at the tissues of the animal ,COMMA they're starting to deteriorate .PERIOD 
and now here is the daf-2 mutant .PERIOD 
but it's really more like this :COLON let's say you're a <NUM> year-old guy - or in your <NUM> - and you're a bachelor and you're dating people .PERIOD 
she says ,COMMA i'm <NUM> .PERIOD 
well as you know ,COMMA genes ,COMMA which are part of the dna ,COMMA they're instructions to make a protein that does something .PERIOD 
it says that aging is subject to control by the genes ,COMMA and specifically by hormones .PERIOD 
so after we made our discoveries with little c. elegans ,COMMA people who worked on other kinds of animals started asking ,COMMA if we made the same daf-2 mutation ,COMMA the hormone receptor mutation ,COMMA in other animals ,COMMA will they live longer ?QUESTIONMARK 
they hardly get cancer ,COMMA and when they do it's not as severe .PERIOD 
so in a daf-2 mutant - you see that i have the x drawn here through the receptor .PERIOD 
the receptor isn't working as well .PERIOD 
and many of these different genes ,COMMA we've shown ,COMMA actually contribute to the long lifespan of the daf-2 mutant .PERIOD 
then they promote the uptake of nutrients .PERIOD 
so he doesn't actually do anything himself .PERIOD 
we don't know the details of how this works ,COMMA but we do know then that foxo genes can impact the lifespan of people .PERIOD 
but in this case ,COMMA there's already a drug called rapamycin that binds to the tor protein and inhibits its activity .PERIOD 
so people take it to prevent organ transplants from being rejected .PERIOD 
you could change the genes in principle .PERIOD 
so it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully to get the benefits without getting any problems .PERIOD 
i wasn't suggesting that i was going to go and do it ,COMMA but .PERIOD 
just move to one side for us ,COMMA if you would .PERIOD 
and when you look at these <NUM> year-old turtles ,COMMA you can't tell the difference ,COMMA just by looking ,COMMA between those turtles and <NUM> year-old turtles .PERIOD 
they're more resistant to these kinds of stresses .PERIOD 
they're not getting old in the dog's lifespan .PERIOD 
here's another good article about a new campaign opposing privatization of transit without any contact information for the campaign .PERIOD 
the message seems to be that the readers are most likely to want to eat ,COMMA maybe read a book ,COMMA maybe see a movie ,COMMA but not be engaged in their community .PERIOD 
they all have heroes who were chosen .PERIOD 
this helps me understand why a lot of people have trouble seeing themselves as leaders because it sends all the wrong messages about what leadership is about .PERIOD 
as long as we're teaching our kids that heroism starts when someone scratches a mark on your forehead ,COMMA or someone tells you that you're part of a prophecy ,COMMA they're missing the most important characteristic of leadership ,COMMA which is that it comes from within .PERIOD 
which leads us to the last one ,COMMA which is our elections .PERIOD 
so i was privileged to train in transplantation under two great surgical pioneers :COLON thomas starzl ,COMMA who performed the world's first successful liver transplant in <NUM> ,COMMA and sir roy calne ,COMMA who performed the first liver transplant in the u.k .PERIOD 
in the following year .PERIOD 
but not all patients on the transplant wait list are so fortunate .PERIOD 
and the gift of life has been extended from brain-dead donors to living ,COMMA related donors - relatives who might donate an organ or a part of an organ ,COMMA like a split liver graft ,COMMA to a relative or loved one .PERIOD 
no doubt ,COMMA i was informed ,COMMA the consent had been obtained .PERIOD 
and at that time ,COMMA stem cell research had gained momentum ,COMMA following the isolation of the world's first human embryonic stem cells in the <NUM> .PERIOD 
and as it turns out ,COMMA fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells .PERIOD 
if this research is successful ,COMMA it may then reduce the need to research and sacrifice human embryos .PERIOD 
it is a fact that when our organs or tissues are injured ,COMMA our bone marrow releases stem cells into our circulation .PERIOD 
there are <NUM> clinical trials investigating the role of stem cells in heart disease .PERIOD 
we are very happy because we have the opportunity to have this angel in the world - not only in our country ,COMMA venezuela ,COMMA but in our world .PERIOD 
he has given us the possibility to have dreams and to make true the dreams .PERIOD 
and here are the results of this wonderful project that is the system in venezuela .PERIOD 
he buys a ring ,COMMA she buys a dress .PERIOD 
these optimistic young bastards promise to honor and cherish each other through hot flashes and mid-life crises and a cumulative 50-lb .PERIOD weight gain ,COMMA until that far-off day when one of them is finally able to rest in peace .PERIOD 
and some of them will even still be enjoying each others' company when neither of them can chew solid food anymore .PERIOD 
what do the folks who make it all the way to side-by-side burial plots have in common ?QUESTIONMARK 
and they try to pinpoint what it is that sets them apart from their miserable neighbors and friends .PERIOD 
it's obvious that this leads to marital bliss because ,COMMA women ,COMMA we care a great deal about being thin and good looking ,COMMA whereas men mostly care about sex .PERIOD 
so instead of all that laborious dieting and exercising ,COMMA we just need to wait for them to get fat ,COMMA maybe bake a few pies .PERIOD 
these are couples who can find good in any situation .PERIOD 
this is an actual study ,COMMA and let me clarify .PERIOD 
now i don't know how old all of you are ,COMMA but when i was a kid ,COMMA your parents took pictures with a special kind of camera that held something called film ,COMMA and ,COMMA by god ,COMMA film was expensive .PERIOD 
i'm serious .PERIOD 
so i'm obviously going to need fatten him up .PERIOD 
i have a doppelganger .PERIOD 
that's exactly what i do - optical mind control .PERIOD 
even if we could measure what every cell is doing at all times ,COMMA we would still have to make sense of the recorded activity patterns ,COMMA and that's so difficult ,COMMA chances are we'll understand these patterns just as little as the brains that produce them .PERIOD 
to make progress ,COMMA we need to break the code .PERIOD 
the approach works so well that we can write purely artificial messages directly to the brain .PERIOD 
these headless bodies can live for about a day ,COMMA but they don't do much .PERIOD 
now for an intelligent being like our fly ,COMMA this policy is not written in stone but rather changes as the animal learns from experience .PERIOD 
so we bred flies whose brains were more or less randomly peppered with cells that were light addressable .PERIOD 
whenever it comes up to the midpoint ,COMMA it pauses ,COMMA it carefully scans the odor interface as if it was sniffing out its environment ,COMMA and then it turns around .PERIOD 
these <NUM> cells ,COMMA as shown here in green ,COMMA send the output to a brain structure called the mushroom body ,COMMA which is shown here in gray .PERIOD 
if the connection is strong ,COMMA the motors will turn on and the fly will initiate a turn .PERIOD 
in a situation like this ,COMMA we would expect the critic to speak up and to tell the actor to change its policy .PERIOD 
so the next time the fly finds itself facing the same odor again ,COMMA the connection is strong enough to turn on the motors and to trigger an evasive maneuver .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA in terms of biomimetics ,COMMA as human technologies take on more of the characteristics of nature ,COMMA nature becomes a much more useful teacher .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA being a biologist ,COMMA i was very curious about this .PERIOD 
these are gecko toes .PERIOD 
and the individual has <NUM> billion of these nano-size split ends .PERIOD 
so what they did was they asked us an important question .PERIOD 
they're climbing up a wall ,COMMA or a tree .PERIOD 
now that's real time .PERIOD you can't see anything .PERIOD 
so they do it with this active tail as they swing around .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA there it goes .PERIOD 
it oscillates its tail up and down like a dolphin .PERIOD 
but watch its front legs .PERIOD can you see what they are doing ?QUESTIONMARK 
so now we were really confused ,COMMA because there are no reports of it gliding .PERIOD 
one of the problems is coming up with the right target .PERIOD 
there's not a lot of science behind that one either .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA why is this so complicated ?QUESTIONMARK 
volcanoes eject aerosols into the atmosphere .PERIOD 
so here's the thing .PERIOD it sounds like a simple question .PERIOD 
that's the ross sea ice shelf on the right there .PERIOD 
you can go then and study corals and figure out how often do you see this .PERIOD 
and it been growing for about <NUM> years .PERIOD 
you can see some of the coral cores there on the right .PERIOD 
that the place where ,COMMA during an earthquake in <NUM> ,COMMA this marine terrace was lifted up out of the ocean very quickly ,COMMA and it was lifted up about six to seven meters .PERIOD 
and so now you can walk through a coral reef without getting wet .PERIOD 
there's a whole family of curves here .PERIOD 
some of the records show lower temperatures than others .PERIOD 
and there is natural variability caused by the sun ,COMMA caused by el ninos .PERIOD 
there's consequences for carbonate organisms .PERIOD 
the main framework material of coral reefs is calcium carbonate .PERIOD 
and on coral reefs ,COMMA where some of the main framework organisms disappear ,COMMA we will see a major loss of marine biodiversity .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA these are things that we have good physiological reasons to expect to see stressed caused by this transience .PERIOD 
you have to go back about <NUM> million years to find a time when co2 levels were double what they are today .PERIOD 
that's the reason that they're not able to respond or adapt to this rapid acidification that's going on right now .PERIOD 
and i think that may very well be true ,COMMA so i'll close with this .PERIOD 
and a long time ago - well ,COMMA about <NUM> years ago - my mom had an exchange student .PERIOD 
this is donna at the statue of liberty .PERIOD 
but i'd like to talk about another way to travel that doesn't require a ship or an airplane ,COMMA and just requires a movie camera ,COMMA a projector and a screen .PERIOD 
and that's what i'm going to talk to you about today .PERIOD 
so i'm the living product of two cultures coming together .PERIOD 
to change the arab nightmare into the american dream .PERIOD 
josh rushing :COLON the night they showed the pows and the dead soldiers - al jazeera showed them - it was powerful because america doesn't show those kinds of images .PERIOD 
and it upset me on a profound level that i wasn't bothered as much the night before .PERIOD 
jehane noujaim :COLON i was overwhelmed by the response of the film ,COMMA for we didn't know whether it would be able to get out there .PERIOD 
and i saw this with audiences .PERIOD 
man :COLON god forbid !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
if you were not abu azzam's daughter .PERIOD 
in this life ,COMMA we're dead anyway .PERIOD 
woman :COLON perhaps .PERIOD we have to turn it into a moral war .PERIOD 
zvika :COLON i said ,COMMA ok ,COMMA that's bat-chen ,COMMA that's my daughter .PERIOD 
are you sure she is dead ?QUESTIONMARK 
when we got to here ,COMMA we saw three israeli military jeeps parked on the side of the road .PERIOD 
george :COLON but there is a teacher that is in charge ?QUESTIONMARK 
but after thinking logically about it ,COMMA i didn't find any reason why not to meet them and let them know of our suffering .PERIOD 
we see that there are palestinians who suffered a lot ,COMMA who lost children ,COMMA and still believe in the peace process and in reconciliation .PERIOD 
yes .PERIOD yes !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
but i've been trying to think about ways to give power to these independent voices ,COMMA to give power to the filmmakers ,COMMA to give power to people who are trying to use film for change .PERIOD 
there's just vision ,COMMA that are working with palestinians and israelis who are working together for peace ,COMMA and documenting that process and getting interviews out there and using this film to take to congress to show that it's a powerful tool to show that this is a woman who's had her daughter killed in an attack ,COMMA and she believes that there are peaceful ways to solve this .PERIOD 
there's working films and there's current tv ,COMMA which is an incredible platform for people around the world to be able to put their - yes ,COMMA it's amazing .PERIOD 
there are people that want to be a part of this global day of film ,COMMA to be able to provide a platform for independent voices and independent films to get out there .PERIOD 
in the year <NUM> ,COMMA a virtually unknown german mathematician ,COMMA named theodor kaluza suggested a very bold and ,COMMA in some ways ,COMMA a very bizarre idea .PERIOD 
that is in addition to left ,COMMA right ,COMMA back ,COMMA forth and up ,COMMA down ,COMMA kaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space that for some reason we don't yet see .PERIOD 
he ,COMMA like einstein ,COMMA was in search of what we call a unified theory .PERIOD 
maybe i can play the same game with the other known force ,COMMA which was ,COMMA at that time ,COMMA known as the electromagnetic force - we know of others today ,COMMA but at that time that was the only other one people were thinking about .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded ,COMMA two questions immediately arise from his observation .PERIOD 
it's very hard to see it ,COMMA though ,COMMA from far away .PERIOD 
so many people worked on it ,COMMA but by the <NUM> ,COMMA certainly by the <NUM> ,COMMA this strange but very compelling idea of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away .PERIOD 
in our era ,COMMA a new approach to unify the laws of physics is being pursued by physicists such as myself ,COMMA many others around the world ,COMMA it's called superstring theory ,COMMA as you were indicating .PERIOD 
and there you see unification ,COMMA because matter particles ,COMMA electrons and quarks ,COMMA radiation particles ,COMMA photons ,COMMA gravitons ,COMMA are all built up from one entity .PERIOD 
one of the other predictions of string theory - no ,COMMA that's not one of the other predictions of string theory .PERIOD 
and that question is this :COLON when we look around the world ,COMMA as scientists have done for the last hundred years ,COMMA there appear to be about <NUM> numbers that really describe our universe .PERIOD 
not yet .PERIOD 
but we believe the answer for why those numbers have the values they do may rely on the form of the extra dimensions .PERIOD 
this is an example of something known as a calabi-yau shape - name isn't all that important .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA as you can see ,COMMA the extra dimensions fold in on themselves and intertwine in a very interesting shape ,COMMA interesting structure .PERIOD 
and the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like ,COMMA then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us would look like this on the tiniest of scales .PERIOD 
and this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime .PERIOD 
and yet ,COMMA even at this most fundamental level ,COMMA context is everything .PERIOD 
and now you see it .PERIOD 
there is no a priori reason why an h has to go between that w and a .PERIOD 
so you don't do it again .PERIOD 
your brain is learning .PERIOD and it's learning that the right side of its visual field is under red illumination ;SEMICOLON the left side of its visual field is under green illumination .PERIOD 
i take it from your response they don't look the same anymore .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK 
why ?QUESTIONMARK because if the tile in that shadow were in fact in shadow ,COMMA and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye as the one outside the shadow ,COMMA it would have to be more reflective - just the laws of physics .PERIOD 
which means we can bring all this information together to create some incredibly strong illusions .PERIOD 
and they land on the flower .PERIOD they stick their tongue in there ,COMMA called a proboscis ,COMMA and they drink sugar water .PERIOD 
so they are using the relationships between the colors to solve the puzzle ,COMMA which is exactly what we do .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA illusions are often used ,COMMA especially in art ,COMMA in the words of a more contemporary artist ,COMMA to demonstrate the fragility of our senses .PERIOD 
instead ,COMMA color tells us something completely different ,COMMA that the brain didn't actually evolve to see the world the way it is .PERIOD 
we can't .PERIOD instead ,COMMA the brain evolved to see the world the way it was useful to see in the past .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA one of the ways we do in my lab and studio is we translate the light into sound and we enable people to hear their visual world .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA working with kids ,COMMA they created images ,COMMA thinking about what might the images you see sound like if we could listen to them .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA now ,COMMA what i want to do :COLON i'm going to put the middle nine surfaces here under yellow illumination by simply putting a filter behind them .PERIOD 
the question is ,COMMA is that an illusion ?QUESTIONMARK 
and they're different .PERIOD 
and you can make your own decision ,COMMA and then you'll decide whether the invasion was worth it .PERIOD 
that's how you think about security - in terms of the trade-off .PERIOD 
i'll give you the short answer .PERIOD 
now most of the time ,COMMA that works .PERIOD 
we've developed this ability because it makes evolutionary sense .PERIOD 
the unknown is perceived to be riskier than the familiar .PERIOD 
if you hear a lot about tiger attacks ,COMMA there must be a lot of tigers around .PERIOD 
when something is so common ,COMMA it's no longer news - car crashes ,COMMA domestic violence - those are the risks you worry about .PERIOD 
there's no real word for stuff that makes us secure ,COMMA but doesn't make us feel secure .PERIOD 
and there are two ways to do this .PERIOD 
enough real world examples helps .PERIOD 
security theater's exposed when it's obvious that it's not working properly .PERIOD 
if ,COMMA for example ,COMMA terrorism almost never happens ,COMMA it's really hard to judge the efficacy of counter-terrorist measures .PERIOD 
it doesn't change ;SEMICOLON it's real .PERIOD 
we couldn't have a germ theory of disease before we invented the microscope to see them .PERIOD 
where do we get these models ?QUESTIONMARK we get them from others .PERIOD 
think of models of terrorism ,COMMA child kidnapping ,COMMA airline safety ,COMMA car safety .PERIOD 
models can come from industry .PERIOD 
for us ,COMMA we're very facile around electricity .PERIOD 
now it had a name ,COMMA which made it scarier than the regular flu ,COMMA even though it was more deadly .PERIOD 
as the novelty wore off ,COMMA the months went by ,COMMA there was some amount of tolerance ,COMMA people got used to it .PERIOD 
we have feeling ,COMMA model ,COMMA reality .PERIOD 
new models that extend long periods of time are hard .PERIOD 
global warming is a great example .PERIOD 
strong feelings can create a model .PERIOD 
and that's okay .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA what we want is people to get familiar enough with better models - have it reflected in their feelings - to allow them to make security trade-offs .PERIOD 
remember i said feeling ,COMMA model ,COMMA reality ;SEMICOLON i said reality doesn't change .PERIOD it actually does .PERIOD 
someone else bought it and died .PERIOD 
all human life ,COMMA all life ,COMMA depends on plants .PERIOD 
and plants sometimes find it rather difficult to move because there might be cities and other things in the way .PERIOD 
so if all human life depends on plants ,COMMA doesn't it make sense that perhaps we should try to save them ?QUESTIONMARK 
all the genetic information for future generations of plants are held in seeds .PERIOD 
so all around the world people are doing the same thing .PERIOD 
this is at least <NUM> times bigger .PERIOD 
how much does it cost ?QUESTIONMARK 
the future research is how can we find the genetic and molecular markers for the viability of seeds ,COMMA without having to plant them every <NUM> years ?QUESTIONMARK 
and it was found close to here ,COMMA stanford .PERIOD 
some lasted 14-and-a-half minutes .PERIOD 
couldn't do it .PERIOD could not wait .PERIOD 
put it back .PERIOD 
they would walk around .PERIOD they would play with their skirts and pants .PERIOD 
the sales person that - the customer says ,COMMA i want that .PERIOD and the person says ,COMMA okay ,COMMA here you are .PERIOD 
then you sell a lot more .PERIOD 
the rules of engagement :COLON how to talk ,COMMA when to talk ,COMMA and how to deal with them .PERIOD 
we just have to persevere .PERIOD 
everybody seems to agree with that .PERIOD 
but now ,COMMA as we prepare to talk ,COMMA we understand how little we know .PERIOD 
should we talk to hamas ?QUESTIONMARK 
now my diplomats are instructed to talk to all these groups .PERIOD 
but talking can be done in different ways .PERIOD 
we make a distinction between talking from a diplomatic level and talking at the political level .PERIOD 
in his memoirs ,COMMA long road to freedom ,COMMA he wrote that he survived during those years of captivity because he always decided to look upon his oppressor as also being a human being ,COMMA also being a human being .PERIOD 
now south african friends will know that was very painful .PERIOD 
dialogue is not easy - not between individuals ,COMMA not between groups ,COMMA not between governments - but it is very necessary .PERIOD 
but that strategy seldom takes you very far .PERIOD 
we could never have done the convention against anti-personnel landmines and the convention that is banning cluster munitions unless we had done diplomacy differently ,COMMA by engaging with civil society .PERIOD 
how are we going to solve climate change through negotiations ,COMMA unless we are able to make civil society and people ,COMMA not part of the problem ,COMMA but part of the solution ?QUESTIONMARK 
what is the legitimacy of diplomacy ,COMMA of the the solution we devise as diplomats if they cannot be reflected and understood by also these broader forces of societies that we now very loosely call groups ?QUESTIONMARK 
the diplomatic toolbox is actually full of different tools we can use to strengthen our communication .PERIOD 
in my country ,COMMA i have seen how the council of islamist groups and christian groups came together ,COMMA not as a government initiative ,COMMA but they came together on their own initiative to establish contact and dialogue in times where things were pretty low-key tension .PERIOD 
how are we going to settle and build a bigger we to deal with our issues if we don't improve our skills of communication ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA i'm in chile ,COMMA in the atacama desert ,COMMA sitting in a hotel lobby ,COMMA because that's the only place that i can get a wi-fi connection ,COMMA and i have this picture up on my screen ,COMMA and a woman comes up behind me .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA excuse me !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
this is a gentoo penguin .PERIOD and she was still skeptical .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA one of the things that i love to do is travel around the world and look at archaeological sites .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA one thing that isn't a mystery ,COMMA actually ,COMMA was when i grew up - because when i was a little kid ,COMMA i'd seen these pictures - and i thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA why that look on the face ?QUESTIONMARK 
in fact ,COMMA in many of the statues ,COMMA when you excavate them ,COMMA the backs are totally smooth - almost glass smooth .PERIOD 
we're trying to get all of the permissions to get everything all set ,COMMA to get it going .PERIOD 
in this case ,COMMA we're working with a major medical foundation to develop inexpensive ways of diagnosing diseases in developing countries .PERIOD 
various parts of the world will have a cult food that people get enormously attached to - there's tremendous traditions ,COMMA there's secrecy .PERIOD 
and i'm trying to use a very scientific approach .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i do a lot of work on dinosaurs .PERIOD 
not the same one ,COMMA actually .PERIOD this is a cast ,COMMA which i had bought ,COMMA and then ,COMMA after buying the cast ,COMMA i found my own ,COMMA and i don't have room for two .PERIOD 
it's something that can inform all sorts of science in unexpected ways .PERIOD 
these days ,COMMA bits are cheap .PERIOD unfortunately ,COMMA that means you've got to spend more time sorting through them .PERIOD 
then ,COMMA a little bit later ,COMMA i start getting some pictures like this .PERIOD 
that's kind of what it's like .PERIOD 
and you know ,COMMA when i was at microsoft ,COMMA that was so engrossing ,COMMA and the whole industry was expanding so much ,COMMA that it did tend to crowd out most of the other things in my life .PERIOD 
the sound made flicking a wall switch off is of a completely different nature .PERIOD 
or the recorded crowing of a rooster ?QUESTIONMARK 
that's the end of that .PERIOD 
take-out sandwich shops ,COMMA film processing drop-offs ,COMMA peep-shows and necktie stores .PERIOD 
you were late for school again this morning .PERIOD 
we have fading memories of that provisional temple ,COMMA erected each time an adult sat down .PERIOD 
the next story is called the haverpiece collection a nondescript warehouse ,COMMA visible for a moment from the northbound lanes of the prykushko expressway ,COMMA serves as the temporary resting place for the haverpiece collection of european dried fruit .PERIOD 
do you remember wandering as a child through those dark wooden storefront galleries ?QUESTIONMARK 
a shoe made of apricot leather for the daughter of a czar .PERIOD 
and that this ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA will be the way that we treat cancer in the future .PERIOD 
it is very useful in certain circumstances .PERIOD 
it's the one theory that the biologists ever really got right .PERIOD 
you predict a black hole ,COMMA and you look out the telescope and there it is ,COMMA just like you said .PERIOD 
and so we can discover things that probably you could have found by looking at enough of your relatives ,COMMA but they may be surprising .PERIOD 
and applied minds gets a lot of calls from people who want help with their problems ,COMMA and i didn't think this was a very likely one to call back ,COMMA so i kept on giving him to the delay list .PERIOD 
and i'll show you what that protein measurement looks like .PERIOD 
we sort out the proteins - from left to right is the weight of the fragments that we're getting ,COMMA and from top to bottom is how slippery they are .PERIOD 
and you can see how the lines occur in these little groups of bump ,COMMA bump ,COMMA bump ,COMMA bump ,COMMA bump .PERIOD 
and many people in this audience probably wouldn't be alive if doctors didn't do this .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA it's in the kitchen .PERIOD oh ,COMMA you must have kitchen water .PERIOD 
so your house is dealing with leaks all the time ,COMMA but it's fixing them .PERIOD it's draining them out and so on .PERIOD 
and so i gave this talk and said ,COMMA why don't you guys do this ?QUESTIONMARK 
but design a program of treatments specifically for you and help your body guide back to health - guide your body back to health .PERIOD 
so thank you very much .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i want to tell you a quick story .PERIOD 
super bowl .PERIOD i heard it over here .PERIOD it was the date of the super bowl .PERIOD 
and there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way .PERIOD 
but when we talked to people ,COMMA it appeared that a funnel effect had happened in these tribes all across the united states .PERIOD 
but not just work .PERIOD it's within these tribes that societies get built ,COMMA that important things happen .PERIOD 
if you focus in on a group like this - this happens to be a usc game - and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras and do magnification factors so you could see individual people ,COMMA you would in fact see not a single crowd ,COMMA just like there is not a single crowd here ,COMMA but you would see these tribes that are then coming together .PERIOD 
not all tribes are the same ,COMMA and what makes the difference is the culture .PERIOD 
this is the kid who shot up virginia tech .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this other book that steve mentioned ,COMMA that just came out ,COMMA called the three laws of performance ,COMMA my colleague ,COMMA steve zaffron and i ,COMMA argue that as people see the world ,COMMA so they behave .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA if people see the world in such a way that life sucks ,COMMA then their behavior will follow automatically from that .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA my birthday is coming up shortly ,COMMA and my driver's license expires .PERIOD 
the amount of world-changing behavior that would happen ?QUESTIONMARK 
a whole group of people communicating that way ,COMMA talking that way .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA we find these in places where really smart ,COMMA successful people show up .PERIOD 
it was not christmas time .PERIOD there was a christmas tree .PERIOD 
there is ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA another stage .PERIOD 
there was no road map .PERIOD no one had ever done anything like this before .PERIOD 
and people ,COMMA at the time ,COMMA feared that south africa would end up going the way that rwanda has gone ,COMMA descending into one skirmish after another in a civil war that seems to have no end .PERIOD 
what about martin luther king ?QUESTIONMARK 
in fact ,COMMA martin luther king's most famous line was at stage three .PERIOD 
<NUM> percent of working tribes say ,COMMA these are employed tribes ,COMMA say ,COMMA i'm great and you're not .PERIOD 
but you don't leave them where you found them .PERIOD okay ?QUESTIONMARK 
i don't know anybody .PERIOD 
we move people from stage one to stage two by getting them in a new tribe and then ,COMMA over time ,COMMA getting them connected .PERIOD 
but we're not done yet .PERIOD because then how do we go from stage four ,COMMA which is great ,COMMA to stage five ?QUESTIONMARK 
incidentally ,COMMA they did pull it off .PERIOD 
and they released the first-ever world poll .PERIOD 
we're here to celebrate compassion .PERIOD 
but kindness is an everyday byproduct of all the great virtues .PERIOD 
and in that light ,COMMA for the religious ,COMMA compassion also brings us into the territory of mystery - encouraging us not just to see beauty ,COMMA but perhaps also to look for the face of god in the moment of suffering ,COMMA in the face of a stranger ,COMMA in the face of the vibrant religious other .PERIOD 
the communities that jean vanier founded ,COMMA like jean vanier himself ,COMMA exude tenderness .PERIOD 
and compassion can also have those qualities .PERIOD 
and compassion is unleashed in wider and wider circles by signs and stories ,COMMA never by statistics and strategies .PERIOD 
rachel naomi remen says this is an important and empowering story for our time ,COMMA because this story insists that each and every one of us ,COMMA frail and flawed as we may be ,COMMA inadequate as we may feel ,COMMA has exactly what's needed to help repair the part of the world that we can see and touch .PERIOD 
this is going to change science ,COMMA i believe ,COMMA and it will change religion .PERIOD 
einstein believed deeply that science should transcend national and ethnic divisions .PERIOD 
but he watched physicists and chemists become the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction in the early <NUM> century .PERIOD 
so in this photograph you see a mind looking out a window at what might be a cathedral - it's not .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol .PERIOD 
and it went like this :COLON r-o-w-d-i-e ,COMMA that's the way we spell rowdie .PERIOD 
and i just waited for the time that i could go off and read my books .PERIOD 
and i was always going off to crowded bars when i really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends .PERIOD 
so even if you're an extrovert yourself ,COMMA i'm talking about your coworkers and your spouses and your children and the person sitting next to you right now - all of them subject to this bias that is pretty deep and real in our society .PERIOD 
shyness is about fear of social judgment .PERIOD 
so the key then to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in the zone of stimulation that is right for us .PERIOD 
and also we have this belief system right now that i call the new groupthink ,COMMA which holds that all creativity and all productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place .PERIOD 
and the vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert ,COMMA even though introverts actually get better grades and are more knowledgeable ,COMMA according to research .PERIOD 
now i think at this point it's important for me to say that i actually love extroverts .PERIOD 
the same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountain tops also teach us love and trust .PERIOD 
here's margaret atwood ,COMMA cat's eye .PERIOD 
but here's the thing about my grandfather .PERIOD 
it was my version of my grandfather's hours of the day alone in his library .PERIOD 
and i call this my year of speaking dangerously .PERIOD 
but we need much more privacy and much more freedom and much more autonomy at work .PERIOD 
we need to be teaching kids to work together ,COMMA for sure ,COMMA but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own .PERIOD 
and that's okay .PERIOD 
then ,COMMA about the initiative that chris mentioned ,COMMA that we decided to launch at amd that we call <NUM> .PERIOD 
he explained to me about johann strauss ,COMMA and how he created the waltzes that became so famous in the world .PERIOD 
that's year by year .PERIOD this comes from our friends at gapminder.com .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we talked about ways in which perhaps one could partner to be able to bring the cost of this technology down .PERIOD 
and frankly - and i know that sometimes i offend some of my customers when i say this ,COMMA but i truly mean it - if you could take the name of the computer off the top of it ,COMMA it would be very difficult to judge who made it ,COMMA because they're all highly commoditized but they're all different .PERIOD 
and the last piece ,COMMA which is really important - and this is an opinion that we have ,COMMA not shared by many ,COMMA this is one where we seem to stand alone ,COMMA on this one - is that we really believe that the greatest success of this initiative can come by fostering local ,COMMA integrated ,COMMA end-to-end ecosystems .PERIOD 
we just recently opened a learning laboratory in a school in the west cape in south africa ,COMMA in a school that's called nelson mandela school ,COMMA and when you see the faces and activities of these children being able to access computers ,COMMA it's just phenomenal .PERIOD 
and we're really thrilled about the opportunity to be part of this ,COMMA and can't wait to see what comes out of this exciting ,COMMA exciting activity .PERIOD 
i'll tell you that one of the things that i feel is really critical for us in industry ,COMMA in business ,COMMA is to be able to be passionate about solving these problems .PERIOD 
i was eager to go off to college ,COMMA and go find girls ,COMMA and study ,COMMA and girls ,COMMA and study ,COMMA but then i finished college and i fell in love .PERIOD 
and on my wedding day ,COMMA my father came to me again and said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i'm going to remind you again ,COMMA that each generation has to do better than the last one .PERIOD 
just existing .PERIOD 
i really think that's there's this inner desire .PERIOD 
and all of a sudden ,COMMA it brought a lot of money and a lot of attention .PERIOD 
that's kind of a no-brainer .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what is it for ?QUESTIONMARK 
so i believe ,COMMA essentially ,COMMA that leadership is stewardship .PERIOD 
this is not my planet .PERIOD it wasn't mine before i was born .PERIOD 
do you think we have a stewardship here ,COMMA to take the environment seriously ?QUESTIONMARK 
what we believe ,COMMA obviously - and you know this - determines our behavior ,COMMA and our behavior determines what we become in life .PERIOD 
my wife and i first made five decisions on what to do with the money .PERIOD 
we just said ,COMMA we're not going to use it on us .PERIOD 
believe me ,COMMA there's a whole lot easier ways to make money .PERIOD 
the last thing we did is we became what i call reverse tithers .PERIOD 
and that is ,COMMA when my wife and i got married <NUM> years ago ,COMMA we started tithing .PERIOD 
materialism is all about getting - get ,COMMA get ,COMMA get ,COMMA get all you can ,COMMA can all you get ,COMMA sit on the can and spoil the rest .PERIOD 
and we think that the good life is actually looking good - that's most important of all - looking good ,COMMA feeling good and having the goods .PERIOD 
there's a chapter in the bible called psalm <NUM> ,COMMA and it's solomon's prayer for more influence .PERIOD 
basically ,COMMA he's talking about all the marginalized in society .PERIOD 
it's a shepherd's staff .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA my god doesn't have to show up on cheese bread .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA if god's going to show up ,COMMA he's not going to show up on cheese bread .PERIOD 
but he doesn't do miracles just to show off .PERIOD 
what do you do with a shepherd's staff ?QUESTIONMARK 
you pull them or you poke them ,COMMA one or the other .PERIOD 
and it represents your influence .PERIOD 
and that gives with you enormous influence .PERIOD 
what are you doing with what you've been given ?QUESTIONMARK 
why would god wire you to do something and then not have you do it ?QUESTIONMARK 
and in some countries - let me pick afghanistan - <NUM> percent of the little girls don't go to school .PERIOD 
so in the three years since i talked at ted and showed a prototype ,COMMA it's gone from an idea to a real laptop .PERIOD 
we have about a quarter of a million in transit to those and other children ,COMMA and then there are another quarter of a million more that are being ordered at this moment .PERIOD 
and that engine is going to see the results in <NUM> years .PERIOD 
they own the laptops .PERIOD they take them home .PERIOD 
and the reason she brought her mother is that this six-year-old child had been teaching her mother how to read and write .PERIOD 
so it's <NUM> ,COMMA i'm in college ,COMMA and a friend and i go on a road trip from providence ,COMMA rhode island to portland ,COMMA oregon .PERIOD 
we get it in the abstract .PERIOD 
but the thing is ,COMMA the coyote runs off the cliff right after him .PERIOD 
that's when he falls .PERIOD 
this is not mine ,COMMA by the way .PERIOD 
we learn these really bad lessons really well .PERIOD 
when the vice president for health care quality at beth israel spoke about this incident ,COMMA he said something very interesting .PERIOD 
and yeah ,COMMA it is also why we get things wrong .PERIOD 
i just imagined it everywhere ,COMMA which has happened .PERIOD 
and the crypto-theme is :COLON' i thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead .PERIOD' and the thing is ,COMMA says ira glass ,COMMA we need this .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA you know ,COMMA our stories are like this because our lives are like this .PERIOD 
and something else happened instead .PERIOD 
because half the stuff that's the most mind-boggling and world-altering - ted <NUM> - eh .PERIOD 
we come up with another idea .PERIOD 
bioenergy isn't global warming .PERIOD bioenergy is something which seems counterintuitive .PERIOD bioenergy is oil .PERIOD it's gas .PERIOD it's coal .PERIOD and part of building that bridge to the future ,COMMA to the point where we can actually see the oceans in a rational way ,COMMA or put up these geo-spatial orbits that will twirl or do microwaves or stuff ,COMMA is going to depend on how we understand bioenergy and manage it .PERIOD and to do that ,COMMA you really have to look first at agriculture .PERIOD 
maybe that's one of the reasons why if you fly over west texas ,COMMA the types of wells that you're beginning to see don't look unlike those pictures of kansas and those irrigated plots .PERIOD 
which is curious as we debate all this stuff .PERIOD but as you think of coal ,COMMA this is what burned wheat kernels look like .PERIOD not entirely unlike coal .PERIOD 
that is what bioenergy is .PERIOD it is not ethanol .PERIOD it is not subsidies to a few companies .PERIOD it is not importing corn into iowa because you've built so many of these ethanol plants .PERIOD it is beginning to understand the transition that occurred in agriculture ,COMMA from brute force into biological force .PERIOD and in the measure that you can do that ,COMMA you can clean some stuff ,COMMA and you can clean it pretty quickly .PERIOD 
but in the meantime ,COMMA for the next decade at least ,COMMA the name of the game is hydrocarbons .PERIOD and be that oil ,COMMA be that gas ,COMMA be that coal ,COMMA this is what we're dealing with .PERIOD and before i make this talk too long ,COMMA here's what's happening in the current energy system .PERIOD 
<NUM> percent of the energy we consume are hydrocarbons .PERIOD that means <NUM> percent of the stuff we're consuming are probably processed plants and amoebas and the rest of the stuff .PERIOD and there's a role in here for conservation .PERIOD there's a role in here for alternative stuff ,COMMA but we've also got to get that other portion right .PERIOD 
and what gave her inspiration and meaning was the fact that she was taking care of people who were far away from home .PERIOD 
and i initially ended up in the business section of the bookstore looking for a business solution .PERIOD 
each of us ,COMMA no matter what our role is in business ,COMMA has some hierarchy of needs in the workplace .PERIOD 
so as i started reading more maslow ,COMMA what i started to realize is that maslow ,COMMA later in his life ,COMMA wanted to take this hierarchy for the individual and apply it to the collective ,COMMA to organizations and specifically to business .PERIOD 
but as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressing the higher needs of our employees and our customers ,COMMA i realized we had no metrics .PERIOD 
so i went out and studied a bunch of things ,COMMA and i found a survey that showed that <NUM> percent of business leaders worldwide believe that the intangibles are important in their business ,COMMA things like intellectual property ,COMMA their corporate culture ,COMMA their brand loyalty ,COMMA and yet ,COMMA only five percent of those same leaders actually had a means of measuring the intangibles in their business .PERIOD 
and he's a very wise man ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA listen ,COMMA bhutan's goal is not to create happiness .PERIOD 
one of those key indicators is :COLON how do the bhutanese feel about how they spend their time each day ?QUESTIONMARK 
or in other words ,COMMA i think the bhutanese believe happiness equals wanting what you have - imagine gratitude - divided by having what you want - gratification .PERIOD 
so it suggests that the momentum is shifting .PERIOD 
as you look at these two columns here ,COMMA doesn't it make you feel like it's time for us to start figuring out a new way to count ,COMMA a new way to imagine what's important to us in life ?QUESTIONMARK 
we're spending <NUM> billion dollars on the census .PERIOD 
we're asking <NUM> simple questions - it is simplicity .PERIOD 
they're about demographics .PERIOD 
abe maslow said long ago something you've heard before ,COMMA but you didn't realize it was him .PERIOD 
he said ,COMMA if the only tool you have is a hammer ,COMMA everything starts to look like a nail .PERIOD 
in vivian's case ,COMMA her unit of production isn't the tangible hours she works ,COMMA it's the intangible difference she makes during that one hour of work .PERIOD 
he stayed there a hundred times in the last <NUM> years ,COMMA and he's loyal to the property because of the relationship that vivian and her fellow employees have created with him .PERIOD 
we don't have to choose between inspired employees and sizable profits ,COMMA we can have both .PERIOD 
at least ,COMMA as he wrote ,COMMA when a robot dies ,COMMA you don't have to write a letter to its mother .PERIOD 
the u.s. is currently ahead in military robotics right now ,COMMA but we know that in technology there's no such thing as a permanent first move or advantage .PERIOD 
there's already a jihadi website that you can go on and remotely detonate an ied in iraq while sitting at your home computer .PERIOD 
soldiers have a name for these clips .PERIOD 
the typical one that i was sent was an email that had an attachment of video of a predator strike taking out an enemy site .PERIOD missile hits ,COMMA bodies burst into the air with the explosion .PERIOD 
it was set to music .PERIOD 
and so we kind of have this kind of moral feel-good moment .PERIOD 
that bottle winds up getting burned .PERIOD 
and so poor people who are making these products in petrochemical centers like cancer alley ,COMMA poor people who are consuming these products disproportionately ,COMMA and then poor people ,COMMA who even at the tail end of the recycling are having their lives shortened ,COMMA are all being harmed greatly by this addiction that we have to disposability .PERIOD 
now you think to yourself - because i know how you are - you say ,COMMA that sure is terrible for those poor people .PERIOD 
it's just awful ,COMMA those poor people .PERIOD 
i hope someone does something to help them .PERIOD 
but guess what ?QUESTIONMARK 
we don't have disposable resources .PERIOD 
and as we all begin to come back to that basic understanding ,COMMA new opportunities for action begin to emerge .PERIOD 
but if we want to make something hard ,COMMA we come up ,COMMA i know ,COMMA i'm going to make a hard substance .PERIOD 
we just had this vote ,COMMA and everybody's like ,COMMA well ,COMMA not in our state .PERIOD 
just so proud .PERIOD 
but california ,COMMA though we lead the world in some of the green stuff ,COMMA we also ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA lead the world in some of the gulag stuff .PERIOD 
we have a moral challenge in this moment .PERIOD 
and really ,COMMA they fundamentally told you ,COMMA are you going to hug a tree ,COMMA or are you going to hug a child ?QUESTIONMARK pick .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA when you start working on issues like plastic ,COMMA you realize that the whole thing is connected ,COMMA and luckily most of us are blessed to have two arms .PERIOD 
they'd worn themselves out ,COMMA beating themselves against the window ,COMMA and ,COMMA well ,COMMA they were easy to capture .PERIOD 
i've called this vehicle ,COMMA generically ,COMMA a volantor ,COMMA after the latin word volant ,COMMA meaning ,COMMA to fly in a light ,COMMA nimble manner .PERIOD 
volantor-like helicopter ,COMMA perhaps .PERIOD 
the press calls my particular volantor a skycar .PERIOD 
one could say that a helicopter does pretty much what the hummingbird does ,COMMA and gets around in much the same way ,COMMA and it's true ,COMMA but a helicopter is a very complex device .PERIOD 
because if you're in this world ,COMMA where computers are controlling what you're doing ,COMMA it's going to be very critical that something can't fail on you .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA you can't right now take off from your home because it's too noisy .PERIOD 
i mean to be able to take off from your home ,COMMA you'd have to be extremely quiet .PERIOD 
after all ,COMMA if you can fly like that ,COMMA why are you going to drive around on a highway ?QUESTIONMARK 
you can play computer games ,COMMA you can sleep ,COMMA you can read on the way .PERIOD 
and then through the various years we invented various vehicles .PERIOD 
redundancy is the critical issue here .PERIOD 
if you want to stay alive you've got to have backups .PERIOD 
that's a very significant incentive for getting out of san francisco .PERIOD 
but you better be the first one out of town as the real estate values go to hell .PERIOD 
there's an interesting poll that came out recently under nas - i think it's msnbc - in which they asked the question ,COMMA are you in the market for a volantor ?QUESTIONMARK 
i mean ,COMMA think about how much we love this .PERIOD 
think about that .PERIOD 
what dr. soljacic figured out how to do was separate the coils in a transformer to a greater distance than the size of those transformers using this technology ,COMMA which is not dissimilar from the way an opera singer shatters a glass on the other side of the room .PERIOD 
and what i'm going to do is to show you pretty much what's here .PERIOD 
and if the demo gods are willing ,COMMA in about <NUM> seconds or so we should see it .PERIOD 
think about it .PERIOD you don't want those ugly cords coming down .PERIOD 
imagine if you can get rid of it .PERIOD 
and i'll do it again ,COMMA just for safety's sake .PERIOD 
we're an equal opportunity designer of this sort of thing .PERIOD 
it runs the android operating system .PERIOD 
so we put a little sleeve on the back ,COMMA but we should be able to get this guy to wake up too .PERIOD 
and think of what that would do for you .PERIOD 
and third ,COMMA our bodies are filters and storehouses for environmental toxins .PERIOD 
if you're cremated ,COMMA all those toxins i mentioned are released into the atmosphere .PERIOD 
so by trying to preserve our dead bodies ,COMMA we deny death ,COMMA poison the living and further harm the environment .PERIOD 
i realize this is not the kind of relationship that we usually aspire to have with our food .PERIOD 
the decompiculture society shares a vision of a cultural shift ,COMMA from our current culture of death denial and body preservation to one of decompiculture ,COMMA a radical acceptance of death and decomposition .PERIOD 
so the virtual earth initiative ,COMMA and other types of these initiatives ,COMMA are all about extending our current search metaphor .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA a little unknown secret is his brother actually works on the virtual earth team .PERIOD 
when we think about how all this comes together ,COMMA it's all about software ,COMMA algorithms and math .PERIOD 
we do this all through software ,COMMA algorithms and math - a highly automated pipeline creating these cities .PERIOD 
but what we've found is they like the fluidity of the 3-d model .PERIOD 
i'm going to use these two countries to make an economic argument for democracy ,COMMA rather than against democracy .PERIOD 
look at the skyline of shanghai .PERIOD 
the picture on india is the dharavi slum of mumbai in india .PERIOD 
in an interview printed in the financial press of india ,COMMA he said that he wants to make mumbai another shanghai .PERIOD 
this is an oxford-trained economist steeped in humanistic values ,COMMA and yet he agrees with the high-pressure tactics of shanghai .PERIOD 
this is a very little known fact about the two countries .PERIOD 
the economy grows ,COMMA government accumulates more resources ,COMMA and the government can invest in infrastructure - rather than infrastructure being a cause for economic growth .PERIOD 
one reason is the east asian model .PERIOD 
korea succeeded ,COMMA north korea didn't .PERIOD 
burma didn't succeed .PERIOD 
in china ,COMMA it's all women .PERIOD 
by looking at these two pictures ,COMMA i say no ,COMMA it won't overtake china for a while .PERIOD 
actually ,COMMA the answer is more nuanced and subtle than that .PERIOD 
indira gandhi declared emergency rule in <NUM> .PERIOD 
why do many people believe that india is still a growth disaster ?QUESTIONMARK 
but china is a superstar in terms of economic growth .PERIOD 
this is the grand cafe here in oxford .PERIOD 
that's its great claim to fame ,COMMA and i wanted to show it to you ,COMMA not because i want to give you the kind of starbucks tour of historic england ,COMMA but rather because the english coffeehouse was crucial to the development and spread of one of the great intellectual flowerings of the last <NUM> years ,COMMA what we now call the enlightenment .PERIOD 
what are the environments that lead to unusual levels of innovation ,COMMA unusual levels of creativity ?QUESTIONMARK 
and this is what they ended up coming with .PERIOD 
it's called a neonurture device .PERIOD 
in the inside ,COMMA it's all car parts .PERIOD 
it's got a fan ,COMMA it's got headlights for warmth ,COMMA it's got door chimes for alarm - it runs off a car battery .PERIOD 
this is hogarth's famous painting of a kind of political dinner at a tavern ,COMMA but this is what the coffee shops looked like back then .PERIOD 
and one of the problems with this is that people are actually - when you research this field - people are notoriously unreliable ,COMMA when they actually kind of self-report on where they have their own good ideas ,COMMA or their history of their best ideas .PERIOD 
so when they were sitting in front of the microscope ,COMMA when they were talking to their colleague at the water cooler ,COMMA and all these things .PERIOD 
but that's a key thing .PERIOD 
and so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues ,COMMA and everybody's like ,COMMA no ,COMMA i hadn't thought of doing that .PERIOD 
and so guier and weiffenbach go back to weiffenbach's office ,COMMA and they start kind of noodling around - hacking ,COMMA as we might call it now .PERIOD 
we should record it .PERIOD 
and they thought about it and they said ,COMMA well ,COMMA i guess maybe you could .PERIOD let's run the numbers here .PERIOD 
and i bet you one of you ,COMMA if not more ,COMMA has used said device and said satellite system to locate a nearby coffeehouse somewhere in the last - in the last day or last week ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
chance favors the connected mind .PERIOD 
my story starts way before i was born .PERIOD 
they got on and didn't know where they were going ,COMMA and ended up in canada .PERIOD 
i was <NUM> ,COMMA and i emailed professors at the local university to see if maybe i could go work in their lab .PERIOD and hardly anyone responded .PERIOD 
and so i thought ,COMMA maybe if it can promote cell growth ,COMMA it can inhibit cell death ,COMMA too .PERIOD 
and so that's the project that i pursued for that year ,COMMA and it's continuing now as well ,COMMA and found that a specific purine derivative called guanidine had inhibited the cell growth by approximately <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
but i'd heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time ,COMMA so how did the good and bad go together ?QUESTIONMARK 
and while i was doing this ,COMMA i was reading the cancer literature ,COMMA trying to - again - familiarize myself with this new medical field .PERIOD 
and it was really interesting - there were articles correlating if you have a bone fracture ,COMMA and then bone cancer arises .PERIOD 
it hasn't yet become fine-tuned enough to finish what has been initiated .PERIOD 
if we eliminate cancer the way we're trying to do now ,COMMA with chemotherapy and radiation ,COMMA we're bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins ,COMMA or with radiation ,COMMA trying to kill it .PERIOD 
we're removing the cancer cells ,COMMA but we're revealing the previous damage that the body has tried to fix .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this really changed my view of looking at cancer .PERIOD 
and what metastases are is when the tumor - when a piece - breaks off and travels through the blood stream and goes to a different organ .PERIOD that's what a metastasis is .PERIOD 
but then again ,COMMA this fact that the metastases didn't go to skeletal muscle made that seem unlikely .PERIOD 
and i guess i'll keep investigating until i get the answers .PERIOD 
is it possible that muscle somehow intuitively knows that it needs this blood supply ?QUESTIONMARK it needs to be constantly contracting ,COMMA so therefore it's almost selfish .PERIOD it's grabbing its blood vessels for itself .PERIOD 
and i hate to say that .PERIOD but it seems as though muscle cell ,COMMA possibly because of all its use ,COMMA has adapted faster than other body tissues to respond to injury ,COMMA to fine-tune this repair response and actually be able to finish the process which the body wants to finish .PERIOD i really believe that the human body is very ,COMMA very smart ,COMMA and we can't counteract something the body is saying to do .PERIOD 
and again ,COMMA some of these may be far-fetched ,COMMA but i figured if there's anywhere to present far-fetched ideas ,COMMA it's here at ted ,COMMA so thank you very much .PERIOD 
some of you have heard the story before ,COMMA but ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA there's somebody in the audience who's never heard this story - in front of an audience - before ,COMMA so i'm a little more nervous than i normally am telling this story .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA my translator left .PERIOD 
they slept on the floor at night .PERIOD 
i had photographed ,COMMA as i said ,COMMA a lot of these kids .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA not at all shy or withdrawn ,COMMA or anything like the other children that i'd photographed .PERIOD 
it was very obvious ,COMMA from the very beginning ,COMMA that she was a leader .PERIOD 
and i said to my translator ,COMMA what's going on ,COMMA why is she crying ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i said ,COMMA i'm <NUM> years old ,COMMA and i live in hotels ,COMMA and i'm not married .PERIOD 
and they had no idea about this request that she'd made of me .PERIOD 
so i finally found myung sung ,COMMA her best friend that she used to play with after school every day .PERIOD 
and i said to the translator ,COMMA what did he say ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA tell him that i am a photographer .PERIOD 
i sort of had this picture of this incredibly wonderful ,COMMA bright ,COMMA happy little child ,COMMA who now appeared to be very withdrawn ,COMMA being enslaved by this family .PERIOD 
so i finally decided ,COMMA i said look ,COMMA - this is all through the translator ,COMMA because ,COMMA this is all ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i don't speak a word of korean - and i said ,COMMA look ,COMMA i'm really glad that hyun-sook has a family to live with .PERIOD 
i don't pretend to understand what's going on here .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA there was an american marine priest that i had met in the course of doing the story ,COMMA who had <NUM> children living in his house .PERIOD 
he had kids from all over korea living there ,COMMA and he would find families for these kids .PERIOD 
hyun-sook stayed at father keene's ,COMMA and her uncle agreed to let her stay there until the adoption went through .PERIOD 
and then she set up a work detail list of who cleaned the orphanage on what day .PERIOD 
we went back to our hotel room ,COMMA and gene was showing natasha also where atlanta was .PERIOD 
and we fall asleep - and i've been in this room ,COMMA you know ,COMMA for a couple of months now .PERIOD 
and they always overheat the hotels in korea terribly ,COMMA so during the day i always left the window open .PERIOD 
and i don't speak korean ,COMMA but i'm hearing these voices ,COMMA and i'm not hearing anger ,COMMA i'm hearing terror .PERIOD 
i remember his son had the l.l .PERIOD bean bootlaces ,COMMA and we're trying to do up his laces .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we ran to the bathroom ,COMMA and got towels ,COMMA and put them over our faces ,COMMA and the kids faces .PERIOD 
eleven people ended up dying in the fire .PERIOD 
five people jumped and died ,COMMA other people were killed by the smoke .PERIOD 
so it turned into a dual celebration ,COMMA because natasha was the first person from this village ever to go to the united states .PERIOD 
this is saying goodbye to everybody at the orphanage .PERIOD 
and the pilot ,COMMA jeff cowley ,COMMA actually went back and adopted one of the other kids at the orphanage after meeting natasha .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA at this point ,COMMA natasha doesn't speak a word of english ,COMMA other than what little father keene taught her .PERIOD 
she learned english in three months .PERIOD 
natasha told me that a lot of the kids thought she was stuck up ,COMMA because they would talk to her and she wouldn't answer ,COMMA and they didn't realize she didn't actually speak english very well ,COMMA in the beginning .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA remember the picture ,COMMA how much she looked like her grandmother ,COMMA at the beginning ?QUESTIONMARK 
the captain of the cheerleaders .PERIOD 
this is her half-sister .PERIOD 
natasha ,COMMA would you just come up ,COMMA for a second ,COMMA just maybe to say hello to everybody ?QUESTIONMARK 
natasha :COLON i've seen pictures millions of times ,COMMA but today was the first time i'm actually seeing him give the whole presentation .PERIOD 
i started crying .PERIOD 
the telescope is actually built similarly to the ,COMMA well-known to you ,COMMA hubble space telescope ,COMMA except it does have an additional lens - a wide-field lens ,COMMA as you would call it as a photographer .PERIOD 
the way we do that ,COMMA actually ,COMMA is with a method ,COMMA which we call the transit method .PERIOD 
but we learn a lot from that :COLON not only that there is a planet there ,COMMA but we also learn its size .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what have we learned ?QUESTIONMARK 
and we do care about planets like the earth because by now we understood that life as a chemical system really needs a smaller planet with water and with rocks and with a lot of complex chemistry to originate ,COMMA to emerge ,COMMA to survive .PERIOD 
so today ,COMMA i'm here to actually give you a first glimpse of what the new telescope ,COMMA kepler ,COMMA has been able to tell us in the last few weeks ,COMMA and ,COMMA lo and behold ,COMMA we are back to the harmony and to fulfilling the dreams of copernicus .PERIOD 
it's about <NUM> million such planets .PERIOD 
so that's great because then we can go and study them - remotely ,COMMA of course - with all the techniques that we already have tested in the past five years .PERIOD 
the one that this step is enabling us to do is coming next .PERIOD 
so the question is :COLON is that chemical phenomenon universal ,COMMA or is it something which depends on the planet ?QUESTIONMARK 
we don't want to go blind because there's too many possibilities ,COMMA and there is not too much lab ,COMMA and there is not enough human time to actually to do all the experiments .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA there are many reasons ,COMMA and you heard some of them in the short talk today .PERIOD 
and that is going to change our worldview in a profound way - not in a dissimilar way as <NUM> years ago ,COMMA copernicus' act did ,COMMA by changing the way we view space and time .PERIOD 
and half the time ,COMMA what's happened is it's related this kind of sense of insignificance to humankind ,COMMA to the earth in a bigger space .PERIOD 
i mean look ,COMMA you can see the necktie ,COMMA but you can't even imagine seeing the size of a little ,COMMA small atom .PERIOD 
so what does this tell us ?QUESTIONMARK 
there is immense ,COMMA powerful potential in life in this universe - especially now that we know that places like the earth are common .PERIOD 
let's start this new revolution at the tail end of the old one ,COMMA with synthetic biology being the way to transform both our environment and our future .PERIOD 
these gapminder bubbles show you how the spread of the virus was in <NUM> in the world ,COMMA or how we estimate that it was .PERIOD 
look ,COMMA india got many infected ,COMMA but had a low level .PERIOD 
and almost the same happens here .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA let me make a fast replay of botswana .PERIOD 
and if people who are infected are treated ,COMMA they don't die of aids .PERIOD 
in spite of pepfar ,COMMA the generous pepfar ,COMMA all people are not reached by treatment ,COMMA and of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries ,COMMA only <NUM> percent are left on treatment after two years .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA it's not .PERIOD look here .PERIOD 
there's a lot of things that we thought ,COMMA that now ,COMMA good research ,COMMA done by african institutions and researchers together with the international researchers ,COMMA show that that's not the case .PERIOD 
see the difference within one african country - it goes from very low level to very high level ,COMMA and most of the provinces in kenya is quite modest .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what is it then ?QUESTIONMARK 
it could be concurrency .PERIOD 
and we have a terrible chlamydia epidemic - terrible chlamydia epidemic which sticks around for many years .PERIOD 
let's talk about past and future billions .PERIOD 
we know that most of that wealth was made after the year <NUM> .PERIOD 
and notice ,COMMA most of that went to the motherland ,COMMA to the imperial metropoles ,COMMA not to their colonial possessions .PERIOD 
so i'm going to translate this into language that you can understand .PERIOD 
let me very briefly tell you what i mean by this ,COMMA synthesizing the work of many economic historians in the process .PERIOD 
that really was a killer application .PERIOD 
property rights :COLON it's not the democracy ,COMMA folks ;SEMICOLON it's having the rule of law based on private property rights .PERIOD 
very few indians today wish that india had gone down mahatma gandhi's road .PERIOD 
finally ,COMMA the work ethic .PERIOD 
he was wrong .PERIOD 
take a look at mathematical attainment by <NUM> year-olds .PERIOD 
now it's just five times ,COMMA and soon it will be <NUM> times .PERIOD 
and could africa get that sequencing wrong ?QUESTIONMARK 
one obvious implication of modern economic history is that it's quite hard to transition to democracy before you've established secure private property rights .PERIOD 
warning :COLON that may not work .PERIOD 
that's the basis for the western model of representative government .PERIOD 
and i think these words really nail it :COLON it means a society based upon the opinion of civilians .PERIOD 
that's not the way history works .PERIOD 
that's one of the most profound insights to come out of the historical study of complex institutions like civilizations .PERIOD 
what's your view on that ?QUESTIONMARK 
niall ferguson :COLON well i really am not just talking about the rise of the east ;SEMICOLON i'm talking about the rise of the rest ,COMMA and that includes south america .PERIOD 
i once asked one of my colleagues at harvard ,COMMA hey ,COMMA is south america part of the west ?QUESTIONMARK 
spiders are not just everywhere ,COMMA but they're extremely diverse .PERIOD 
spiders are also extremely old .PERIOD 
even fossil spiders can make silk ,COMMA as we can see from this impression of a spinneret on this fossil spider .PERIOD 
so this means that both spiders and spider silk have been around for <NUM> million years .PERIOD 
you can see multiple fibers coming out of the spinnerets ,COMMA because each spinneret has many spigots on it .PERIOD 
in an orb-web-weaving spider ,COMMA you can find seven types of silk glands ,COMMA and what i have depicted here in this picture ,COMMA let's start at the one o'clock position ,COMMA there's tubuliform silk glands ,COMMA which are used to make the outer silk of an egg sac .PERIOD 
so silk fibers vary in their strength and also their extensibility .PERIOD 
if it wasn't able to stretch so much ,COMMA then basically when an insect hit the web ,COMMA it would just trampoline right off of it .PERIOD 
some of them are orb-weaving spiders and some of them are non-orb-weaving spiders .PERIOD 
how do groups get anything done ?QUESTIONMARK right ?QUESTIONMARK 
how do you organize a group of individuals so that the output of the group is something coherent and of lasting value ,COMMA instead of just being chaos ?QUESTIONMARK 
and a coordination cost is essentially all of the financial or institutional difficulties in arranging group output .PERIOD 
more recently ,COMMA because the cost of letting groups communicate with each other has fallen through the floor - and communication costs are one of the big inputs to coordination - there has been a second answer ,COMMA which is to put the cooperation into the infrastructure ,COMMA to design systems that coordinate the output of the group as a by-product of the operating of the system ,COMMA without regard to institutional models .PERIOD 
and what i want to call your attention to is not the mermaid parade itself ,COMMA charming though it is ,COMMA but rather to these photos .PERIOD 
first of all ,COMMA when you form an institution ,COMMA you take on a management problem ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
you have to have legal structure .PERIOD 
third ,COMMA forming an institution is inherently exclusionary .PERIOD 
you can't hire everyone in a company ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
when you build cooperation into the infrastructure ,COMMA which is the flickr answer ,COMMA you can leave the people where they are and you take the problem to the individuals ,COMMA rather than moving the individuals to the problem .PERIOD 
in bigger systems ,COMMA the head gets bigger and the tail gets longer ,COMMA so the imbalance increases .PERIOD 
if you go down to five percent ,COMMA you're still accounting for <NUM> percent of the photos .PERIOD 
we've looked at who's contributed to linux ,COMMA and most of the patches have been produced by programmers who've only done one thing .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK 
do you want that patch ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
meetup ,COMMA a service founded so that users could find people in their local area who share their interests and affinities and actually have a real-world meeting offline in a cafe or a pub or what have you .PERIOD 
stay-at-home moms .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK 
it is a one-button operation that you can do for free .PERIOD 
and the answer to that question is ,COMMA it doesn't matter ,COMMA because that's not the right question .PERIOD 
and if there is an answer to that that happens outside the professional framework of journalism ,COMMA it makes no sense to take a professional metaphor and apply it to this distributed class .PERIOD 
they trade tips ,COMMA like ,COMMA if you feel like eating something ,COMMA clean a toilet or the litter box .PERIOD the feeling will pass .PERIOD 
we have an attitude that support groups are inherently beneficial .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA when the larger group is a bunch of drunks ,COMMA and the small group wants to stay sober ,COMMA then we think ,COMMA that's a great support group .PERIOD 
but when the small group is teenage girls who want to stay anorexic by choice ,COMMA then we're horrified .PERIOD 
flavor is king .PERIOD flavor rules .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this is the challenge for this bread .PERIOD 
and this is what every student has to begin with .PERIOD 
everyone who works in the culinary world knows that the first stage of cooking is mise en place ,COMMA which is just a french way of saying ,COMMA get organized .PERIOD 
everything in its place .PERIOD first stage .PERIOD 
stage two is mixing .PERIOD we take the ingredients and we mix them .PERIOD 
and so we ,COMMA in the mixing process ,COMMA have to develop the gluten ,COMMA we have to activate the leaven or the yeast ,COMMA and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly .PERIOD 
and at stage nine we get the dough to the final shape ,COMMA and it goes into the oven - stage <NUM> .PERIOD 
and the starches ,COMMA when they reach about <NUM> degrees ,COMMA gelatinize .PERIOD 
and stage <NUM> ,COMMA we call it cooling - because we never really eat the bread right away .PERIOD 
and we save some of those for the next generation .PERIOD 
so we turn it into flour .PERIOD 
not like hot water made cold ,COMMA or cold water turned hot ,COMMA but water boiled off and becoming steam .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we've got now this flour .PERIOD 
and what do we do ?QUESTIONMARK we add some water .PERIOD 
or another analogy would be ,COMMA a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly .PERIOD 
but we've got this bread ,COMMA and what i did here is to try to ,COMMA again ,COMMA evoke even more flavor from this grain ,COMMA was we've added into it the spent grain from beer-making .PERIOD 
and so this is ,COMMA again ,COMMA hopefully not only a healthy bread ,COMMA but a bread that you will enjoy .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA if i ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA break this bread ,COMMA maybe we can share this now a little bit here .PERIOD 
we'll start a little piece here ,COMMA and i'm going to take a little piece here - i think i'd better taste it myself before you have it at lunch .PERIOD 
let me give you just one example of this .PERIOD 
now the question is :COLON how could we ask them ?QUESTIONMARK 
but half the time ,COMMA what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go ,COMMA mmmmm ,COMMA broccoli .PERIOD 
so she'd act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted .PERIOD 
the question you might ask though is :COLON why do children learn so much ?QUESTIONMARK 
well what kind of explanation could we have for this ?QUESTIONMARK 
and essentially what bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize ,COMMA describe ,COMMA the way that scientists find out about the world .PERIOD 
and some <NUM> years ago ,COMMA i suggested that babies might be doing the same thing .PERIOD 
because if you wave a block over the top of the detector ,COMMA something you wouldn't ever think of to begin with ,COMMA the detector will actually activate two out of three times .PERIOD 
now there are two things that are really interesting about this .PERIOD 
the first one is ,COMMA again ,COMMA remember ,COMMA these are four year-olds .PERIOD 
they're just learning how to count .PERIOD 
and there's been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program .PERIOD 
i don't know .PERIOD 
not working either .PERIOD 
i think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults .PERIOD 
it's good to be a grownup .PERIOD 
that technology is simulating humans .PERIOD 
and what you can see is - it is actually a very good game .PERIOD 
i've made him run into a wall here ,COMMA over and over again .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we simulated that as well ,COMMA and then the really tricky bit is to teach that network how to walk .PERIOD 
we heard about those already yesterday ,COMMA and i suppose that most of you are familiar with that already .PERIOD 
those are then selected by the algorithm ,COMMA reproduced with mutation and recombinations to introduce sex as well .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA this might look kind of trivial ,COMMA but it's actually very important because this is not something you get at the moment in any interactive or any virtual worlds .PERIOD 
so that's what you see here .PERIOD 
we just took this character that i just talked about ,COMMA put it on a slippery surface ,COMMA and this is what you get out of it .PERIOD 
so that you don't have a character that looks limp ,COMMA but actually a character that you can use in an action film straight away ,COMMA that looks kind of alive in midair as well .PERIOD 
that's one angle ;SEMICOLON here's another angle .PERIOD 
so this is exactly the same behavior that you saw ,COMMA but in a slightly better rendered version .PERIOD 
this is incredibly quick .PERIOD this is happening in real time .PERIOD 
this is another behavior they requested .PERIOD 
you feel kind of sorry for the guy .PERIOD 
it's even worse - and that is another video i just got last night - if you render that a bit more realistically .PERIOD 
yes ,COMMA you can just about see it here .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA we've just tried and - looked at our character and asked ourselves ,COMMA can we do that ourselves as well ?QUESTIONMARK 
this was an ai contour that was produced and evolved - half-evolved ,COMMA i should say - to produce balance ,COMMA basically .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA that all happened automatically .PERIOD we didn't put that in there .PERIOD 
thanks .PERIOD 
you can draw ,COMMA as everyone should .PERIOD 
shake it ,COMMA and you have a heterosexual couple .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA i'm making a very important argument .PERIOD 
i'm making an argument that art and creativity are very essential tools in empathy .PERIOD 
say your motorcycle crashes .PERIOD 
ok .PERIOD when i was offered the times column six years ago ,COMMA the deal was like this :COLON you'll be sent the coolest ,COMMA hottest ,COMMA slickest new gadgets .PERIOD 
every week it'll arrive at your door .PERIOD 
the job ,COMMA though ,COMMA came with one small downside .PERIOD and that is :COLON they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column .PERIOD 
the guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to .PERIOD 
some of the stories are just so classic ,COMMA and yet so understandable .PERIOD 
and the technician's like ,COMMA ma'am ,COMMA you've got the mouse up against the screen ?QUESTIONMARK 
and we've arrived at the age of interface matrices ,COMMA where there are so many features and options ,COMMA you have to do two dimensions ,COMMA you know :COLON a vertical and a horizontal .PERIOD you guys all complained about how microsoft word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically .PERIOD 
it's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices .PERIOD 
so there is a limit that we don't want to cross .PERIOD so what is the answer ?QUESTIONMARK 
i'm sorry ;SEMICOLON it's not one yet .PERIOD 
you have to scroll ,COMMA like ,COMMA seven screens-full to get to it .PERIOD 
it's like a <NUM> shuttle cockpit .PERIOD 
you do not .PERIOD 
we've entered planet domination mode .PERIOD 
they're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh ,COMMA but they can't .PERIOD they're locked in because so many add-ons and other company stuff locks into the old <NUM> chassis .PERIOD 
i liked the media center pc .PERIOD i liked the microsoft spot watch .PERIOD 
the lesson was :COLON simplicity sells .PERIOD 
here's another example .PERIOD chris ,COMMA you're the source of all power .PERIOD 
in my very last example - i do a lot of my work using speech recognition software ,COMMA and you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous .PERIOD 
i also use this feature called voice macros .PERIOD period .PERIOD 
correct dissuade .PERIOD not just .PERIOD 
no new features .PERIOD it's never happened before in software !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
it could be the design of the thing you're using .PERIOD 
but i also ,COMMA in looking at more powerful technologies and nanotechnology and genetic engineering and other new emerging kind of digital technologies ,COMMA became very concerned about the potential for abuse .PERIOD 
and we can't fight the threat in the kind of stupid way we're doing ,COMMA because a million-dollar act causes a billion dollars of damage ,COMMA causes a trillion dollar response which is largely ineffective and arguably ,COMMA probably almost certainly ,COMMA has made the problem worse .PERIOD 
so after giving up on the book - and i had the great honor to be able to join kleiner perkins about a year ago ,COMMA and to work through venture capital on the innovative side ,COMMA and to try to find some innovations that could address what i saw as some of these big problems .PERIOD 
things where ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a factor of <NUM> difference can make a factor of <NUM> difference in the outcome .PERIOD 
the first is this whole area of education ,COMMA and it really relates to what nicholas was talking about with a $ <NUM> computer .PERIOD 
i think the challenge for us is - i'm very certain that that will happen ,COMMA the challenge is ,COMMA will we develop the kind of educational tools and things with the net to let us take advantage of that device ?QUESTIONMARK 
i'd argue today that we have incredibly powerful computers ,COMMA but we don't have very good software for them .PERIOD 
so given that we know and should believe - because moore's law's been ,COMMA like ,COMMA a constant ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA it's just been very predictable progress over the last <NUM> years or whatever .PERIOD 
we have a challenge ,COMMA because the urban population is growing in this century from two billion to six billion in a very short amount of time .PERIOD people are moving to the cities .PERIOD 
and these are the kinds of things we're going to discover as we start to engineer at the nano scale .PERIOD 
we believe that genentech ,COMMA the compaq ,COMMA the lotus ,COMMA the sun ,COMMA the netscape ,COMMA the amazon ,COMMA the google in these fields are yet to be found ,COMMA because this materials revolution will drive these things forward .PERIOD 
and to give you an idea of the last fund that kleiner raised was a $ <NUM> million fund ,COMMA so this for us is a very substantial fund .PERIOD 
and what we did ,COMMA over the last few months - well ,COMMA a few months ago ,COMMA ray kurzweil and i wrote an op-ed in the new york times about how publishing the <NUM> genome was very dangerous .PERIOD 
you normally get a trivalent vaccine against three possible strains .PERIOD 
we believe that if we could fill these <NUM> gaps ,COMMA we have a chance to help really reduce the risk of a pandemic .PERIOD 
so we're very excited because we think we can fund <NUM> ,COMMA or speed up <NUM> projects and see them come to market in the next couple years that will address this .PERIOD 
but above all ,COMMA what we have to do is we have to help the good guys ,COMMA the people on the defensive side ,COMMA have an advantage over the people who want to abuse things .PERIOD 
many of them are trying to kill us from the minute we go into them ,COMMA but nevertheless ,COMMA they're absolutely gripping ,COMMA and contain unbelievable biological wonders that are very ,COMMA very different from those that we have on the planet .PERIOD 
apart from the intrinsic value of the biology and mineralogy and geo-microbiology that we do there ,COMMA we're also using these as templates for figuring out how to go look for life on other planets .PERIOD 
particularly mars ,COMMA but also europa ,COMMA the small ,COMMA icy moon around jupiter .PERIOD 
we're getting ready to begin to go through the process of leaving our planet of origin and out into the wider solar system and beyond .PERIOD 
i think ,COMMA myself ,COMMA that life is a natural outgrowth of the increasing complexification of matter over time .PERIOD 
it's going to be everywhere we look - where there are planetary systems that can possibly support it .PERIOD 
so this is a very bold statement .PERIOD 
how do you know it when you find it ?QUESTIONMARK 
very critically ,COMMA how do we protect it ,COMMA if we find it ,COMMA and not contaminate it ?QUESTIONMARK 
if i were to take a swab off your teeth and plate it on a petri plate ,COMMA within about four or five hours ,COMMA i would have to see growth .PERIOD 
so they are ,COMMA intrinsically ,COMMA a slower life-form .PERIOD 
it's a very simple trick ,COMMA and i never fail to do it when i'm sitting in a window seat .PERIOD 
this is regularly several hundred parts per million .PERIOD 
and these are mineral deposits that are also made by bacteria .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA one can send a thousand of them ,COMMA as you can see in this upper left-hand picture ,COMMA a thousand of them could fit into the payload bay that was used for one of the current mer rovers .PERIOD 
the question as to whether there is life on mars that is related to life on earth has now been very muddied ,COMMA because we now know ,COMMA from mars meteorites that have made it to earth ,COMMA that there's material that can be exchanged between those two planets .PERIOD 
one of the burning questions ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is if we go there and find life in the sub-surface ,COMMA as i fully expect that we will ,COMMA is that a second genesis of life ?QUESTIONMARK 
did it start there and get transported here ?QUESTIONMARK 
this will be a fascinating puzzle as we go into the next half-century ,COMMA and where i expect that we will have more and more mars missions to answer these questions .PERIOD 
for real - you can take a second .PERIOD you've got to feel this to learn it .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA you could resist the temptation to announce your goal .PERIOD 
he wouldn't reveal the exact number of bottles ,COMMA he would not reveal exactly where the building was and he would not reveal exactly who owned the building .PERIOD 
and he ended up spending over a million dollars and hiring ex-fbi and ex-scotland yard agents to try to get to the bottom of this .PERIOD 
there are very few places in the u.s. where you can try real kobe ,COMMA and one of them is wolfgang puck's restaurant ,COMMA cut ,COMMA in los angeles .PERIOD 
it was like ,COMMA <NUM> dollars for this ?QUESTIONMARK 
and then i was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA their purpose had been served ,COMMA and so i'm afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me .PERIOD 
this is soap that's made from silver nanoparticles ,COMMA which have antibacterial properties .PERIOD 
and it ,COMMA you know ,COMMA tickled a little bit and it smelled good ,COMMA but i have to say that nobody here has complimented me on the cleanliness of my face today .PERIOD 
these ones gq did spring for - i own these - but i will tell you ,COMMA not only did i not get a compliment from any of you ,COMMA i have not gotten a compliment from anybody in the months that i have owned and worn these .PERIOD 
and then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans ,COMMA and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats' leavings then go through the forest collecting the ,COMMA you know ,COMMA results and processing it into coffee - although you actually can buy it in the unprocessed form .PERIOD 
but anyway ,COMMA we had a great night's sleep .PERIOD 
and you spend a third of your life in bed .PERIOD 
this is tom cruise arriving at the mission :COLON impossible iii premiere .PERIOD 
when he tries to open the door ,COMMA you could call it mission :COLON impossible iv .PERIOD 
there was one object that i could not get my hands on ,COMMA and that was the <NUM> cheval blanc .PERIOD 
and it was an invitation you do not refuse .PERIOD 
earlier this year ,COMMA a virtual asteroid in it sold for <NUM> real dollars .PERIOD 
and this is a titan class ship in the space game ,COMMA eve online .PERIOD 
it gives you great powers .PERIOD 
your ambition is satisfied ,COMMA but it's very beautiful .PERIOD 
and so these combine to form a very intense emotional engagement .PERIOD 
but this isn't the really interesting stuff .PERIOD 
the really interesting stuff about virtuality is what you can measure with it .PERIOD 
the game's just trying to get people to open about a million boxes ,COMMA getting better and better stuff in them .PERIOD 
this sounds immensely boring but games are able to make this process incredibly compelling .PERIOD 
but we don't just have pies in the boxes .PERIOD 
and also ,COMMA we say ,COMMA well ,COMMA how many monsters ?QUESTIONMARK should i have the entire world full of a billion monsters ?QUESTIONMARK 
they're not rational about probability .PERIOD 
it's not giving me my last two pies .PERIOD i'm going to give up .PERIOD 
and the point is really that we evolved to be satisfied by the world in particular ways .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA you give people lots and lots of different tasks .PERIOD 
third ,COMMA you reward effort .PERIOD 
and something very exciting is just beginning to happen in places like the university of bristol in the u.k. where we are beginning to be able to model mathematically dopamine levels in the brain .PERIOD 
and the success rate is at close to <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
let's start with business .PERIOD 
but each bag we'd sell would provide a year's worth of school meals for one kid .PERIOD 
all this time you're - when you think about hunger ,COMMA it's a hard thing to think about ,COMMA because what we think about is eating .PERIOD 
there's definitely hunger in america :COLON <NUM> million people and almost <NUM> million children .PERIOD 
hunger definitely means something a little bit different in america than it does internationally ,COMMA but it's incredibly important to address hunger in our own country .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA they're both about food .PERIOD 
and you know ,COMMA the reality is that between farmers in america ,COMMA who actually ,COMMA quite frankly ,COMMA when i spend time in the midwest ,COMMA are pretty large in general .PERIOD 
so the problematic food system is affecting both hunger and obesity .PERIOD 
not to beat a dead horse ,COMMA but this is a global food system where there's a billion people hungry and billion people obese .PERIOD 
and how are we going to get those kids those nutritious foods ?QUESTIONMARK 
another thing that's become incredibly global is production of meat and fish .PERIOD 
and we were going to do something that was horrible for the profession .PERIOD 
and that the incredible amount of effort to deliver those sketches for years and years and years is not only something to be derided ,COMMA but we would merely write it off as merely execution .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA there are all kinds of things that we architects need to learn how to do ,COMMA like managing contracts ,COMMA learning how to write contracts ,COMMA understanding procurement processes ,COMMA understanding the time value of money and cost estimation .PERIOD 
take joint positions with your client .PERIOD 
why was this horrible little building so important to their renown and their innovation ?QUESTIONMARK 
because they could do whatever they wanted to to this building .PERIOD 
the architectural manifestation was frankly just dumb .PERIOD 
in fact it really was the clients who had to do it .PERIOD 
they had to make a decision ,COMMA based on the positions we took to redefine the budget being from two thirds capital-a architecture and one-third infrastructure ,COMMA to actually the inverse ,COMMA two-thirds infrastructure and one-third capital-a architecture .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA that theater machine has ability to move between a whole series of configurations at the push of a button and a few stagehands in a short amount of time .PERIOD 
but it also has the potential to not only provide multiform but multi-processional sequences .PERIOD 
and some of the seats need to actually change their direction ,COMMA and change their rake ,COMMA to allow that to happen .PERIOD 
there you see it's the side balconies for the proscenium .PERIOD 
meaning ,COMMA nothing that we do can we be the first ones to do it .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA if i'll take you through - this is an early concept sketch - take you through kind of a mixture of all these things together .PERIOD 
you would be allowed to bring objects or performers into the performing chamber :COLON aida ,COMMA their elephants ,COMMA you can bring the elephants in .PERIOD 
et voila .PERIOD 
this is the at & amp ;SEMICOLON t performing arts center's dee and charles wyly theater .PERIOD 
but we got to that conclusion without understanding where we were going ,COMMA what we knew were a series of issues that the company and the client was confronted with .PERIOD 
so this is a picture of me holding one of the first watercolor paintings i ever made .PERIOD 
i have many of these books ,COMMA and i've been keeping them for about the last eight or nine years .PERIOD 
and i really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody's life .PERIOD 
as opposed to knowing the whole story ,COMMA just knowing a little bit of the story ,COMMA and then letting your own mind fill in the rest .PERIOD 
this is a project that scans the world's newly posted blog entries every two or three minutes ,COMMA searching for occurrences of the phrases i feel and i am feeling .PERIOD and when it finds one of those phrases ,COMMA it grabs the full sentence up to the period and also tries to identify demographic information about the author .PERIOD 
and when that happens ,COMMA these montage compositions are automatically created ,COMMA which consist of the sentence and images being combined .PERIOD 
i'm <NUM> ,COMMA and a recovering meth and heroin addict ,COMMA and feel absolutely blessed to still be alive .PERIOD 
i feel sassy .PERIOD 
as you can see ,COMMA we feel fine collects very ,COMMA very small-scale personal stories .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA really even challenging the notion of what can be considered a story .PERIOD 
and the eskimo community basically camps out on the edge of the ice here ,COMMA waits for a whale to come close enough to attack .PERIOD and when it does ,COMMA it throws a harpoon at it ,COMMA and then hauls the whale up under the ice ,COMMA and cuts it up .PERIOD 
they have colors .PERIOD what do they look like ?QUESTIONMARK 
this is in the patkotak's family living room in their house in barrow .PERIOD the boxed wine they served us .PERIOD

so ,COMMA you have some really happy person holding <NUM> balloons ,COMMA and some really sad soul holding one balloon .PERIOD 
a 16-year-old student .PERIOD 
i asked her about that ,COMMA and she said she meant that she doesn't want to be married ,COMMA because ,COMMA in her opinion ,COMMA when you get married in bhutan as a woman ,COMMA your chances to live an independent life kind of end ,COMMA and so she had no interest in that .PERIOD 
a 37-year-old road worker .PERIOD 
his wish was to make some money and open a store .PERIOD 
finally ,COMMA this is a 26-year-old nun i spoke to .PERIOD 
i asked her a little bit more about the cave and what she planned would happen once she went there ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
jonathan harris :COLON maybe you'll die ?QUESTIONMARK woman :COLON yes .PERIOD 
yeah ,COMMA but - yeah ,COMMA ok. do you hope - would you prefer to live in the cave for <NUM> years ,COMMA or to live for one year ?QUESTIONMARK 
woman :COLON yes .PERIOD from then ,COMMA i'm going to the heaven .PERIOD 
you can start to see some familiar balloons here .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA the approach that we took was the other way around .PERIOD 
what you see here is a prototypic device .PERIOD 
it's made of paper and paper ,COMMA of course ,COMMA wicks fluid ,COMMA as you know ,COMMA paper ,COMMA cloth - drop wine on the tablecloth ,COMMA and the wine wicks all over everything .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA the production capability is there .PERIOD 
and the procedure that we have is simply to start with paper .PERIOD 
you can't manipulate it very well ,COMMA although i'll show something about that in a moment .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA you take the drop of blood ,COMMA no further manipulations ,COMMA you put it on a little device ,COMMA the device filters out the blood cells ,COMMA lets the serum go through ,COMMA and you get a series of colors down in the bottom there .PERIOD 
turns out to work actually quite well ,COMMA particularly when your color printer has printed the color bars that indicate how things work .PERIOD 
i don't know whether the idea of one computer ,COMMA one child makes any sense .PERIOD here's the computer of the future ,COMMA because this screen is already there and they're ubiquitous .PERIOD 
the answer is that what you do ,COMMA and the details are not terribly important here ,COMMA is to make something more elaborate :COLON you take several different layers of paper ,COMMA each one containing its own little fluid system ,COMMA and you separate them by pieces of ,COMMA literally ,COMMA double-sided carpet tape ,COMMA the stuff you use to stick the carpets onto the floor .PERIOD 
but that is ,COMMA in principle ,COMMA the way you solve the fever of unexplained origin problem ,COMMA because each one of those spots then becomes a test for a particular set of markers of disease ,COMMA and this will work in due course .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i have one last ,COMMA two last little stories to tell you ,COMMA in finishing off this business .PERIOD 
we were very proud of this ,COMMA particularly the title ,COMMA which was eggbeater as centrifuge .PERIOD 
we all struggled for an entire day to think about simplicity .PERIOD 
why are we spending $ <NUM> billion ?QUESTIONMARK 
in the fourth act ,COMMA with our hubris ,COMMA our overconfidence developing ,COMMA we invaded iraq and afghanistan ,COMMA and in the fifth act ,COMMA we plunged into a humiliating mess .PERIOD 
when i walked across afghanistan in the winter of <NUM> ,COMMA what i saw was scenes like this .PERIOD 
in sangin where i was sick in <NUM> ,COMMA the nearest health clinic was within three days walk .PERIOD 
and the same is true for the troops .PERIOD 
and the reason i'm looking a little bit perplexed in this photograph is i was somewhat frightened ,COMMA and i was too afraid on this occasion to ask him ,COMMA having run for an hour through the desert and taken refuge in this house ,COMMA why he had turned up and wanted to have his photograph taken with me .PERIOD 
now this is not to say afghanistan is a place full of people like mullah mustafa .PERIOD 
i ran a center at harvard from <NUM> to <NUM> ,COMMA and there were people like michael semple there who speak afghan languages fluently ,COMMA who've traveled to almost every district in the country .PERIOD 
you feel deep ,COMMA deep guilt .PERIOD 
the average british soldier is on a tour of only six months ;SEMICOLON italian soldiers ,COMMA on tours of four months ;SEMICOLON the american military ,COMMA on tours of <NUM> months .PERIOD

borders between the bosniak territory and the bosnian-serb territory have calmed down .PERIOD 
if what we're interested in is regional stability ,COMMA egypt is far more important .PERIOD 
just briefly ,COMMA what's your take on the current events there and the intervention ?QUESTIONMARK 
what we should have done in libya is we should have stuck to the u.n. resolution .PERIOD 
for the first time in the united states ,COMMA a predominantly white group of voters voted for an african-american candidate for president .PERIOD 
but really the question here - obama did relatively well in kansas .PERIOD 
actually we didn't ask them ,COMMA but when they conducted exit polls in every state ,COMMA in <NUM> states ,COMMA out of the <NUM> ,COMMA they asked a question ,COMMA that was pretty direct ,COMMA about race .PERIOD 
and they ask a series of really interesting questions .PERIOD 
but you see democrats versus republican ,COMMA not a big difference based on who your neighbors are .PERIOD 
and likewise they asked ,COMMA not in <NUM> ,COMMA but in the same survey in <NUM> ,COMMA would you not vote for a qualified black president ?QUESTIONMARK 
i'm a big fan of cities .PERIOD

it was an offering ,COMMA an invitation .PERIOD 
it's the - it's produced by the quadro corporation of west virginia .PERIOD 
you could dowse for all sorts of things ,COMMA but this particular one was built to dowse for marijuana in students' lockers .PERIOD 
so the way it works is ,COMMA you go down the hallway and you see if it tilts toward a particular locker ,COMMA and then you open the locker .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA it - well ,COMMA it has kind of a right-leaning bias .PERIOD 
you can say a miracle occurs .PERIOD 
whereas - and it's true ,COMMA scientists sometimes throw terms out as linguistic place fillers - dark energy or dark matter or something like that - until we figure out what it is ,COMMA we'll just call it this - it's the beginning of the causal chain for science .PERIOD 
you don't even need photoshop ;SEMICOLON you don't need high-tech equipment ;SEMICOLON you don't need computers .PERIOD 
in the case of galileo ,COMMA he had two problems when he turned his telescope to saturn .PERIOD

and so ,COMMA you're reducing the quality of your data .PERIOD 
virgin mary in clearwater ,COMMA florida .PERIOD 
here's the virgin mary on the backside ,COMMA which they started to wipe off .PERIOD

in america it would be ,COMMA we're <NUM> light years from the edge .PERIOD 
and so if we can do that ,COMMA then we can free up resources for buying drugs that you really do need for treating aids and hiv and malaria and for preventing avian flu .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD 
that is the primary function of an incubator .PERIOD 
and then we thought of the most simple solution we could to address this problem .PERIOD 
he connected with people who cared about this :COLON nonprofessionals ,COMMA people with passion .PERIOD 
henry ford comes up with a really cool idea .PERIOD

the beatles did not invent teenagers .PERIOD 
she didn't invent the idea of caring about this issue .PERIOD 
i see what the status quo is ;SEMICOLON i don't like it .PERIOD 
someone stands up and says ,COMMA this one is important .PERIOD 
because if you're not upsetting anyone ,COMMA you're not changing the status quo .PERIOD 
because focusing on that part of it - not the mechanics of what you're building ,COMMA but the who ,COMMA and the leading part - is where change comes .PERIOD 
so here is what leaders have in common .PERIOD the first thing is ,COMMA they challenge the status quo .PERIOD 
the second thing is ,COMMA they build a culture .PERIOD

it would have been impossible without recorded music as well .PERIOD 
and he's singing right into your ear .PERIOD 
he's whispering into your ears .PERIOD 
now there's venues like this ,COMMA a discotheque ,COMMA and there's jukeboxes in bars ,COMMA where you don't even need to have a band .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA as with jazz ,COMMA the dancers liked certain sections more than they did others .PERIOD 
so that doesn't really work .PERIOD 
and it turns out that a sound like this is the most energy efficient and practical way to transmit their call across the fields and savannahs .PERIOD 
it's adaptive .PERIOD 
and i'm saying ,COMMA well ,COMMA the passion's still there ,COMMA but the vessel that it's going to be injected into and poured into ,COMMA that is instinctively and intuitively created first .PERIOD 
we sing .PERIOD 
and like the birds ,COMMA the joy is still there ,COMMA even though we have changed what we do to fit the context .PERIOD 
as a clergyman ,COMMA you can imagine how out of place i feel .PERIOD

one out of four south bronx children has asthma .PERIOD 
residents were often given less than a month's notice before their buildings were razed .PERIOD 
the common perception was that only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the south bronx .PERIOD 
and luckily for me ,COMMA that home and the love inside of it ,COMMA along with help from teachers ,COMMA mentors and friends along the way ,COMMA was enough .PERIOD 
are these factors taken into consideration when land-use policy is decided ?QUESTIONMARK 
once we realized that ,COMMA we decided it was time to do our own planning .PERIOD

in the post-katrina era ,COMMA we have still more in common .PERIOD 
neither the destruction of the ninth ward nor the south bronx was inevitable .PERIOD 
at present ,COMMA that's not happening in new york city .PERIOD 
and although less than <NUM> percent of south bronx residents own cars ,COMMA these projects include thousands of new parking spaces ,COMMA yet zip in terms of mass public transit .PERIOD 
i do have a problem with developments that hyper-exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit .PERIOD 
but one of the things i do to remind myself of greater possibilities is to learn from visionaries in other cities .PERIOD 
he looked at the demographics .PERIOD 
his administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three ,COMMA outlawed parking on those streets ,COMMA expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes ,COMMA created public plazas ,COMMA created one of the most efficient bus mass-transit systems in the entire world .PERIOD 
i don't think he understood that i wasn't asking for funding .PERIOD 
this is more or less what we saw last year ,COMMA and this is how it will go on into the future .PERIOD

it's a cultural expression that for thousands of years has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious .PERIOD

now at this point you're going to see a picture of michelangelo .PERIOD 
automobiles are self-moving things ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK elevators are automobiles .PERIOD 
cars are a sculpture - did you know this ?QUESTIONMARK 
ok ,COMMA it's not marketing ;SEMICOLON there's a very interesting car concept here ,COMMA but the marketing part is not what i want to talk about here .PERIOD 
it's that will to live ,COMMA that need to survive ,COMMA to express itself ,COMMA that comes in a car ,COMMA and takes over people like me .PERIOD 
and we tell other people ,COMMA do this ,COMMA do this ,COMMA do this ,COMMA until this thing comes alive .PERIOD 
we are completely infected .PERIOD and beauty can be the result of this infectiousness ;SEMICOLON it's quite wonderful .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA now i get to the point .PERIOD i want to talk about cars as art .PERIOD 
we're not trying to find vanity and beauty .PERIOD 
and that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence in why we're doing what we're doing .PERIOD 
toothbrush ,COMMA cool .PERIOD 
i heard today about joseph's death genes that have to go in and kill cell reproduction .PERIOD 
this is very difficult ,COMMA and you have to have a bond with your team that permits you to do this ,COMMA because their life is wrapped up in that too .PERIOD 
this is <NUM> we did this project .PERIOD and so we sent them off with this team name ,COMMA deep blue .PERIOD now many people know deep blue from ibm - we actually stole it from them because we figured if anybody read our faxes they'd think we're talking about computers .PERIOD 
and a group of engineers worked in germany ,COMMA and the idea was they would work separately on this problem of what's the successor to the suv .PERIOD 
they would come together ,COMMA compare notes .PERIOD then they would work apart ,COMMA come together ,COMMA and they would produce together a monumental set of diverse opinions that didn't pollute each other's ideas - but at the same time came together and resolved the problems .PERIOD 
the bathroom was so big ,COMMA she built the bed over the bathtub - it's quite fascinating .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA what i didn't know was ,COMMA and what we found out was - these guys ,COMMA they can't even like talk to each other under those conditions .PERIOD 
there was a whole lot of dialog .PERIOD 
we spent four hours being told all about vocabulary that needs to be built between engineers and designers .PERIOD 
dialog kept on going ,COMMA with mental maps of words ,COMMA and pretty soon it was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance ,COMMA i was seriously being baffled with bullshit .PERIOD 
because of course they didn't tell us that they had three station wagons full of drawings ,COMMA model concepts ,COMMA pictures - everything i wanted ,COMMA they'd locked up in the cars ,COMMA because they had shown solidarity with the engineers - and they'd decided not to show me anything ,COMMA in order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start ,COMMA because they hadn't realized ,COMMA of course ,COMMA that they couldn't do problem creating .PERIOD 
it's true that the trust and the love ,COMMA that makes it worthwhile .PERIOD 
we didn't sequence his genome .PERIOD 
and the reason is that cancer ,COMMA like every cell in the body ,COMMA places little molecular bookmarks ,COMMA little post-it notes ,COMMA that remind the cell i'm cancer ;SEMICOLON i should keep growing .PERIOD 
we just started mailing it to our friends .PERIOD 
and as we treat it with our compound ,COMMA this addiction to sugar ,COMMA this rapid growth ,COMMA faded .PERIOD 
and in fact ,COMMA this molecule prevents this adipocyte ,COMMA this fat stem cell ,COMMA from remembering how to make fat such that mice on a high fat diet ,COMMA like the folks in my hometown of chicago ,COMMA fail to develop fatty liver ,COMMA which is a major medical problem .PERIOD 
this molecule will soon leave our benches and go into a small startup company called tensha therapeutics .PERIOD 
i've never seen really anywhere this unique support for cancer research .PERIOD 
the age of the universe ,COMMA between now and the big bang ,COMMA is a hundred billion in dog years .PERIOD 
if you looked at one of these galaxies and measured its velocity ,COMMA it would be moving away from you .PERIOD 
and if you look at a galaxy even farther away ,COMMA it would be moving away faster .PERIOD 
that kind of makes sense to us .PERIOD 
the air in this room is very smooth .PERIOD 
in particular ,COMMA things were a lot denser .PERIOD 
what you have to think about is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies ,COMMA a hundred billion stars each .PERIOD 
we'd like to understand that .PERIOD 
one of the people who did understand that this was a problem was richard feynman .PERIOD 
the arrow of time cannot be completely understood until the mystery of the beginnings of the history of the universe are reduced still further from speculation to understanding .PERIOD 
it's not true that we've figured it out by now .PERIOD 
the reason the problem has gotten worse ,COMMA rather than better ,COMMA is because in <NUM> we learned something crucial about the universe that we didn't know before .PERIOD 
and so even though the universe will last forever ,COMMA and ordinary matter and radiation will dilute away ,COMMA there will always be some radiation ,COMMA some thermal fluctuations ,COMMA even in empty space .PERIOD 
it will probably increase ,COMMA and the probability is enormously huge .PERIOD 
remember ,COMMA life itself depends on the arrow of time .PERIOD 
occasionally ,COMMA you will make a planet or a star or a galaxy or a hundred billion galaxies .PERIOD 
now your homework assignment is to really think about this ,COMMA to contemplate what it means .PERIOD 
i just showed you this picture .PERIOD 
they all happen over a period of time equal to <NUM> to the <NUM> to the <NUM> years .PERIOD 
so here's two questions for you .PERIOD 
maybe there is something that naturally ,COMMA through the growth of the laws of physics ,COMMA gives rise to universe like ours in low entropy configurations .PERIOD 
my bold speculation is that i will be absolutely vindicated by history .PERIOD 
and <NUM> years from now ,COMMA all of my current wild ideas will be accepted as truths by the scientific and external communities .PERIOD 
this is a prediction .PERIOD i might be wrong .PERIOD 
i would like to share that story today .PERIOD 
like everyone else ,COMMA we grew maize .PERIOD 
i felt very happy to be at the secondary school ,COMMA so i was determined to do anything possible to receive education .PERIOD 
so i went to a library .PERIOD 
so i would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the africans ,COMMA and the poor who are struggling with your dreams .PERIOD 
god bless .PERIOD 
unlike most of our computing devices ,COMMA these objects are much more fun to use .PERIOD 
a gesture of namaste !EXCLAMATIONMARK maybe ,COMMA to respect someone ,COMMA or maybe - in india i don't need to teach a kid that this means four runs in cricket .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i was interested in these two rollers ,COMMA and i actually wanted more ,COMMA so i borrowed another mouse from a friend - never returned to him - and i now had four rollers .PERIOD 
what i got is basically a gesture interface device that actually acts as a motion-sensing device made for two dollars .PERIOD 
what we are interested in is information .PERIOD 
so i thought ,COMMA around last year - in the beginning of the last year - i started thinking ,COMMA why can i not take this approach in the reverse way ?QUESTIONMARK 
but later ,COMMA i realized that i actually wanted to interact with those digital pixels ,COMMA also .PERIOD 
you stop by a wall ,COMMA and start painting on that wall .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA technically ,COMMA it's a little bit complex ,COMMA but it gives you an output which is more intuitive to use ,COMMA in some sense .PERIOD 
rather than getting your camera out of your pocket ,COMMA you can just do the gesture of taking a photo and it takes a photo for you .PERIOD 
once it has that information ,COMMA it finds out more reviews about that ,COMMA or maybe new york times has a sound overview on that ,COMMA so you can actually hear ,COMMA on a physical book ,COMMA a review as sound .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what i did here is remove the camera - all the webcam cameras have a microphone inside the camera .PERIOD 
yeah .PERIOD and i say ,COMMA ok ,COMMA this looks nice ,COMMA let me print it out ,COMMA that thing .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
this is incredible ,COMMA really .PERIOD 
and now ,COMMA if you see ,COMMA it's more about the cost-effectiveness :COLON this system costs you $ <NUM> compared to the $ <NUM> surface tables ,COMMA or anything like that .PERIOD 
or maybe even the $ <NUM> mouse gesture system at that time was costing around $ <NUM> ?QUESTIONMARK 
no ,COMMA this theory comes from an expert on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding ,COMMA and you know who i mean :COLON charles darwin .PERIOD 
taste for both natural beauty and for the arts travel across cultures with great ease .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i personally have no doubt whatsoever that the experience of beauty ,COMMA with its emotional intensity and pleasure ,COMMA belongs to our evolved human psychology .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA keeping these ideas firmly in mind ,COMMA we can say that the experience of beauty is one of the ways that evolution has of arousing and sustaining interest or fascination ,COMMA even obsession ,COMMA in order to encourage us toward making the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction .PERIOD 
beauty is nature's way of acting at a distance ,COMMA so to speak .PERIOD 
consider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure ,COMMA the magnetic pull of beautiful landscapes .PERIOD 
their symmetry ,COMMA their attractive materials and ,COMMA above all ,COMMA their meticulous workmanship are simply quite beautiful to our eyes ,COMMA even today .PERIOD 
competently made hand axes indicated desirable personal qualities - intelligence ,COMMA fine motor control ,COMMA planning ability ,COMMA conscientiousness and sometimes access to rare materials .PERIOD 
so before i talk about this car for the blind ,COMMA let me briefly tell you about another project that i worked on called the darpa urban challenge .PERIOD 
now this was about building a robotic car that can drive itself .PERIOD 
so it's a small tablet ,COMMA has many holes in it ,COMMA and compressed air comes out ,COMMA so it can actually draw images .PERIOD 
so since we started this project ,COMMA we've been getting hundreds of letters ,COMMA emails ,COMMA phone calls from people from all around the world .PERIOD 
but potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the spin-off technology that can come from this project .PERIOD 
why do we call it that ?QUESTIONMARK 
i don't know ,COMMA taiwan straits <NUM> .PERIOD 
let's talk about an enemy embedded within that battle space .PERIOD 
they said we couldn't do iraq .PERIOD 
you have to create internal partners .PERIOD you have to access coalition partners .PERIOD 
we asked the russians for <NUM> .PERIOD 
they said no .PERIOD 
like saddam ,COMMA like mugabe ,COMMA like kim jong-il - people who kill in hundreds of thousands or millions .PERIOD 
like the <NUM> dead so far in sudan .PERIOD 
and let's call this red line ,COMMA i don't know ,COMMA mission accomplished .PERIOD 
what we need downstream is a great power enabled - what i call that sys admin force .PERIOD 
you've got to track coalition partners .PERIOD create a record of success .PERIOD 
so they start moving from reality towards desire and they create their own special language to describe their voyage of self-discovery and self-actualization .PERIOD 
we bought one military and we operated another .PERIOD 
i used to give this brief inside the pentagon in the early <NUM> .PERIOD 
bad pentagon ,COMMA bad !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
it elevates mootw - how we pronounce that acronym - from crap to grand strategy ,COMMA because that's how you're going to shrink that gap .PERIOD 
a department of war ,COMMA a department of everything else .PERIOD 
our long-term rationale becomes ,COMMA we're involved in a hair trigger stand off with the soviets .PERIOD 
the question is how do we reconnect american national security with global security to make the world a lot more comfortable ,COMMA and to embed and contextualize our employment of force around the planet ?QUESTIONMARK 
just be grateful robert reed didn't shove that bomb up his ass .PERIOD 
i love this force .PERIOD i don't want to see it go .PERIOD 
what does this mean in terms of operations ?QUESTIONMARK 
the force on the right ,COMMA in and out .PERIOD 
the force on the right's going to obliterate it .PERIOD 
different definitions of network centricity .PERIOD 
but ultimately you're going to civilianize it ,COMMA probably two thirds .PERIOD 
but you need lots of these guys on the ground to win the peace .PERIOD 
the point about the trigger-pullers and special operations command .PERIOD 
see me now .PERIOD don't talk about it later .PERIOD 
the world is my playground .PERIOD 
i want the rules to be as loose as possible .PERIOD 
the town was burned down ;SEMICOLON it was in the middle of winter ,COMMA and it was a very ,COMMA very severe winter .PERIOD 
and that's what we're going through at this time .PERIOD 
i wanted to just talk for one minute about the future of biotechnology ,COMMA because i think i know very little about that - i'm not a biologist - so everything i know about it can be said in one minute .PERIOD 
but that's hard to do .PERIOD unfortunately ,COMMA the ice is thick .PERIOD 
but we can look outside ,COMMA very cheaply and in a simple fashion .PERIOD 
and the step from the ocean to the land was not easy ,COMMA but it happened .PERIOD 
so they would have to have something like a reptilian skin .PERIOD 
the sunlight in jupiter ,COMMA on the satellites of jupiter ,COMMA is <NUM> times fainter than it is here ,COMMA since jupiter is five times as far from the sun .PERIOD 
this was - originally ,COMMA when radio astronomy began ,COMMA mr. jansky ,COMMA at the bell labs ,COMMA detected radio waves coming from the sky .PERIOD 
since there was nothing there ,COMMA you might as well not look .PERIOD 
there is something called pit lamping .PERIOD 
so these creatures will be bright against the cold surroundings .PERIOD 
i call these creatures sunflowers .PERIOD 
if we don't find them ,COMMA then we can create them ourselves .PERIOD 
in the long run ,COMMA of course ,COMMA it would also make it possible for us to move out there .PERIOD 
but in the long run ,COMMA if there's no life there ,COMMA we create it ourselves .PERIOD 
so again ,COMMA we have a big and wonderful future to look forward .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
and i realized then i had to go to design school .PERIOD 
or what's this num lock key for ?QUESTIONMARK you know ,COMMA that thing ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i didn't want to be a colorist .PERIOD 
and that allows me to check my timer discretely ,COMMA here ,COMMA without bending my elbow .PERIOD 
and something a little bit more experimental :COLON this is a light fixture for swarovski ,COMMA and what it does is ,COMMA it changes shape .PERIOD 
and the new experience i was looking for is giving the choice for the user to go from a warm ,COMMA sort of glowing kind of mood light ,COMMA all the way to a bright work light .PERIOD 
i want to point at something here ,COMMA on the left .PERIOD 
and this allows the bottle to turn into a game .PERIOD 
the bottles connect together ,COMMA and you can create different shapes ,COMMA different forms .PERIOD 
and then the integration of all these great technologies ,COMMA which you've heard about ,COMMA the wi-fi antennas that allow the kids to connect ;SEMICOLON the screen ,COMMA which you can read in sunlight ;SEMICOLON the keyboard ,COMMA which is made out of rubber ,COMMA and it's protected from the environment .PERIOD 
and if anybody asks why you're carrying a condom ,COMMA you can just say you like the design .PERIOD 
much of my life has been a quest to get some answers to these questions .PERIOD 
i was born and raised here in india ,COMMA and i learned from an early age to be deeply suspicious of the aunties and uncles who would bend down ,COMMA pat us on the head and then say to my parents with no problem at all ,COMMA poor things .PERIOD you only have three daughters .PERIOD 
late that night ,COMMA i heard my mother begging my father ,COMMA please do something ramu .PERIOD can't you intervene ?QUESTIONMARK 
this is tradition .PERIOD 
she said to me ,COMMA it is not about the burka .PERIOD 
had i heard right ?QUESTIONMARK 
she is on the taliban's hit list .PERIOD 
their path is their own and it looks towards an afghanistan that will be different .PERIOD 
their repertoire includes the croatian national anthem ,COMMA a bosnian love song and serbian duets .PERIOD 
in the middle ages ,COMMA troubadours would travel across the land singing their tales and sharing their verses :COLON lesbor travels through the balkans like this ,COMMA singing ,COMMA connecting people divided by religion ,COMMA nationality and language .PERIOD 
the world layma bowie was given was a world at war .PERIOD 
at the next friday sermon ,COMMA the women who were sitting in the side room of the mosque began to share their distress at the state of affairs .PERIOD 
in a now famous cnn clip ,COMMA you can see them sitting on the ground ,COMMA their arms linked .PERIOD 
the police are called in to physically remove the women .PERIOD 
and then you realize that by integrating aspects of tradition and community into their struggles ,COMMA women like sakena and leah and layma - but also women like sonia gandhi here in india and michelle bachelet in chile and shirin ebadi in iran - are doing something else .PERIOD 
and the first thing i wanted to do as a muslim was go to mecca and visit the kaaba ,COMMA the holiest shrine of islam .PERIOD 
and i did that ;SEMICOLON i put on my ritualistic dress ;SEMICOLON i went to the holy mosque ;SEMICOLON i did my prayers ;SEMICOLON i observed all the rituals .PERIOD 
in other words ,COMMA men and women were worshiping all together .PERIOD 
and i think it's not an accident that you don't find this idea in the very origin of islam .PERIOD 
on the other hand ,COMMA the westerners who look at islamic culture and see some troubling aspects should not readily conclude that this is what islam ordains .PERIOD 
and the religious police imposes the supposed islamic way of life on every citizen ,COMMA by force - like women are forced to cover their heads - wear the hijab ,COMMA the islamic head cover .PERIOD 
let me give you an example :COLON in turkey where i come from ,COMMA which is a very hyper-secular republic ,COMMA until very recently we used to have what i call secularism police ,COMMA which would guard the universities against veiled students .PERIOD 
in other words ,COMMA they would force students to uncover their heads ,COMMA and i think forcing people to uncover their head is as tyrannical as forcing them to cover it .PERIOD 
which means that muslims can ,COMMA today ,COMMA look at those things and say ,COMMA well ,COMMA the core of our religion is here to stay with us .PERIOD 
and even the very extreme forms of islamism led to terrorism in the name of islam - which is actually a practice that i think is against islam ,COMMA but some ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA extremists did not think that way .PERIOD 
and i think the west ,COMMA at least some powers in the west ,COMMA particularly the united states ,COMMA made the mistake of supporting those secular dictators ,COMMA thinking that they were more helpful for their interests .PERIOD 
secondly ,COMMA in the past two decades ,COMMA thanks to globalization ,COMMA thanks to the market economy ,COMMA thanks to the rise of a middle-class ,COMMA we in turkey see what i define as a rebirth of islamic modernism .PERIOD 
as a photographer for national geographic ,COMMA i've portrayed it for many .PERIOD 
and where that energy touches water ,COMMA something new emerges :COLON life .PERIOD 
shallow seas nurtured life early on ,COMMA and that's where it morphed into more complex forms .PERIOD 
the fundamental forms of ferns followed ,COMMA to bear spores that foreshadowed seeds .PERIOD 
leatherbacks and tuataras are echoes from that era .PERIOD 
jurassic park still shimmers in part of madagascar ,COMMA and the center of brazil ,COMMA where plants called cycads remain rock hard .PERIOD 
flamingos covered continents .PERIOD migrations got underway .PERIOD 
water lilies were among the first .PERIOD 
in africa ,COMMA gondwana molded proteas .PERIOD 
tropical rainforests arose ,COMMA sparking new layers of interdependence .PERIOD 
a trick shared by the largest flower on earth .PERIOD 
an asteroid hits ,COMMA and the world went down in flames .PERIOD 
primates emerge from jungles ,COMMA as tarsiers first ,COMMA becoming lemurs not much later .PERIOD 
and you all here today can imagine and will shape where we go next .PERIOD 
today i want to talk to you about ethnic conflict and civil war .PERIOD 
but let's start at the beginning .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA notwithstanding the gloomy pictures from the middle east ,COMMA darfur ,COMMA iraq ,COMMA elsewhere ,COMMA there is a longer-term trend that does represent some good news .PERIOD 
the news about civilian casualties is also less bad than it used to be .PERIOD 
thus ,COMMA even though every civilian killed ,COMMA maimed ,COMMA raped ,COMMA or tortured is one too many ,COMMA the fact that the number of civilian casualties is clearly lower today than it was a decade ago ,COMMA is good news .PERIOD 
but let's look at the good news again .PERIOD 
but then ,COMMA is northern ireland a unique example ,COMMA or does this kind of explanation only hold more generally in democratic and developed countries ?QUESTIONMARK 
a final example :COLON kosovo .PERIOD 
central among them are three .PERIOD 
by the same token - and here we have some good news again - the very fact that there is a high-level ,COMMA well-resourced international presence in kosovo and the balkans region more generally and the fact that local leaders on both sides have showed relative restraint ,COMMA explains why things have not been worse over the past two years since <NUM> .PERIOD 
a final thought :COLON ending civil wars is a process that is fraught with dangers ,COMMA frustrations and setbacks .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
i'm going to talk about some of my discoveries around the world through my work .PERIOD 
and at that young age ,COMMA <NUM> years old ,COMMA benki became the paje of his community .PERIOD 
he went <NUM> miles on an odyssey to rio to the earth summit to tell the world what was happening in his tiny ,COMMA little corner .PERIOD 
benki came back to his village full of ideas - new technologies ,COMMA new research ,COMMA new ways of understanding what was going on .PERIOD 
he's built schools to teach children to care for the forest .PERIOD 
together ,COMMA he's led the reforestation of over <NUM> percent of the land that had been destroyed by the loggers .PERIOD 
why are you putting yourself at risk ?QUESTIONMARK 
so when i think of that ,COMMA i wonder what our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren ,COMMA when they ask themselves that question ,COMMA i wonder how they will answer .PERIOD 
for me ,COMMA the world is veering towards a future we don't much want when we really think about it deep inside .PERIOD 
you also know that we can't just keep doing what we've always done ,COMMA because we'll get the results we've always gotten .PERIOD 
we have to change .PERIOD 
it's imperative to me ,COMMA when i look around the world ,COMMA that we need to change ourselves .PERIOD 
sanghamitra didn't start life as a leader of an ngo ,COMMA she started her career as university professor ,COMMA teaching english literature .PERIOD 
they take care of <NUM> people today in over <NUM> villages around karnataka .PERIOD 
they've pioneered a different approach to villages .PERIOD 
instead of handing out information in pamphlets ,COMMA as is so often the case ,COMMA they bring theater troupes ,COMMA songs ,COMMA music ,COMMA dance .PERIOD 
sanghamitra told me just last week - she had just come back from two weeks in the villages ,COMMA and she had a real breakthrough .PERIOD 
he has nine other buildings - that are already open to the public - filled to the rafters with artifacts documenting contemporary chinese history .PERIOD 
they looked outside ,COMMA and then they changed what was on the inside .PERIOD 
they've gone away from what they did before ,COMMA and they've gone to something they didn't know .PERIOD 
he went around once ,COMMA he went around twice ,COMMA he went around thrice .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA when you study it ,COMMA you realize that different people of the world have a different understanding of the world .PERIOD 
perhaps he was a jain monk ,COMMA like bahubali over here ,COMMA the gomateshwara bahubali whose image is not far from mysore .PERIOD 
alexander asked ,COMMA what are you doing ?QUESTIONMARK 
and they both laughed .PERIOD 
what should you not be ?QUESTIONMARK 
you should not be sisyphus ,COMMA who rolls a rock up a mountain all day only to find the boulder rolled down at night .PERIOD 
and he wanted to hoist his flag to say ,COMMA i was here first .PERIOD 
this was the mythology of the gymnosophist .PERIOD 
but they were not two characters on two different adventures .PERIOD 
you see ,COMMA the indians also had a river that separates the land of the living from the land of the dead .PERIOD 
you go again and again and again .PERIOD 
two different mythologies ,COMMA two different ways of looking at the world .PERIOD 
and i believe it is this mythological paradigm that inspired indian mathematicians to discover the number zero .PERIOD 
who knows ?QUESTIONMARK 
standard business model :COLON vision ,COMMA mission ,COMMA values ,COMMA processes .PERIOD 
you see ,COMMA this is what india is today .PERIOD the ground reality is based on a cyclical world view .PERIOD 
i have personally experienced it .PERIOD i'm trained as a medical doctor .PERIOD 
and he knew very intuitively ,COMMA that best practices ,COMMA developed in japan and china and europe and america will not work in india .PERIOD 
you can't measure it .PERIOD you can't manage it .PERIOD 
after a leader completes his training and is about to take over the store ,COMMA we blindfold him ,COMMA we surround him with the stakeholders ,COMMA the customer ,COMMA his family ,COMMA his team ,COMMA his boss .PERIOD 
that sensitivity is what we need .PERIOD once this belief enters ,COMMA behavior will happen ,COMMA business will happen .PERIOD 
but that was interesting in itself .PERIOD this is companies like vonage .PERIOD 
the little box has your phone number .PERIOD 
it's really cute seeing middle-aged people like me ,COMMA try out skype for the first time ,COMMA which is usually when their kid goes away for a semester abroad .PERIOD 
they don't want to pay the international fees ,COMMA so they're like ,COMMA timmy !EXCLAMATIONMARK is that you ?QUESTIONMARK 
imagine if you had an ordinary cell phone ,COMMA and any time you were in a wireless hotspot - free calls anywhere in the world ,COMMA never pay the cellular company a nickel .PERIOD 
and when you're out of the hotspot ,COMMA you're on the regular cellular network .PERIOD 
you're thinking ,COMMA well ,COMMA how often am i in a hotspot ?QUESTIONMARK 
because they give you a regular wireless router that works with the phone ,COMMA for your house .PERIOD 
they don't have that kind of money .PERIOD instead they give each of us a seven-dollar-and-95-cent box .PERIOD they're like a stealth tower installation program .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i'm leaving the house .PERIOD dp :COLON i'm going for a walk - do you mind ?QUESTIONMARK 
i don't know why my wife says i never listen to her .PERIOD i don't get that .PERIOD 
i have two cellphones ,COMMA so this going to be very odd ,COMMA if it works .PERIOD 
excuse me one second .PERIOD 
all right !EXCLAMATIONMARK we've made the point .PERIOD 
the beauty of that is you never miss a call .PERIOD 
google bought it ,COMMA and they've been working on it for a year .PERIOD 
i actually got a photograph of the verizon employee right there .PERIOD 
anyway ,COMMA so lets say you need a drugstore near chicago .PERIOD 
here it comes .PERIOD 
and it's already written down - so ,COMMA like ,COMMA if you're driving ,COMMA you don't have to do one of these things ,COMMA uh huh ,COMMA uh huh ,COMMA uh huh .PERIOD 
shortly i'll tell you why i was in milan .PERIOD 
that's cute .PERIOD i do have an email address .PERIOD you can just ask me .PERIOD 
it's absolutely phenomenal .PERIOD the only downside is that it requires you to know how to text - send a text message .PERIOD nobody over <NUM> knows how to do that .PERIOD 
so i'm going to teach you something even better .PERIOD 
they put this teeny-weeny little ad ,COMMA about <NUM> characters long .PERIOD 
because there is one !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
as you can imagine ,COMMA it's college kids and old people .PERIOD 
when i call to leave you a message ,COMMA i get <NUM> seconds of instructions from a third-grade teacher on ambien !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
so now i'm going to tell you how to get out of that .PERIOD 
the reason i think that is that on the first day i tried one of these services ,COMMA i got two voicemail messages .PERIOD one was from a guy named michael stevenson ,COMMA which shouldn't be that hard to transcribe ,COMMA and it was misspelled .PERIOD 
i love my job .PERIOD 
i'm not kidding you .PERIOD the message said ,COMMA was walking along the street and sky was blue and emergency !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
and lastly ,COMMA i just have to talk about this one .PERIOD 
phone :COLON well ,COMMA that's good .PERIOD 
what are you doing ?QUESTIONMARK 
actually ,COMMA even so ,COMMA he was turned down by verizon and others .PERIOD 
it's got bad things and good things .PERIOD lets all acknowledge that right now .PERIOD 
it's absurd .PERIOD we have power outlets in every room of every building .PERIOD we have running water .PERIOD 
you type in what you want ,COMMA and it gives you the translation .PERIOD 
i know .PERIOD it's insane ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
it will immediately play you that song or that band .PERIOD 
if you like that one ,COMMA or don't like it ,COMMA you do thumbs-up and thumbs-down .PERIOD over time it tailors the songs so that it completely stops playing bad songs .PERIOD 
it proposes a restaurant .PERIOD 
and now the end is near .PERIOD 
i want an iphone .PERIOD 
who cares if it's at & amp ;SEMICOLON t ?QUESTIONMARK 
because the breast has become are very political organ .PERIOD 
i will do my best this morning to tell you what i think is the truth .PERIOD 
but first ,COMMA my disclosures .PERIOD 
she came to see me after discovering a breast lump .PERIOD 
you may recall a year ago when a firestorm erupted after the united states preventive services task force reviewed the world's mammography screening literature and issued a guideline recommending against screening mammograms in women in their <NUM> .PERIOD 
screening the average young woman with an mri is kind of like driving to the grocery store in a hummer .PERIOD 
but the problem was that the gamma detectors were these huge ,COMMA bulky tubes ,COMMA and they were filled with these scintillating crystals ,COMMA and you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast to find small tumors .PERIOD 
to say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement ,COMMA but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work that we chipped away with incremental modifications to this system .PERIOD 
the patient receives an injection of a radio tracer that's taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells ,COMMA but not by normal cells ,COMMA and this is the key difference from mammography .PERIOD 
our big break came in <NUM> .PERIOD 
after we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors ,COMMA we used these images to submit a grant to the susan g. komen foundation .PERIOD 
and we were elated when they took a chance on a team of completely unknown investigators and funded us to study <NUM> women with dense breasts ,COMMA comparing a screening mammogram to an mbi .PERIOD 
here's an example from that screening study .PERIOD 
it takes a radiologist years of specialty training to become expert in differentiating the normal anatomic detail from the worrisome finding .PERIOD 
but i suspect even the non-radiologists in the room can find the tumor on the mbi image .PERIOD 
after the fourth rejection ,COMMA we requested reconsideration of the manuscript ,COMMA because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a competing technology .PERIOD 
some women who develop breast cancer die from it many years later ,COMMA and most women ,COMMA thankfully ,COMMA survive .PERIOD 
so i worked with white noise .PERIOD 
and do not be disturbed any more by the other aggressive sound .PERIOD 
but it is just physiology .PERIOD it's just in your brain .PERIOD 
so in order to make this white noise a little bit active and reactive ,COMMA i create a ball ,COMMA a rolling ball able to analyze and find where does aggressive sound come from ,COMMA and roll ,COMMA at home or at work ,COMMA towards aggressive noise ,COMMA and emits white noise in order to neutralize it .PERIOD 
a loving dispute with your girl or boyfriend .PERIOD 
anyway ,COMMA in this same kind of approach ,COMMA i designed k .PERIOD 
i'm just a designer .PERIOD so i need them .PERIOD 
and the irony for me was of course ,COMMA i didn't do that for the sake of science progress .PERIOD 
i just do that to make money .PERIOD 
so we took too many of them .PERIOD 
this one is an antibiotic .PERIOD 
but in this case it is not the medication that is dependent on the patient .PERIOD 
so the idea is ,COMMA all night long the elastic skin of the third lung will slowly inflate itself ,COMMA including air and molecules ,COMMA for sure .PERIOD 
you have to know ,COMMA or you probably already know ,COMMA that indoor air pollution is more toxic than outdoor one .PERIOD 
so while i'm talking to you ,COMMA the seats you are sit on are currently emitting some invisible and odorless toxic gas .PERIOD sorry for that .PERIOD 
so your sofa ,COMMA your plastic chair ,COMMA your kid's toys give their own invisible reality .PERIOD and this one is very toxic .PERIOD 
this one is kind of the same approach because i include ,COMMA in a product like andrea ,COMMA some plants .PERIOD 
indeed ,COMMA this object is a domestic farm ,COMMA for fishes and green .PERIOD 
so the idea of this object is to be able to get at home very local food .PERIOD 
after ,COMMA it goes back into the fish tank .PERIOD 
now we can eat local food .PERIOD 
see ,COMMA like this one ?QUESTIONMARK 
you can see it there .PERIOD 
we're the new technologists .PERIOD 
i think about world war ii - some of our great technologists then ,COMMA some of our great physicists ,COMMA studying nuclear fission and fusion - just nuclear stuff .PERIOD 
we want the people building the technology thinking about what we should be doing with the technology .PERIOD 
so we can protect ourselves if he was up to no good ?QUESTIONMARK 
so to get people warmed up ,COMMA let's start with an easy question - something i'm sure everybody here has an opinion about :COLON iphone versus android .PERIOD 
but he was worried that all we seem to be doing is trading opinions about this .PERIOD 
in math ,COMMA we know the objective facts .PERIOD 
it's an objective truth about the form of two ,COMMA the abstract form .PERIOD 
then you would know what was really just and what wasn't .PERIOD 
if you think that way ,COMMA you have a platonist moral framework .PERIOD 
he thought it was impractical .PERIOD 
it's just a matter of the consequences .PERIOD 
kant was very good on this point ,COMMA and he said it a little better than i'll say it .PERIOD 
what should we be doing ?QUESTIONMARK what's the answer ?QUESTIONMARK 
there's not a formula .PERIOD 
and don't just find another technologist friend ;SEMICOLON find somebody different than you .PERIOD 
we care what happens in that opera .PERIOD 
in the early <NUM> ,COMMA some would say .PERIOD 
the gang had no way to make money .PERIOD 
so he was a math major in college who had a good heart ,COMMA and decided he wanted to get a sociology ph.d. came to the university of chicago .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA in his own words ,COMMA he looked like a freak .PERIOD 
so he showed up at the university of chicago .PERIOD 
there was a lot of gunfire ;SEMICOLON there were a lot of philosophical discussions he had with the gang members .PERIOD 
and you and i ,COMMA probably ,COMMA faced with the situation ,COMMA would think ,COMMA well ,COMMA i guess i'm going to write my dissertation on the grateful dead .PERIOD 
but the thing that really makes the gang seem like mcdonald's is its franchisees .PERIOD 
so what do the wages look like ?QUESTIONMARK so you might be surprised .PERIOD 
we found in our gang - and ,COMMA admittedly ,COMMA this was not really sort of a standard situation ;SEMICOLON this was a time of intense violence - of a lot of gang wars - as this gang actually became quite successful .PERIOD but there were costs .PERIOD 
that makes you pause - gives you some pause - those of you who believe that a death penalty's going to have an enormous deterrent effect on crime .PERIOD 
that the young people controlled the gang - that ,COMMA as you got older ,COMMA you dropped out of the gang .PERIOD 
so what happened was ,COMMA the people who happened to be in the right place at the right time - the people who happened to be leading the gang in the mid- to late <NUM> - became very ,COMMA very wealthy .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA he would say to his friends ,COMMA hey ,COMMA look at all the money i got in the gang .PERIOD 
often ,COMMA our theories fail quite miserably when we go to the data .PERIOD 
this is one of the basic ideas in labor economics ,COMMA called a compensating differential .PERIOD 
it's why we think garbage men might be paid more than people who work in parks ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
so in the words of one of the members of the gang i think makes this clear .PERIOD 
and the words of a gang member capture it quite nicely .PERIOD 
if you start taking losses ,COMMA they see you as weak and shit .PERIOD 
and i thought about it ,COMMA and i said ,COMMA ceos often pay themselves million-dollar bonuses ,COMMA even when companies are losing a lot of money .PERIOD 
also different aerobatic maneuvers are possible with a paraglider .PERIOD 
you can see the skydiver with the red suit ,COMMA he's in a stand-up position .PERIOD 
this is a jump i did in rio de janeiro .PERIOD 
<NUM> i did a base jump from the eiger ,COMMA from the monk and from the jungfrau ,COMMA three very famous mountains in switzerland .PERIOD 
june cohen :COLON i have some questions .PERIOD 
yet .PERIOD but people are trying .PERIOD are you among those - you're not going to commit - are you among those trying to do it ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's a dream .PERIOD it's a dream .PERIOD yeah .PERIOD 
and is that how you usually fly ?QUESTIONMARK 
do people come to you with projects and say ,COMMA we want you to do this !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
i don't necessarily think the film is so interesting .PERIOD 
the show was ,COMMA in a sense ,COMMA about that .PERIOD 
i also put a mirror in the ceiling ,COMMA and some fog ,COMMA some haze .PERIOD 
and what happens is that people ,COMMA they start to see themselves in this space .PERIOD 
what does it matter ?QUESTIONMARK 
it makes a difference whether you say ,COMMA i'm a part of this city .PERIOD 
it's quite simple and fundamental .PERIOD 
it doesn't really tell you what you're looking at .PERIOD 
or is that a three-hour hike ,COMMA or is that a whole day i'm looking at ?QUESTIONMARK 
if you have a waterfall in there ,COMMA right out there at the horizon ;SEMICOLON you look at the waterfall and you go ,COMMA oh ,COMMA the water is falling really slowly .PERIOD 
and experience is not just a kind of entertainment in a non-casual way .PERIOD 
so art ,COMMA in that sense ,COMMA i think holds an incredible relevance in the world in which we're moving into ,COMMA particularly right now .PERIOD 
what i really enjoyed about this project is reviving these people's words .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what we're going to do next is a poem that was written by nathalia crane .PERIOD 
the next poem is if no one ever marries me .PERIOD 
he went there after the death of his wife of smallpox and brought his two young children .PERIOD 
just bring it down a little .PERIOD 
thank you so much .PERIOD 
or this idea of the misunderstood genius ,COMMA frustrated that the world doesn't fit in with his or her ideas .PERIOD 
and quite often we sit in a design meeting and we discover that there is this great idea .PERIOD 
but for another client in another culture ,COMMA it could really be the right answer to a different question .PERIOD 
and they chose this mascot because the theme of the expo is better city ,COMMA better life .PERIOD 
but then we looked at recent urban development ,COMMA and we noticed that this is like a shanghai street ,COMMA <NUM> years ago .PERIOD all bikes ,COMMA no cars .PERIOD 
so if you come to the expo ,COMMA go straight to the danish pavilion ,COMMA get a danish bike ,COMMA and then continue on that to visit the other pavilions .PERIOD 
and in the middle of this sort of harbor bath ,COMMA we're actually going to put the actual little mermaid .PERIOD 
so the second story that i'd like to tell is ,COMMA actually starts in my own house .PERIOD 
and we discovered that by controlling the size of the holes ,COMMA we could actually turn the entire facade into a gigantic ,COMMA naturally ventilated ,COMMA rasterized image .PERIOD 
it has no water .PERIOD it has no energy ,COMMA no resources .PERIOD 
they accumulate the solar energy .PERIOD 
yes ,COMMA maybe just to round off .PERIOD 
i'm just going to list some of them .PERIOD 
where should we start on solving these problems ?QUESTIONMARK 
to climate change that would be like kyoto .PERIOD 
i'd love to go into ,COMMA and get you to think about this process ,COMMA and that's actually what we did .PERIOD 
of course ,COMMA you have to ask yourself ,COMMA why on earth was such a list never done before ?QUESTIONMARK 
nobody wants to do this .PERIOD 
we'd like to know these things .PERIOD 
three of the world's top experts saying ,COMMA what can we do ?QUESTIONMARK 
what would be the price ?QUESTIONMARK 
and of course ,COMMA i'm very happy you asked that question - - because that's a very good question .PERIOD 
this offends a lot of people ,COMMA and that's probably one of the things where people will say i shouldn't come back ,COMMA either .PERIOD 
and i'd like to talk about that ,COMMA because that's really curious .PERIOD 
the reason why they came up with saying that kyoto - or doing something more than kyoto - is a bad deal is simply because it's very inefficient .PERIOD 
it's not to say that if we had all the money in the world ,COMMA we wouldn't want to do it .PERIOD 
there are many problems out there in the world .PERIOD 
and what i want to make sure of is ,COMMA if we actually focus on problems ,COMMA that we focus on the right ones .PERIOD 
the ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA we'll be even richer than that .PERIOD 
we have ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the day after tomorrow - it looks great ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's not about making things that have the most media attention ,COMMA but it's about making places where we can actually do the most good .PERIOD 
but the point ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is still to say ,COMMA if you get another <NUM> billion dollars ,COMMA we still want to spend that in the best possible way ,COMMA don't we ?QUESTIONMARK 
so we actually invited <NUM> young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem .PERIOD 
my studio in bali was only <NUM> minutes away from a monkey forest ,COMMA and monkeys ,COMMA of course ,COMMA are supposed to be the happiest of all animals .PERIOD 
the serif is not really in place .PERIOD 
and the rider thinks that he can tell the elephant what to do ,COMMA but the elephant really has his own ideas .PERIOD 
and from that point of view we turned it into a lovely project .PERIOD 
we stir this in until it's completely dissolved and then pour it into a growth bath .PERIOD 
and then we're ready to add the living organism .PERIOD 
and actually ,COMMA in hot weather ,COMMA i can just grow it outside .PERIOD 
but i do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition to our increasingly precious natural resources .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
suzanne lee .PERIOD 
i made contact with a child from swat who studied in a madrassa like this .PERIOD 
how do the taliban in your area get people to join them ?QUESTIONMARK 
then they take us to a madrassa and teach us things from the koran .PERIOD 
they ask us to use them only against the infidels .PERIOD 
soc :COLON i ,COMMA in my research ,COMMA have seen that the taliban have perfected the way in which they recruit and train children ,COMMA and i think it's a five-step process .PERIOD 
these children are explicitly forbidden from reading newspapers ,COMMA listening to radio ,COMMA reading any books that the teachers do not prescribe them .PERIOD 
effectively ,COMMA the taliban create a complete blackout of any other source of information for these children .PERIOD 
he blew himself up ,COMMA killing six .PERIOD 
two years ago here at ted i reported that we had discovered at saturn ,COMMA with the cassini spacecraft ,COMMA an anomalously warm and geologically active region at the southern tip of the small saturnine moon enceladus ,COMMA seen here .PERIOD 
while they're not amino acids ,COMMA we're now finding things like propane and benzene ,COMMA hydrogen cyanide ,COMMA and formaldehyde .PERIOD 
so we are very encouraged by these results .PERIOD 
and this is quite an extraordinary idea ,COMMA but it is reality today .PERIOD 
this was created by an architectural firm called shiro .PERIOD 
and you can actually walk into it .PERIOD 
now <NUM> printing can break away barriers in design which challenge the constraints of mass production .PERIOD 
there's a lower chance of rejection .PERIOD 
the piece of software will keep an individual within the bounds of the possible .PERIOD 
i don't think that will happen soon .PERIOD 
we're now ,COMMA instead of shipping a product across the world ,COMMA we're sending data across the internet .PERIOD 
and applying this to the idea of building up what's in our bodies .PERIOD 
so one of the pioneers ,COMMA for example ,COMMA is dr. anthony atala ,COMMA and he has been working on layering cells to create body parts - bladders ,COMMA valves ,COMMA kidneys .PERIOD 
we like different things .PERIOD 
i've been working on issues of poverty for more than <NUM> years ,COMMA and so it's ironic that the problem that and question that i most grapple with is how you actually define poverty .PERIOD what does it mean ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i would see kids on the street corners ,COMMA and they'd say obama ,COMMA he's our brother !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
and she said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the poverty wasn't so bad .PERIOD it was the humiliation and the embarrassment of it all .PERIOD 
and i say ,COMMA'look at me .PERIOD you are not dead .PERIOD 
and in the middle of this economic crisis ,COMMA where so many of us are inclined to pull in with fear ,COMMA i think we're well suited to take a cue from jane and reach out ,COMMA recognizing that being poor doesn't mean being ordinary .PERIOD 
it was a really big excitement for me to get into caltech .PERIOD 
and i concluded ,COMMA after researching every other technology that we could deploy for storing energy - flywheels ,COMMA different formulations of batteries - it just wasn't practical to store energy .PERIOD 
there are a lot of new things that are happening to do that ,COMMA but fundamentally the process requires a tremendous amount of energy .PERIOD 
so i tried to figure out what other way could we try and make cost-effective solar electricity .PERIOD 
traditionally ,COMMA concentrators look like this .PERIOD 
your efficiency goes down with more bounces ,COMMA because you lose about <NUM> percent with each bounce ,COMMA but this allowed us to collect light from a plus or minus <NUM> degree angle .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA once you have mobility ,COMMA now you're making a lot of engines because you've got lots of units ,COMMA as opposed to steam ships or big factories where you're not making as many units ,COMMA so this was the engine that ended up benefiting from mass production where all the other engines didn't benefit .PERIOD 
so we tried to look at the stirling engine in a new way ,COMMA because it was practical - weight no longer mattered for our application the internal combustion engine took off because weight mattered because you were moving around .PERIOD 
so someone came up with a very clever idea ,COMMA to - instead of heating the whole cylinder and cooling the whole cylinder ,COMMA what about if you put a displacer inside - a little thing that shuttles the air back and forth .PERIOD 
we measured each one ,COMMA we readjusted the model to what we measured ,COMMA and then we led that to the current prototype .PERIOD 
it led to a very compact ,COMMA inexpensive engine ,COMMA and this is what the engine looks like .PERIOD 
so an example of that is ,COMMA here's the map of the united states .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA look at africa .PERIOD 
there's <NUM> watts of light pouring on the stage ,COMMA one horsepower is <NUM> watts ,COMMA at full power .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA everywhere around us we have insatiable use for energy because it's so cheap .PERIOD 
and it's cheap because we've been subsidized by energy that's been concentrated by the sun .PERIOD 
headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change ,COMMA and headlines that look like this when they have to do with air quality or smog .PERIOD 
and this is the tower from below .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA as you can imagine ,COMMA the inside of this aircraft doesn't look like any plane you would take on vacation .PERIOD 
we do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule .PERIOD 
what i am always thinking about is what this session is about ,COMMA which is called simplicity .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i was fortunate enough to be born a very dreamy child .PERIOD 
and that was a good thing to help ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the cause .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA then he came back ,COMMA and things happened ,COMMA and i decided i really hated my writing ,COMMA that it was awful ,COMMA awful ,COMMA purple prose .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA tibor really started the studio ,COMMA called m & amp ;SEMICOLON co .PERIOD 
that to be able to talk about content ,COMMA to break apart what you normally expect ,COMMA to use humor and surprise ,COMMA elegance and humanity in your work was really important to us .PERIOD 
i don't really - i mean ,COMMA i could tell you that i didn't understand ,COMMA i'm not proud of it ,COMMA but i didn't understand let's say <NUM> percent of the talks at this conference .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i'm open to the possibilities of not knowing and finding out something new .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA i was able to put that into this story ,COMMA which is an alphabet ,COMMA and hopefully go on to something else .PERIOD 
we hoped we'd be funny ,COMMA but we didn't know it would be a cover ,COMMA and we didn't know that that image ,COMMA at the moment that it happened ,COMMA would be something that would be so wonderful for a lot of people .PERIOD 
and david remnick ,COMMA who was really wonderful about it ,COMMA had one problem .PERIOD he didn't like al zheimers ,COMMA because he thought it would insult people with alzheimer's .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA he noticed a large stain in the center of the rug .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what i did when i was painting was i started singing ,COMMA because i really adore singing ,COMMA and i think that music is the highest form of all art .PERIOD 
i happen to know it for a fact .PERIOD 
maybe amongst themselves they had a few good laughs ,COMMA but stalin was a paranoid man ,COMMA even more than my father .PERIOD 
which i think i made up ,COMMA which is a good thing .PERIOD 
i received a box in the mail and it was wrapped with newspaper and there was the picture of the man on the newspaper and he was dead .PERIOD 
and i really spend a lot of time wondering ,COMMA how much truth do we tell ?QUESTIONMARK 
how do we know when we are ourselves ?QUESTIONMARK 
a quote by bertrand russell ,COMMA all the labor of all the ages ,COMMA all the devotion ,COMMA all the inspiration ,COMMA all the noonday brightness of human genius are destined to extinction .PERIOD 
and i would like to run it for them .PERIOD 
and it says ,COMMA ich habe genug ,COMMA which is a bach cantata ,COMMA which i once thought meant i've had it ,COMMA i can't take it anymore ,COMMA give me a break ,COMMA but i was wrong .PERIOD 
i thought that things would be pretty fun and there would be more things to play with .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA since we've been here this week ,COMMA we've taken millions of breaths ,COMMA collectively ,COMMA and perhaps we haven't witnessed any course changes happening in our lives ,COMMA but we often miss the very subtle changes .PERIOD 
so we threw in - we created a primordial soup with lots of pieces of robots - with bars ,COMMA with motors ,COMMA with neurons .PERIOD 
we're concerned in the national security community ,COMMA and of course in the biology community and the public health community .PERIOD 
it's also carried on migration patterns of wild migratory aquatic birds .PERIOD 
so what have people been doing with this money ?QUESTIONMARK 
let's everybody run around and play your role .PERIOD 
most local facilities would all be competing to try and get their hands on their piece of the federal stockpile of a drug called tamiflu ,COMMA which may or may not be helpful - i'll get into that - of available vaccines ,COMMA and any other treatments ,COMMA and masks ,COMMA and anything that's been stockpiled .PERIOD 
and you'll have massive competition .PERIOD 
during the sars epidemic in beijing quarantine did seem to help .PERIOD 
and their hand got contaminated with the outside of the mask ,COMMA and then they rubbed their nose .PERIOD bingo !EXCLAMATIONMARK they got sars .PERIOD 
the pandemic circulated three times in <NUM> months in the absence of commercial air travel .PERIOD 
this was based on european and north american data .PERIOD 
and that a more likely toll is somewhere in the neighborhood of <NUM> to <NUM> million people before we had commercial air travel .PERIOD 
so are we ready ?QUESTIONMARK 
if you expand that out to think of a whole community ,COMMA or all your employees in your company ,COMMA you begin to realize how limited the tamiflu option might be .PERIOD 
but really ?QUESTIONMARK do you really have a place to stockpile <NUM> months worth of food ?QUESTIONMARK twenty-four months worth of food ?QUESTIONMARK 
do you want to view the pandemic threat the way back in the <NUM> people viewed the civil defense issue ,COMMA and build your own little bomb shelter for pandemic flu ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i hope i've convinced you of that ,COMMA which means that the real job is go out and say to your local leaders ,COMMA and your national leaders ,COMMA why haven't you solved these problems ?QUESTIONMARK 
but can you sustain your company that way ?QUESTIONMARK 
the moment that you see any evidence of serious human-to-human to transmission .PERIOD 
the mechanism isn't clear .PERIOD 
again we don't really know for sure .PERIOD 
audience member :COLON one of the things i've heard is that the real death cause when you get a flu is the associated pneumonia ,COMMA and that a pneumonia vaccine may offer you <NUM> percent better chance of survival .PERIOD 
and so far in the <NUM> cases in people ,COMMA similarly bacterial infection has not been an issue at all .PERIOD 
and it won't do any good to bring in the tanks and the artillery because those t-cells don't recognize it either .PERIOD 
now my story has a lot to do with dreaming ,COMMA although i'm known to make my dreams come true .PERIOD 
one ,COMMA two ,COMMA three ,COMMA four ,COMMA five ,COMMA six and seven .PERIOD 
and i go to see a famous magician and proudly ask him ,COMMA well what do you think ?QUESTIONMARK 
for the move to be professional ,COMMA it has to be less than one second and it has to be perfect .PERIOD 
but in america you have to explain .PERIOD what are clubs ?QUESTIONMARK 
they have to be precisely lathed .PERIOD 
anyway ,COMMA here i was progressing with my new clubs .PERIOD 
the clubs were escaping me at each throw .PERIOD 
so i proudly showed him my clubs .PERIOD 
he said ,COMMA philippe ,COMMA you have been had .PERIOD 
they are impossible to juggle .PERIOD 
i get a pair of pliers and some coat hangers ,COMMA and i gather them together in some kind of ropey path .PERIOD 
well within a few days i'm able to do one crossing .PERIOD 
if not ,COMMA i will never do that first step .PERIOD 
it's a straight line ,COMMA which sags ,COMMA which sways ,COMMA which vibrates ,COMMA which rolls on itself ,COMMA which is ice ,COMMA which is three tons tight ,COMMA ready to explode ,COMMA ready to swallow me .PERIOD 
an inner howl assails me ,COMMA the wild longing to flee .PERIOD 
i was not interested in collecting the gigantic ,COMMA in breaking records .PERIOD 
and something happened .PERIOD 
he didn't know the true story .PERIOD 
trees are wonderful arenas for discovery because of their tall stature ,COMMA their complex structure ,COMMA the biodiversity they foster and their quiet beauty .PERIOD 
the most mysterious part of forests is the upper tree canopy .PERIOD 
these are not epiphyte roots :COLON these are roots that emerge from the trunk and branch of the host trees themselves .PERIOD 
we know it's a lot ,COMMA but we do not yet know the answers to how much ,COMMA and by what processes ,COMMA carbon is being taken out of the atmosphere ,COMMA held in its biomass ,COMMA and moving on through the ecosystem .PERIOD 
they ended up making a cd which they took home to their family and friends ,COMMA thereby expressing their own experiences with nature in their own medium .PERIOD 
they were incredibly enthusiastic about the work .PERIOD 
and they embraced the idea that they could help develop a research design in order to grow these mosses .PERIOD 
we gave talks once a month ,COMMA and that actually ended up implementing some amazing sustainability projects at the prisons - organic gardens ,COMMA worm culture ,COMMA recycling ,COMMA water catchment and beekeeping .PERIOD 
as many of you are aware ,COMMA the world of academia is a rather inward-looking one .PERIOD 
i'm trying to help researchers move more outward to have their own partnerships with people outside of the academic community .PERIOD 
when i look into my heart ,COMMA i see trees - this is actually an image of a real heart - there are trees in our hearts ,COMMA there are trees in your hearts .PERIOD 
it was taken <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
there is a problem with scuba though ,COMMA in that it imposes some limitations on how deep you can go ,COMMA and it turns out that depth is about <NUM> feet .PERIOD 
and there's a phenomenon called henry's law that says that gases will dissolve into a fluid in proportion to the partial pressures which you're exposing them to .PERIOD 
you die also because oxygen toxicity can cause a seizure - makes you convulse underwater ,COMMA not a good thing to happen underwater .PERIOD 
this picture was taken <NUM> feet deep ,COMMA catching new species of fish .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA indeed ,COMMA there is a better way .PERIOD 
alright ,COMMA closed-circuit rebreather - what is it about it that makes it different from scuba ,COMMA and why is it better ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA there are three main advantages to a rebreather .PERIOD 
so we need another gas ,COMMA something to dilute the oxygen with .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA if we want to go deeper ,COMMA of course ,COMMA we need another gas supply .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA normally you don't have to do that because all of it's done automatically for you with the electronics ,COMMA the third system of a rebreather .PERIOD 
and yes ,COMMA it's a little nerve-wracking .PERIOD 
so sharks aren't quite as dangerous as most people make them out to be .PERIOD 
there's a cover story all about the great explorers of our time .PERIOD 
the last article is an article entitled no new frontiers .PERIOD 
even if you ignore the scientific value of this thing ,COMMA just look at the monetary value of this thing .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA eventually ,COMMA i got around to looking in my bucket .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA this one's pretty cool .PERIOD 
so a very large percentage of what is out there isn't really known .PERIOD 
we thought we had a handle on all the reef fish diversity - evidently not .PERIOD 
at the beginning i told you that i was going to show you two extraordinary photographs .PERIOD 
the reason i show this - not to put a downer on everything - but i just want to use it to key off my philosophy of life in general ,COMMA which is that we all have two goals .PERIOD 
the first goal we share with every other living thing on this planet ,COMMA which is to survive .PERIOD i call it perpetuation :COLON the survival of the species and survival of ourselves ,COMMA because they're both about perpetuating the genome .PERIOD 
you have to balance those two goals .PERIOD 
but here's what really perplexed me .PERIOD 
but diagnosing a brain disorder without actually looking at the brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem based on their physical symptoms ,COMMA without even doing an ecg or a chest x-ray to look at the heart .PERIOD 
yet ,COMMA despite all the advances in medical technology ,COMMA the diagnosis of brain disorders in one in six children still remained so limited .PERIOD 
and then i came across a team at harvard university that had taken one such advanced medical technology and finally applied it ,COMMA instead of in brain research ,COMMA towards diagnosing brain disorders in children .PERIOD 
and another program called statistical probability mapping then performs mathematical calculations to determine whether any of these abnormalities are clinically significant ,COMMA allowing us to provide a much more accurate neurological diagnosis of the child's symptoms .PERIOD 
when we used this groundbreaking eeg technology to actually look at justin's brain ,COMMA the results were startling .PERIOD 
but we are now in a new era of neuroscience ,COMMA one in which we can finally look directly at brain function in real time with no risks and no side effects ,COMMA non-invasively ,COMMA and find the true source of so many disabilities in children .PERIOD 
it's something like life ,COMMA that once you get in it you can't get out .PERIOD 
there are two clips i want to show you ,COMMA the first one is a kind of hodgepodge ,COMMA its just three little moments ,COMMA four little moments with three of the people who are here tonight .PERIOD 
it was built entirely by hand off bamboo scaffolding ,COMMA people carrying these baskets of concrete on their heads ,COMMA dumping them in the forms .PERIOD

that line would have to be <NUM> million miles above this stage .PERIOD 
i think this is what david deutsch meant in <NUM> ,COMMA when he ended his oxford tedtalk by saying he had two principles he'd like to share for living ,COMMA and he would like to carve them on stone tablets .PERIOD 
we've been searching ever since ,COMMA but it's impossible to overstate the magnitude of the search that remains .PERIOD 
and over those long distances ,COMMA its signal is very faint when it reaches us .PERIOD 
but this is a simple signal ,COMMA and tomorrow we want to be able to find more complex signals .PERIOD 
this is a very good year .PERIOD

the first step would be to tap into the global brain trust ,COMMA to build an environment where raw data could be stored ,COMMA and where it could be accessed and manipulated ,COMMA where new algorithms could be developed and old algorithms made more efficient .PERIOD 
i'm sorry seth godin ,COMMA but over the millennia ,COMMA we've seen where tribalism leads .PERIOD 
it records the annual rise and fall of greenhouse gases and temperatures going back before the onset of the last ice ages .PERIOD 
ten times a day ,COMMA they extract the 10-foot long cylinder of compressed ice crystals that contain the unsullied air and trace chemicals laid down by snow ,COMMA season after season for thousands of years .PERIOD 
from this ,COMMA we can detect an extraordinary number of things .PERIOD 
imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics .PERIOD 
they have to ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA make sure this ice never gets warmer than about <NUM> degrees below zero ,COMMA otherwise ,COMMA the key gases inside it will dissipate .PERIOD 
early explorers sailed off the edge of the map ,COMMA and they found a place where the normal rules of time and temperature seem suspended .PERIOD 
it is a voice of experience .PERIOD 
it is a voice we should heed .PERIOD 
this thesis is set out in a book called winning the oil endgame that four colleagues and i wrote and have posted for free at oilendgame.com - about <NUM> downloads so far .PERIOD 
so when we did ,COMMA we found some very surprising things .PERIOD

the question is ,COMMA who will make them ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's financeable in the private capital market .PERIOD

in the airplane business ,COMMA it's again a similar story where the first <NUM> percent fuel saving is free ,COMMA as boeing is now demonstrating in its new dreamliner .PERIOD 
and it turns out that these are quite remarkable for safety .PERIOD 
the golf was totaled .PERIOD 
because these materials could actually absorb six to <NUM> times as much energy per pound as steel ,COMMA and do so a lot more smoothly .PERIOD 
this expands choice rapidly in the market ,COMMA and actually makes more money for automakers as well .PERIOD 
i'd like to deal with the lack of affordable personal mobility in this country by making it very cheaply possible for low-income families to get efficient ,COMMA reliable ,COMMA warranted new cars that they could otherwise never get .PERIOD 
this creates a new million-car-a-year market for detroit from customers they weren't going to get otherwise ,COMMA because they weren't creditworthy and could never afford a new car .PERIOD 
it turns out that if ,COMMA say ,COMMA african-american and white households had the same car ownership ,COMMA it would cut employment disparity about in half by providing better access to job opportunities .PERIOD 
just turn it over to the private sector ,COMMA and we have an internet .PERIOD 
ours is on the demand side .PERIOD 
i was just coming out of a failed virtual reality business and supporting myself by being on the speaking circuit and writing books - after twenty years or so in the computer game industry having ideas that people didn't think they could sell .PERIOD 
and at the end of those remarkable conversations with kids and their best friends across the united states ,COMMA after two years ,COMMA we pulled together some survey data from another <NUM> children ,COMMA drew up a set up of what we thought were the key findings of our research ,COMMA and spent another year transforming them into design heuristics ,COMMA for designing computer-based products - and ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA any kind of products - for little girls ,COMMA ages eight to <NUM> .PERIOD

he went through europe ,COMMA through world war ii ,COMMA stealing ,COMMA extorting and occasionally buying various paintings for his collection .PERIOD 
so he finally found an art dealer ,COMMA a dutch art dealer named han van meegeren ,COMMA who sold him a wonderful vermeer for the cost of what would now be <NUM> million dollars .PERIOD 
he had a lesser charge of forgery ,COMMA got a year sentence and died a hero to the dutch people .PERIOD 
many sociologists like veblen and wolfe would argue that the reason why we take origins so seriously is because we're snobs ,COMMA because we're focused on status .PERIOD

it's very simple :COLON pour it from an expensive bottle .PERIOD 
it will make a difference if they turn out to be much younger or much older than you think they are .PERIOD

who here likes the work of jackson pollock ?QUESTIONMARK 
and the washington post reporter gene weingarten decided to enlist him for an audacious experiment .PERIOD

he actually made <NUM> dollars more than that ,COMMA but he didn't count it .PERIOD 
so she's stunned that he's standing in a subway station .PERIOD 
one lovely experiment was done by kurt gray and dan wegner .PERIOD 
and what i hope to show is that unpicking dodgy claims ,COMMA unpicking the evidence behind dodgy claims ,COMMA isn't a kind of nasty carping activity ;SEMICOLON it's socially useful ,COMMA but it's also an extremely valuable explanatory tool .PERIOD 
she ,COMMA it turns out ,COMMA has a non-accredited correspondence course ph.d .PERIOD 
a glass of red wine a day could help prevent breast cancer .PERIOD 
so i'm going to tell you about one trial ,COMMA which is probably the most well-reported trial in the u.k. news media over the past decade .PERIOD 
and this has been demonstrated in a whole raft of fascinating studies comparing one kind of placebo against another .PERIOD 
we know from three different studies on three different types of pain that a saltwater injection is a more effective treatment for pain than taking a sugar pill ,COMMA taking a dummy pill that has no medicine in it - not because the injection or the pills do anything physically to the body ,COMMA but because an injection feels like a much more dramatic intervention .PERIOD 
but that's not enough .PERIOD 
what i find really fascinating is that the pharmaceutical industry uses exactly the same kinds of tricks and devices ,COMMA but slightly more sophisticated versions of them ,COMMA in order to distort the evidence that they give to doctors and patients ,COMMA and which we use to make vitally important decisions .PERIOD 
and it's a foregone conclusion ,COMMA if you give a drug at that high a dose ,COMMA that it will have more side effects and that your new drug will look better .PERIOD 
everybody wanted to show that their drug was better than risperidone ,COMMA so you see a bunch of trials comparing new antipsychotic drugs against risperidone at eight milligrams a day .PERIOD 
this is a drug called reboxetine .PERIOD 
around half of all of the trial data on antidepressants has been withheld ,COMMA but it goes way beyond that .PERIOD 
but the companies withheld that data from them ,COMMA and so did the european medicines agency for three years .PERIOD 
the infectious diseases cochrane group ,COMMA which are based in italy ,COMMA has been trying to get the full data in a usable form out of the drug companies so that they can make a full decision about whether this drug is effective or not ,COMMA and they've not been able to get that information .PERIOD 
this is undoubtedly the single biggest ethical problem facing medicine today .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
i saw people struggling to get by ,COMMA not knowing what was what and what was next .PERIOD 
you want a better life for yourself .PERIOD 
there's this thing ,COMMA this militarization of the world ,COMMA and it's centered right in the united states .PERIOD

they do wonderful things ,COMMA but they also do the bad things ,COMMA and you can't tell the difference .PERIOD

even at that rate ,COMMA by <NUM> average gdp per capita in the world will be $ <NUM> .PERIOD 
that's not that far .PERIOD 
but some of our grandchildren probably will .PERIOD 
what about a great depression ?QUESTIONMARK 
now let's imagine that you were an economist in <NUM> ,COMMA trying to forecast future growth for the united states ,COMMA not knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff ,COMMA not knowing that we were about to enter the greatest economic disaster certainly in the <NUM> century .PERIOD 
in the last <NUM> years ,COMMA thanks to explorations in remote parts of the world and advances in technology ,COMMA biologists have ,COMMA for example ,COMMA added a full one-third of the known frog and other amphibian species ,COMMA to bring the current total to <NUM> ,COMMA and more continue to pour in .PERIOD 
two new kinds of whales have been discovered ,COMMA along with two new antelopes ,COMMA dozens of monkey species and a new kind of elephant - and even a distinct kind of gorilla .PERIOD 
consider the nematode roundworm ,COMMA the most abundant of all animals .PERIOD 
but that number of bacteria species can be found in one gram of soil ,COMMA just a little handful of soil ,COMMA in the <NUM> billion bacteria that would be there .PERIOD 
my own epiphany as a conservationist came in <NUM> ,COMMA while a harvard graduate student ,COMMA searching for rare ants found in the mountain forests of cuba ,COMMA ants that shine in the sunlight - metallic green or metallic blue ,COMMA according to species ,COMMA and one species ,COMMA i discovered ,COMMA metallic gold .PERIOD 
and the final letter is o ,COMMA for over-harvesting - driving species into extinction by excessive hunting and fishing .PERIOD 
that's in the united states .PERIOD 
but what excites me is that since i first put forward this particular idea in that form ,COMMA science has advanced .PERIOD 
i wish you would help them .PERIOD 
the encyclopedia will quickly pay for itself in practical applications .PERIOD 
the idea that in that room at that moment ,COMMA everyone ,COMMA regardless of their age ,COMMA their gender ,COMMA their race ,COMMA their color ,COMMA their religion ,COMMA comes together .PERIOD 
let's start with technology .PERIOD 
all right .PERIOD let's start with theater .PERIOD 
but the teachers came to me afterward and told me they hadn't seen the kids that attentive .PERIOD 
zero does not speak ,COMMA is neither man nor woman .PERIOD 
and that usually ,COMMA if you're a bit extraordinary ,COMMA if you're not exactly of human appearance ,COMMA then people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud .PERIOD 
i've worked as a doctor clown in a hospital for two years .PERIOD 
it's a human and technological revolution .PERIOD 
and well ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the dutch can't eat all these pigs .PERIOD 
and what i was curious about - because historically ,COMMA the whole pig would be used up until the last bit so nothing would be wasted - and i was curious to find out if this was actually still the case .PERIOD 
and in cheesecake and all kinds of desserts ,COMMA like chocolate mousse ,COMMA tiramisu ,COMMA vanilla pudding ,COMMA everything that's cooled in the supermarket ,COMMA there's gelatin to make it look good .PERIOD 
fine bone china - this is a real classic .PERIOD 
i was not planning on showing you any meat because ,COMMA of course ,COMMA half the book's meat and you probably all know what meats they are .PERIOD 
and the reason for this is that pigs are actually quite close to human beings ,COMMA so the collagen is as well .PERIOD 
and they said ,COMMA well the director of the company decided not to let you borrow this heart valve ,COMMA because want his product to be associated with pigs .PERIOD 
well it is ,COMMA because everything that can't be used for anything else is made into a fuel that can be used as renewable energy source .PERIOD 
this is a picture of maurice druon ,COMMA the honorary perpetual secretary of l'academie francaise ,COMMA the french academy .PERIOD 
we see it in the constant appearance of slang and jargon ,COMMA of the historical change in languages ,COMMA in divergence of dialects and the formation of new languages .PERIOD 
the problem is ,COMMA which verbs go in which constructions ?QUESTIONMARK 
a transitive verb mandates that there has to be an object there :COLON sam devoured the pizza .PERIOD you can't just say ,COMMA sam devoured .PERIOD 
there are dozens or scores of verbs of this type ,COMMA each of which shapes its sentence .PERIOD 
first ,COMMA there's a level of fine-grained conceptual structure ,COMMA which we automatically and unconsciously compute every time we produce or utter a sentence ,COMMA that governs our use of language .PERIOD 
or ,COMMA the meeting went from three to four ,COMMA in which we conceive of time as stretched along a line .PERIOD 
or ,COMMA rose forced herself to go ,COMMA as if there were two entities inside rose's head ,COMMA engaged in a tug of a war .PERIOD 
and i'll start out with a puzzle ,COMMA the puzzle of indirect speech acts .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA in brotherhoods ,COMMA fraternal organizations ,COMMA sororities ,COMMA locutions like the family of man ,COMMA you try to get people who are not related to use the relationship type that would ordinarily be appropriate to close kin .PERIOD 
in that case ,COMMA the consequences are rather severe .PERIOD 
on the other hand ,COMMA if you extend the bribe ,COMMA if the officer is dishonest ,COMMA you get a huge payoff of going free .PERIOD 
the honest officer can't hold you to it as being a bribe ,COMMA and therefore ,COMMA you get the nuisance of the traffic ticket .PERIOD 
because i get to talk about one of my favorite critters ,COMMA which is the western grebe .PERIOD you haven't lived until you've seen these guys do their courtship dance .PERIOD 
what they said to us at first was ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we already do biomimicry .PERIOD 
and they said ,COMMA you know what happens is ,COMMA mineral - just like at your house - mineral builds up .PERIOD 
so if we had some way to stop this scaling - and so i picked up some shells on the beach .PERIOD and i asked them ,COMMA what is scaling ?QUESTIONMARK what's inside your pipes ?QUESTIONMARK 
and they didn't know that .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA it's a silo ,COMMA people in silos .PERIOD they didn't know that the same thing was happening .PERIOD so one of them thought about it and said ,COMMA ok ,COMMA well ,COMMA if this is just crystallization that happens automatically out of seawater - self-assembly - then why aren't shells infinite in size ?QUESTIONMARK what stops the scaling ?QUESTIONMARK 
how do we redesign the world that we make ,COMMA the human-made world ?QUESTIONMARK 
and there's a lot of cool technologies out there that life has .PERIOD 
what's the syllabus ?QUESTIONMARK 
and thirdly ,COMMA how does life make things disappear into systems ?QUESTIONMARK 
and at the same time ,COMMA i'm listening to a lot of businesses and finding what their sort of grand challenges are .PERIOD 
on the lower left there is a picture of mother of pearl forming out of seawater .PERIOD it's a layered structure that's mineral and then polymer ,COMMA and it makes it very ,COMMA very tough .PERIOD 
here are two organisms that pull water .PERIOD 
pulling water out of monterey fog and out of the sweaty air in atlanta ,COMMA before it gets into a building ,COMMA are key technologies .PERIOD 
green chemistry is replacing our industrial chemistry with nature's recipe book .PERIOD 
that little guy over there is a tardigrade .PERIOD 
there is a problem with vaccines around the world not getting to patients .PERIOD and the reason is that the refrigeration somehow gets broken ;SEMICOLON what's called the cold chain gets broken .PERIOD 
they can be put in a glove compartment ,COMMA ok .PERIOD 
chris anderson :COLON talk about foreplay ,COMMA i - we need to get to <NUM> ,COMMA but really quickly .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA so that's the healing one .PERIOD 
and really ,COMMA that's what other organisms do as well .PERIOD 
that's the twelfth one .PERIOD 
and i saw from a young age that having a decent job and earning a good living made the biggest difference for families who were struggling .PERIOD 
i mean here was a girl who had never lived in peace time who somehow had come to sound like a candidate from the apprentice .PERIOD 
my first business was a dressmaking business i started under the taliban .PERIOD 
the imf official is hardly the only person to automatically file women under micro .PERIOD 
and in many places ,COMMA they're there .PERIOD 
because - and i say this as somebody who worked in finance - <NUM> billion dollars at least has gone into the emerging markets in the past decade .PERIOD 
just think of the benefits when it comes to jobs ,COMMA productivity ,COMMA employment ,COMMA child nutrition ,COMMA maternal mortality ,COMMA literacy and much ,COMMA much more .PERIOD 
and not one country in all the world has eliminated its economic participation gap - not one .PERIOD 
the women in my family are not exceptions .PERIOD 
the women in this room and watching in l.a .PERIOD 
together we can make certain that the so-called exceptions begin to rule .PERIOD 
once upon a time in <NUM> century germany ,COMMA there was the book .PERIOD 
now during this time ,COMMA the book was the king of storytelling .PERIOD 
his name was lothar ,COMMA lothar meggendorfer .PERIOD 
this man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold .PERIOD 
whether storytellers realized it or not ,COMMA they were channeling meggendorfer's spirit when they moved opera to vaudville ,COMMA radio news to radio theater ,COMMA film to film in motion to film in sound ,COMMA color ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA on vhs and on dvd .PERIOD 
and i really want to build green ,COMMA but i'm very suspicious of all of these well-meaning articles ,COMMA people long on moral authority and short on data ,COMMA telling me how to do these kinds of things .PERIOD 
wipe it up ,COMMA throw it away .PERIOD 
unless i use a front-loading ,COMMA high-efficiency washing machine ,COMMA and then it looks a little bit better .PERIOD 
so what this says is that sometimes the things that you least expect - the position in which you put the handle - have a bigger effect than any of those other things that you were trying to optimize .PERIOD 
we wanted to know how much better we could do .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA pvc is a little bit better ,COMMA but still not as good as the wood that we chose .PERIOD 
when it comes time to sheetrock ,COMMA if you use ecorock it's about a quarter of the embodied energy of standard sheetrock .PERIOD 
if you put carpeting in your house ,COMMA it's about a tenth of the embodied energy of the entire house ,COMMA unless you use concrete or wood for a much lower embodied energy .PERIOD 
so now we add in the final construction energy ,COMMA we add it all up ,COMMA and we've built a house for less than half of the typical embodied energy for building a house like this .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i probably would have upgraded the old house to be more energy-efficient ,COMMA and in that case ,COMMA it would take me more about <NUM> years to break even .PERIOD 
so what does this mean ?QUESTIONMARK 
you might want to leave now .PERIOD 
so i did .PERIOD 
and i'm talking specifically about synanthropic species ,COMMA which are species that have adapted specifically for human ecologies ,COMMA species like rats and cockroaches and crows .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA for example ,COMMA rats are incredibly responsive breeders .PERIOD 
we're seeing a population boom with crows .PERIOD 
and i'll give you an example of that .PERIOD 
and these crows use sticks in the wild to get insects and whatnot out of pieces of wood .PERIOD 
they messed up and left just a stick of wire in there .PERIOD 
so what's significant about this isn't that crows are using cars to crack nuts .PERIOD 
and as we heard yesterday ,COMMA that's the pandora's box that's getting human beings in trouble ,COMMA and we're starting to see it with them .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA they're used to the sound of the machine ,COMMA and they keep coming back ,COMMA and digging out these peanuts from amongst the pile of coins that's there .PERIOD 
the main thing ,COMMA the main point of all this for me is that we can find mutually beneficial systems for these species .PERIOD 
so my grandfather told me when i was a little girl ,COMMA if you say a word often enough ,COMMA it becomes you .PERIOD 
anybody out here old enough to know studs terkel ,COMMA that old radio man ?QUESTIONMARK 
the gradual slippage -'slippage' is the word used by the people in watergate ,COMMA moral slippage - it's a gradual kind of thing ,COMMA combination of things .PERIOD 
oh ,COMMA let me kind of tell you a funny little play bit .PERIOD 
just as a train is about to go ,COMMA a young couple rush in and they're just about to close the pneumatic doors .PERIOD 
you see ,COMMA here's huck ;SEMICOLON he's an illiterate kid ;SEMICOLON he's had no schooling ,COMMA but there's something in him .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA most actors want to do characters that are likeable - well ,COMMA not always ,COMMA but the notion ,COMMA especially at a conference like this ,COMMA i like to inspire people .PERIOD 
and i still feel as though i've got to get coffee for my male colleagues ,COMMA even though i've outlived most of them .PERIOD 
everything i do is word for word off a tape .PERIOD 
and it didn't work ,COMMA didn't work .PERIOD 
all around her head was just swollen ;SEMICOLON her head was about two sizes of its own size .PERIOD 
he says ,COMMA'she won't breathe .PERIOD' i knew immediately that she was dead .PERIOD 
i didn't even want to accept the fact that she was dead ,COMMA so i went in and i put a mirror to her mouth - there was no thing ,COMMA nothing ,COMMA coming out of her mouth .PERIOD 
he said ,COMMA he said ,COMMA he said ,COMMA'we can't ,COMMA we can't let nobody find out about this .PERIOD' he say ,COMMA'you've got to help me .PERIOD' i agree .PERIOD i agree .PERIOD 
and so i went to both - two race riots ,COMMA one of which was the los angeles riot .PERIOD and this next piece is from that .PERIOD 
and that trial came back with two cops going to jail and two cops declared innocent .PERIOD i was at that trial .PERIOD 
so what she's questioning here ,COMMA she's taking a chance and questioning what justice is in society .PERIOD 
we didn't qualify for medical treatment ,COMMA no food stamp ,COMMA no gr ,COMMA no welfare ,COMMA anything .PERIOD many african-americans who never work got minimum amount of money to survive .PERIOD 
we didn't get any because we have a car and a house .PERIOD 
and i wonder if that is really justice for them ,COMMA to get their rights in that way .PERIOD 
but after the riot ,COMMA it's too much difference .PERIOD 
the other reason that i don't wear shoes is just in case i really feel like i have to cuddle up and get into the feet of somebody ,COMMA walking really in somebody else's shoes .PERIOD 
i was in a doctor's office last cat scan ,COMMA and there was a reader's digest ,COMMA october <NUM> .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA like even when i told my wife that you want to come out here and talk to me ,COMMA she's like ,COMMA'she's just talking ;SEMICOLON she's just being nice to you .PERIOD she's not going to do that .PERIOD' and then you called me up and you said you wanted to come out here and interview me and she went and looked you up on the internet .PERIOD 
she said ,COMMA'look who she is .PERIOD 
freedom ?QUESTIONMARK it would have to be the rodeo .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA i guess it just be like - i guess it be like the day my brother died .PERIOD 
so check it ,COMMA i'm gon na to catch mockingbirds .PERIOD 
i'll get some asshole at a watering hole asking what brand the ice is .PERIOD 
i'll get the last time you lied .PERIOD 
i'll get a lonely ,COMMA little sentence with real error in it ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA i guess i could come inside ,COMMA but only for a minute .PERIOD 
what does a violin have to do with technology ?QUESTIONMARK 
the surface of the earth is absolutely riddled with holes ,COMMA and here we are ,COMMA right in the middle .PERIOD 
i'm on this'til the whole thing spreads ,COMMA with chat rooms and copycats and moms maybe tucking kids into bed singing ,COMMA hush ,COMMA little baby ,COMMA don't say a word .PERIOD 
wow .PERIOD 
now most media companies - television ,COMMA radio ,COMMA publishing ,COMMA games ,COMMA you name it - they use very rigid segmentation methods in order to understand their audiences .PERIOD 
and so the bizarre result of this is that most of our popular culture is actually based on these presumptions about our demographics .PERIOD 
now there's something else that we've discovered about social media that's actually quite surprising .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA i actually don't think that's going to be the case .PERIOD 
this is far too simplistic .PERIOD 
so you may be asking ,COMMA well why is it important that i know what entertains people ?QUESTIONMARK 
so imagine a media atmosphere that isn't dominated by lame stereotypes about gender and other demographic characteristics .PERIOD 
thank you so much .PERIOD 
and she went to a neurologist who was fascinated .PERIOD 
and the amazing thing to me is that now you would think this woman would like have excellent oral hygiene .PERIOD 
i interviewed ,COMMA when i was working on the book ,COMMA i interviewed a woman who can think herself to orgasm .PERIOD 
it was remarkable .PERIOD it took about one minute .PERIOD 
and it is a fact that you can trigger spinal reflexes in dead people - a certain kind of dead person ,COMMA a beating-heart cadaver .PERIOD 
obviously it wouldn't be as much fun for the person .PERIOD 
you know ?QUESTIONMARK you can get cadavers if you work at a university .PERIOD 
according to <NUM> marriage manual author ,COMMA theodoor van de velde ,COMMA a slight seminal odor can be detected on the breath of a woman within about an hour after sexual intercourse .PERIOD 
but he wrote in this book ,COMMA ideal marriage - he said that he could differentiate between the semen of a young man ,COMMA which he said had a fresh ,COMMA exhilarating smell ,COMMA and the semen of mature men ,COMMA whose semen smelled quote ,COMMA remarkably like that of the flowers of the spanish chestnut .PERIOD 
and lo and behold ,COMMA the hiccups went away .PERIOD 
it was called the upsuck theory .PERIOD 
this is the <NUM> .PERIOD 
i have an answer for you .PERIOD i have two answers .PERIOD 
so now you have an evolutionary excuse .PERIOD 
alrighty .PERIOD there is considerable evidence for upsuck in the animal kingdom - pigs ,COMMA for instance .PERIOD 
and i also said to her ,COMMA now these sows .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA you may have noticed there ,COMMA the sow doesn't look to be in the throes of ecstasy .PERIOD 
this is the ejaculation face of the stump-tailed macaque .PERIOD 
this is basically a penis camera on a motor .PERIOD 
and in fact he found that in three quarters of the men the stuff just kind of slopped out .PERIOD 
and that furthers the isolation that people like john found themselves in .PERIOD 
but after having lost a beloved teacher in <NUM> and a good friend last year to suicide ,COMMA and sitting last year at tedactive ,COMMA i knew that i needed to step out of my silence and past my taboos to talk about an idea worth spreading - and that is that people who have made the difficult choice to come back to life need more resources and need our help .PERIOD 
this is the way that most of us were taught to tie our shoes .PERIOD 
and here's how to tell .PERIOD 
it will let you down less ,COMMA and not only that ,COMMA it looks better .PERIOD 
live long and prosper .PERIOD 
it's called tidying up art and it's ,COMMA as you can see ,COMMA it's more or less a picture book .PERIOD 
i'd like to show them around so we can just ,COMMA you know - actually ,COMMA i managed to prepare for you some enlarged pictures - even better .PERIOD 
and we can see here very clearly ,COMMA it's a confusion of color .PERIOD 
the various pictures here of the various elements of the picture - the whole thing is unstructured .PERIOD 
yeah ,COMMA that's great .PERIOD 
you can see now ,COMMA that's a good example :COLON even behaving in an orderly ,COMMA systematic way can sometimes lead to complete chaos .PERIOD 
that's a picture by keith haring .PERIOD 
in the end ,COMMA one has a list with which one then can arrange .PERIOD 
tidying up rene magritte - this is really fun .PERIOD 
like books ,COMMA clothes ,COMMA toothbrush ,COMMA etc .PERIOD and it was great .PERIOD 
but then one morning ,COMMA i hang the same little sign onto that picture by vincent van gogh .PERIOD 
here - that's just my new proposal here for the union jack .PERIOD 
yeah ,COMMA i think ,COMMA after you have seen that i have to leave anyway .PERIOD 
one is hierarchical pores ,COMMA and the other is a macro-molecular nanoscale porosity in the material .PERIOD 
machines are becoming devastatingly capable of things like killing .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK 
those machines have no place for empathy .PERIOD 
which was the basis of the movie bladerunner .PERIOD 
even if you just try to get all of those ideas into your head by watching all those thousand ted videos ,COMMA it would actually currently take you over <NUM> hours to do so .PERIOD 
each of those tedtalks has an average length of about <NUM> words .PERIOD 
or living in existential vacuum ;SEMICOLON it sucks .PERIOD 
i mean .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA dan pink's talk on motivation ,COMMA which was pretty good if you haven't seen it :COLON drop carrot .PERIOD drop stick .PERIOD bring meaning .PERIOD 
even then ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA it's not possible to summarize each tedtalk individually .PERIOD 
i don't know any tedtalk that contains this .PERIOD 
i had started out with a thousand tedtalks and i had <NUM> six-word summaries for those .PERIOD 
so i thought ,COMMA i probably have to take this one step further here and create summaries of the summaries - and this is exactly what i did .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA he's discovering the garden .PERIOD 
his face ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA is fully ai-driven .PERIOD 
now we need to have a bit more engagement ,COMMA and again ,COMMA what we can do is we can look at the body .PERIOD 
you stand up ,COMMA and you skim the stone .PERIOD 
and we're going to help him with this now .PERIOD 
but this is going to be an introduction ,COMMA and this is all about the deep psychology that we're trying to use .PERIOD 
we're trying to introduce you to what i believe is the most wonderful part ,COMMA you being able to talk in your natural voice to milo .PERIOD 
he's just moved house .PERIOD he's got no friends .PERIOD 
they're always getting stressed .PERIOD 
milo :COLON i just really miss my old house ,COMMA that's all .PERIOD 
but for me ,COMMA this is a wonderful opportunity where technology ,COMMA at last ,COMMA can be connected with ,COMMA where i am no longer restrained by the finger i hold in my hand - as far as a computer game's concerned - or by the blandness of not being noticed if you're watching a film or a book .PERIOD 
each of you possesses the most powerful ,COMMA dangerous and subversive trait that natural selection has ever devised .PERIOD 
i'm talking about your language ,COMMA of course ,COMMA because it allows you to implant a thought from your mind directly into someone else's mind ,COMMA and they can attempt to do the same to you ,COMMA without either of you having to perform surgery .PERIOD 
and just imagine the sense of wonder in a baby when it first discovers that ,COMMA merely by uttering a sound ,COMMA it can get objects to move across a room as if by magic ,COMMA and maybe even into its mouth .PERIOD 
and this cumulative cultural adaptation ,COMMA as anthropologists call this accumulation of ideas ,COMMA is responsible for everything around you in your bustling and teeming everyday lives .PERIOD 
and this is also true of some remote oceanic islands .PERIOD 
this remarkable image is not a map of the world .PERIOD 
he thought ,COMMA oh ,COMMA i can renovate the school .PERIOD 
she found a job ,COMMA she scouted for jobs for her classmates and her friends .PERIOD 
she not only changed her own dynamic ,COMMA she changed her household ,COMMA she changed her family ,COMMA her village .PERIOD 
and that is that the central moral challenge of this century is gender inequity .PERIOD 
so some of you may be thinking ,COMMA gosh ,COMMA that's hyperbole .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it happens for several reasons .PERIOD 
there are three reasons why this is the case .PERIOD 
when you educate a girl ,COMMA she tends to have significantly fewer kids .PERIOD 
it's kind of like the dirty ,COMMA little secret of poverty ,COMMA which is that ,COMMA not only do poor people take in very little income ,COMMA but also ,COMMA the income that they take in ,COMMA they don't spend it very wisely ,COMMA and unfortunately ,COMMA most of that spending is done by men .PERIOD 
the last reason has to do with women being part of the solution ,COMMA not the problem .PERIOD 
he was speaking to an audience much like yourselves .PERIOD 
and that does not even include those that are trafficked within country borders ,COMMA which is a substantial portion .PERIOD 
she fought off the hyenas with that stick .PERIOD 
she's moved out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle .PERIOD 
let me tell you about saima .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA when she had to transport all of the embroidery goods from the village to the marketplace ,COMMA she needed someone to help her do the transport ,COMMA so she hired her husband .PERIOD 
a few yards away was a failed chicken coop .PERIOD 
she never broke down .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA here's the cause .PERIOD 
join the movement .PERIOD 
you've all seen lots of articles on climate change ,COMMA and here's yet another new york times article ,COMMA just like every other darn one you've seen .PERIOD 
and we've accomplished close to zip .PERIOD 
and there are times you might like to do something quick .PERIOD 
can you shade some sunlight and effectively compensate for the added co2 ,COMMA and produce a climate sort of back to what it was originally ?QUESTIONMARK 
and the answer seems to be yes .PERIOD 
it just sunk below the surface .PERIOD we weren't allowed to speak about it .PERIOD 
and in fact ,COMMA he had some ideas to make them go away .PERIOD 
but let's say you have sunlight hitting some particle and it's unevenly heated .PERIOD 
so the side facing the sun is warmer ;SEMICOLON the side away ,COMMA cooler .PERIOD 
and so you see a net force away from the sun .PERIOD 
because we have no way to agree about where to set the knobs .PERIOD 
we need a broader debate .PERIOD 
let's say that we don't do geo-engineering ,COMMA we do what we ought to do ,COMMA which is get serious about cutting emissions .PERIOD 
but i have a lot of reservations .PERIOD 
and it's time to begin thinking about it ,COMMA even if the reason we're thinking about it is to construct arguments for why we shouldn't do it .PERIOD 
and oddly ,COMMA the most notable letter of rejection i ever received came from walt disney world ,COMMA a seemingly innocuous site .PERIOD 
and i wanted to see the center with my own eyes ,COMMA but what i came away with is a photograph .PERIOD 
and it's just another place from which to observe ,COMMA and the understanding that there are no absolute ,COMMA all-knowing insiders .PERIOD 
in this context i'll just show you a few .PERIOD 
this is a cryopreservation unit ,COMMA and it holds the bodies of the wife and mother of cryonics pioneer robert ettinger ,COMMA who hoped to be awoken one day to extended life in good health ,COMMA with advancements in science and technology ,COMMA all for the cost of <NUM> thousand dollars ,COMMA for forever .PERIOD 
and in this i really wanted it to resemble an early still-life painting ,COMMA so i spent some time with the smells and items .PERIOD 
and the film was shot on <NUM> millimeter ,COMMA government-issue film .PERIOD 
i investigate photography's ability to blur truth and fiction ,COMMA and its influence on memory ,COMMA which can lead to severe ,COMMA even lethal consequences .PERIOD 
a victim or eyewitness identifies a suspected perpetrator through law enforcement's use of images .PERIOD 
but through exposure to composite sketches ,COMMA polaroids ,COMMA mug shots and line-ups ,COMMA eyewitness testimony can change .PERIOD 
and he served <NUM> years of a life sentence .PERIOD 
ron williamson .PERIOD ron was convicted of the rape and murder of a barmaid at a club ,COMMA and served <NUM> years of a death sentence .PERIOD 
ronald jones served eight years of a death sentence for rape and murder of a 28-year-old woman .PERIOD 
some people say this is because we have better diagnosis ,COMMA and more people are being found out .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA these two show great growth in income ,COMMA absolutely flat happiness curves .PERIOD 
my field ,COMMA the field of psychology ,COMMA hasn't done a whole lot to help us move forward in understanding human happiness .PERIOD 
emotions are short-lived intense responses to challenge and to opportunity .PERIOD 
and each one of them allows us to click into alternate selves that tune in ,COMMA turn on ,COMMA drop out thoughts ,COMMA perceptions ,COMMA feelings and memories .PERIOD 
we've come away from the freudian gloom ,COMMA and people are now actively studying this .PERIOD 
absent from this list ,COMMA and absent from any discussions of happiness ,COMMA are happiness in another's happiness .PERIOD 
babies love the taste of sweet and hate the taste of bitter .PERIOD 
babies really are born with a lot of innate pleasures .PERIOD 
it turned out that it wasn't ,COMMA that it really is a system of motivation ,COMMA a system of wanting .PERIOD 
there is a profound need to belong .PERIOD 
but there are ways in which our evolutionary history can really trip us up .PERIOD 
so for example we have three systems that underlie reproduction ,COMMA because it's so important .PERIOD 
there's attachment ,COMMA which is oxytocin ,COMMA and the opiates ,COMMA which says ,COMMA this is a long-term bond .PERIOD 
so a person can be in a long term attachment ,COMMA become romantically infatuated with someone else ,COMMA and want to have sex with a third person .PERIOD 
so if you look at questions like this ,COMMA life satisfaction ,COMMA you see life satisfaction going up with each rung of income .PERIOD 
you see mental distress going up with lower income .PERIOD 
but the effect is relatively small .PERIOD 
and sure enough ,COMMA if you look at the kinds of values that come in ,COMMA you see wealth ,COMMA adventure ,COMMA achievement ,COMMA pleasure ,COMMA fun ,COMMA be respected ,COMMA before the change ,COMMA and much more post-materialist values after .PERIOD 
i had all kinds of rats ,COMMA mice ,COMMA hamsters ,COMMA gerbils ,COMMA squirrels .PERIOD 
growing up in a multicultural environment ,COMMA we had african students in the house ,COMMA and i learned about their stories ,COMMA so different backgrounds ,COMMA dependency on imported know-how ,COMMA goods ,COMMA services ,COMMA exuberant cultural diversity .PERIOD 
princess diana is announcing on tv that landmines form a structural barrier to any development ,COMMA which is really true .PERIOD 
and actually ,COMMA our product - what you see here .PERIOD 
rats have been used since the <NUM> last century ,COMMA in all kinds of experiments .PERIOD 
rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species .PERIOD 
so in our common language ,COMMA dutch ,COMMA the name for t.b .PERIOD 
it gets a click sound and comes for the food reward .PERIOD 
and by doing so ,COMMA very fast ,COMMA we can have like a second-line opinion to see which patients are positive ,COMMA which are negative .PERIOD 
just as an indication ,COMMA whereas a microscopist can process <NUM> samples in a day ,COMMA a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only .PERIOD 
but let's stick first to tuberculosis .PERIOD 
throughout last year ,COMMA we've been - depending on which intervals you take - we've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in dar es salaam between <NUM> and <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
and there are simple things like ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds .PERIOD 
also ,COMMA to standardize the pellets ,COMMA the food rewards ,COMMA and to semi-automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people .PERIOD 
here is a first prototype of our camera rat ,COMMA which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA how do you go about studying the brain ?QUESTIONMARK 
now ,COMMA one recent discovery that has been made by researchers in italy ,COMMA in parma ,COMMA by giacomo rizzolatti and his colleagues ,COMMA is a group of neurons called mirror neurons ,COMMA which are on the front of the brain in the frontal lobes .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA here is a neuron that fires when i reach and grab something ,COMMA but it also fires when i watch joe reaching and grabbing something .PERIOD 
it's almost as though it's performing a virtual reality simulation of the other person's action .PERIOD 
for one thing they must be involved in things like imitation and emulation .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA how do you do imitation ?QUESTIONMARK why is imitation important ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i claim that what happened was the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system ,COMMA which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people's actions .PERIOD 
a human being ,COMMA a child ,COMMA can just watch its parent kill another polar bear ,COMMA and skin it and put the skin on its body ,COMMA fur on the body ,COMMA and learn it in one step .PERIOD what the polar bear took <NUM> years to learn ,COMMA it can learn in five minutes ,COMMA maybe <NUM> minutes .PERIOD 
it emerges from our understanding of basic neuroscience .PERIOD 
for the longest time people have regarded science and humanities as being distinct .PERIOD 
pollen is a flower's way of making more flowers .PERIOD 
here is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen .PERIOD 
the little hole in the middle ,COMMA we'll come to a bit later ,COMMA but that's for the pollen tube to come out later on .PERIOD a very tiny tube .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA that's <NUM> micrometers across ,COMMA that pollen grain there .PERIOD 
it's also very biologically active ,COMMA as anyone with hay fever will understand .PERIOD 
and the reason for that is they've got to chuck out masses and masses of pollen to have any chance of the pollen reaching another plant of the same species .PERIOD 
again - this time ,COMMA sycamore - wind-dispersed .PERIOD 
cool pollen ,COMMA though .PERIOD 
remember ,COMMA that thing is just about <NUM> micrometers across .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA it's much more efficient if you can get insects to do your bidding .PERIOD 
the pollen has little barbs on it ,COMMA if we look .PERIOD 
that tells me that it's actually been fossilized ,COMMA this pollen .PERIOD 
isn't that cool ?QUESTIONMARK 
and this is where it gets interesting for forensics .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA not only does each type of pollen look different ,COMMA but each habitat has a different combination of plants .PERIOD 
this is some pollen embedded in a cotton shirt ,COMMA similar to the one that i'm wearing now .PERIOD 
and that is the <NUM> years that women have advocated .PERIOD 
we have effective therapies now .PERIOD 
why are more and more women dying of ischemic heart disease ?QUESTIONMARK 
so in the wise ,COMMA <NUM> years ago ,COMMA we started out and said ,COMMA well wow ,COMMA there's a couple of key observations and we should probably follow up on that .PERIOD 
had recently published that when women have heart attacks and die ,COMMA compared to men who have heart attacks and die - and again ,COMMA this is millions of people ,COMMA happening every day - women ,COMMA in their fatty plaque - and this is their coronary artery ,COMMA so the main blood supply going into the heart muscle - women erode ,COMMA men explode .PERIOD 
ekg goes pbbrrhh ,COMMA so the doctors can see this hugely abnormal ekg .PERIOD 
so what do you think happens to these gals ?QUESTIONMARK 
so unlike the cat scans ,COMMA x-rays ,COMMA thalliums ,COMMA for women whose breast is in the way of looking at the heart ,COMMA every time we order something that has even a small amount of radiation ,COMMA we say ,COMMA do we really need that test ?QUESTIONMARK 
and those little red boxes are deaths .PERIOD 
one of the things that we say about all of this female physiology - because again ,COMMA as much as we're talking about women and heart disease ,COMMA women do ,COMMA on average ,COMMA have better longevity than men - is that unfolding the secrets of female physiology and understanding that is going to help men and women .PERIOD 
so we're <NUM> years behind .PERIOD 
women participate .PERIOD 
deb roy :COLON this moment and thousands of other moments special for us were captured in our home because in every room in the house ,COMMA if you looked up ,COMMA you'd see a camera and a microphone ,COMMA and if you looked down ,COMMA you'd get this bird's-eye view of the room .PERIOD 
this is my wife and i cooking breakfast in the kitchen ,COMMA and as we move through space and through time ,COMMA a very everyday pattern of life in the kitchen .PERIOD 
in order to convert this opaque ,COMMA <NUM> hours of video into something that we could start to see ,COMMA we use motion analysis to pull out ,COMMA as we move through space and through time ,COMMA what we call space-time worms .PERIOD 
no video here ,COMMA so you can focus on the sound ,COMMA the acoustics ,COMMA of a new kind of trajectory :COLON gaga to water .PERIOD 
this is one of the first results that came out of our study a little over a year ago that really surprised us .PERIOD 
so it appears that all three primary caregivers - myself ,COMMA my wife and our nanny - were systematically and ,COMMA i would think ,COMMA subconsciously restructuring our language to meet him at the birth of a word and bring him gently into more complex language .PERIOD 
what about the visual context ?QUESTIONMARK 
and there's our nanny by the door .PERIOD 
and what we've done is use the word water to tag that moment ,COMMA that bit of activity .PERIOD 
three of the key people in this project ,COMMA philip decamp ,COMMA rony kubat and brandon roy are pictured here .PERIOD 
each of the links that you're seeing rendered here is an actual connection made between something someone said and a piece of content .PERIOD 
we call this a co-viewing clique ,COMMA a virtual living room if you will .PERIOD 
and there are fascinating dynamics at play .PERIOD 
so this person is a key link in connecting mass media and social media together .PERIOD 
come here .PERIOD 
oh ,COMMA boy .PERIOD 
and primary visual cortex sees just simple geometry ,COMMA just the simplest of shapes .PERIOD 
and this is the part of the brain that will recognize what something is .PERIOD 
you'd be activating the dorsal stream if you did that .PERIOD 
and it's the part that feels .PERIOD 
now we've augmented this and spatialized this information .PERIOD 
we make meaning by seeing ,COMMA by an act of visual interrogation .PERIOD 
this is a time-lapse view of it .PERIOD 
and this is an emerging set of technologies that use large-screen displays with intelligent calculation in the background to make the invisible visible .PERIOD 
you can see the three-light transom there with the eyebrow windows - certainly an architectural antique headed to the landfill .PERIOD 
even the lockset is probably worth <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
then ,COMMA looking up in the turret ,COMMA you see there are bulges and pokes and sags and so forth .PERIOD 
then ,COMMA on the can it says ,COMMA this is the famous budweiser beer ,COMMA we know of no other beer ,COMMA blah ,COMMA blah ,COMMA blah .PERIOD 
this little house here ,COMMA those branches there are made out of bois d'arc or osage orange ,COMMA and these pictures will keep scrolling as i talk a little bit .PERIOD 
that's one of those new chocolate cell phones .PERIOD 
it only rattles that expected pattern and unity of structural features .PERIOD 
on the one hand ,COMMA we have an apollonian perspective ,COMMA which is very crisp and premeditated and intellectualized and perfect .PERIOD 
the dionysian personality takes the picture and goes .PERIOD 
oops ,COMMA scratch ,COMMA dumpster .PERIOD 
and here's a story :COLON jim tulles ,COMMA one of the guys i trained ,COMMA i said ,COMMA jim ,COMMA it's time now .PERIOD 
jim ,COMMA now it's time .PERIOD you're the down ,COMMA oh .PERIOD 
good call ,COMMA tulles .PERIOD from now on ,COMMA you guys hit this pile first .PERIOD 
but once in a while you get access to the control room ,COMMA and then you can kind of mess with the dials .PERIOD 
how disgusting .PERIOD 
it's a pretty quick read .PERIOD 
but as soon as you walk in ,COMMA i go ,COMMA ooh .PERIOD spaghetti sauce there .PERIOD 
i feel that expectation ,COMMA and so i accommodate it ,COMMA and i'm living my life according to what you expect me to do .PERIOD 
wildebeests don't hang with lions because lions eat wildebeests .PERIOD 
and so you see this in junior high a lot .PERIOD 
on the bottom tier we have basic needs - shelter ,COMMA clothing ,COMMA food ,COMMA water ,COMMA mating and so forth .PERIOD 
we can't even afford to eat anything except beans .PERIOD 
we're in trouble .PERIOD 
and it raises an existential question ,COMMA which is ,COMMA if i'm having this experience of complete connection and full consciousness ,COMMA why am i not visible in the photograph ,COMMA and where is this time and place ?QUESTIONMARK 
this is a police photo .PERIOD that's actually my car .PERIOD 
i'm put on full life support ,COMMA and i have a massive stroke ,COMMA and my brain drops into a coma .PERIOD 
and this is how we began .PERIOD 
now you also continue to watch as consciousness evolved to the point that here in india ,COMMA in madhya pradesh ,COMMA there's one of the two oldest known pieces of rock art found .PERIOD 
while i was producing in los angeles ,COMMA i never thought about it for a second .PERIOD 
here's my brain .PERIOD 
and this person is particularly interesting .PERIOD 
the craniomandibular system is critical to that .PERIOD 
if that sounds like a very ,COMMA very strange thing to say and rather a bold statement - how can the jaw affect the entire body ?QUESTIONMARK - let me simply point out to you ,COMMA if i ask you tomorrow to put one grain of sand between your teeth and go for a nice long walk ,COMMA how far would you last before you had to remove that grain of sand ?QUESTIONMARK 
that tiny misalignment .PERIOD 
bear in mind ,COMMA there are no nerves in the teeth .PERIOD 
that's why the same between the before and after that this shows ,COMMA it's hard to see the difference .PERIOD 
this is an mri mra mrv ,COMMA a volumetric mri .PERIOD 
i've brought with me ,COMMA from southern california ,COMMA the fm device .PERIOD 
and when i came out of my coma ,COMMA i recognized my family ,COMMA but i didn't remember my own past .PERIOD 
and i whispered the good news through my broken jaw ,COMMA which was wired shut ,COMMA to my night nurse .PERIOD 
and during my time in coma ,COMMA she had been laid to rest in her hometown of phoenix .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA when i heard simon's - please sit down ;SEMICOLON i just want to talk to him for a second - when i read his book ,COMMA i went to la to meet him .PERIOD 
the thing that amazed me is the painstaking detail with which he has written every hospital he has been to ,COMMA every treatment he got ,COMMA every near-miss he had ,COMMA and how accidentally he stumbled upon innovations .PERIOD 
tell a little bit about what you're wearing on your leg .PERIOD 
because the chimpanzee would score half right if i gave them two bananas with sri lanka and turkey .PERIOD they would be right half of the cases .PERIOD 
i did also an unethical study of the professors of the karolinska institute - that hands out the nobel prize in medicine ,COMMA and they are on par with the chimpanzee there .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA i first discovered that the textbook was tintin ,COMMA mainly .PERIOD 
and what do you mean with western world ?QUESTIONMARK i said .PERIOD 
and <NUM> ,COMMA there was really a group of countries here that was industrialized countries ,COMMA and they had small families and long lives .PERIOD 
one dollar ,COMMA <NUM> dollars or <NUM> dollars per day .PERIOD 
there's a little hump here .PERIOD but there are people all the way .PERIOD 
we heard it in other forms .PERIOD and who are these ?QUESTIONMARK 
where are the different countries ?QUESTIONMARK i can show you africa .PERIOD 
the problem in the world was the poverty in asia .PERIOD and if i now let the world move forward ,COMMA you will see that while population increase ,COMMA there are hundreds of millions in asia getting out of poverty and some others getting into poverty ,COMMA and this is the pattern we have today .PERIOD 
i can go here and i can split sub-saharan africa into its countries .PERIOD 
and when it burst ,COMMA the size of its country bubble is the size of the population .PERIOD 
today ,COMMA we don't have to go to cuba to find a healthy country in latin america .PERIOD 
the richest <NUM> percent of ugandans are there .PERIOD 
and we started to write software which could link the data like this .PERIOD 
so i first went to copenhagen because i thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA maybe i could become a biochemist ,COMMA but i discovered biochemistry was very boring .PERIOD 
but wilkins ,COMMA you know ,COMMA thought dna was the best bet ,COMMA and he showed this x-ray photograph .PERIOD 
and there i met francis crick .PERIOD 
i went there without knowing him .PERIOD he was <NUM> .PERIOD i was <NUM> .PERIOD 
and within a day ,COMMA we had decided that maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of dna .PERIOD 
and the reason for doing so ,COMMA at the center of this photograph ,COMMA is linus pauling .PERIOD about six months before ,COMMA he proposed the alpha helical structure for proteins .PERIOD and in doing so ,COMMA he banished the man out on the right ,COMMA sir lawrence bragg ,COMMA who was the cavendish professor .PERIOD 
this is a photograph several years later ,COMMA when bragg had cause to smile .PERIOD 
and they had the wisdom to say no .PERIOD so he didn't have it .PERIOD 
but there was ones in the literature .PERIOD 
so this was ,COMMA you know ,COMMA unexpected from the world's - - and so ,COMMA it was held together by hydrogen bonds between phosphate groups .PERIOD 
and a month after we got the pauling manuscript - i should say i took the manuscript to london ,COMMA and showed the people .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA we got the answer on the <NUM> february <NUM> .PERIOD 
so i changed the locations ,COMMA and then we found the base pairing ,COMMA and francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions .PERIOD 
so we saw how genetic information is carried .PERIOD 
it didn't yield .PERIOD it didn't give good x-ray photographs .PERIOD 
it was really ,COMMA you know ,COMMA sort of a shitty time .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA at that time - i should go back .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA they learned how to read the letters for the code .PERIOD 
there's a chip there ,COMMA a conventional one .PERIOD then there's one made by a photolithography by a company in madison called nimblegen ,COMMA which is way ahead of affymetrix .PERIOD 
and we use their technique .PERIOD 
which is ,COMMA all of us have about <NUM> places in our genome where we've lost a gene or gained another one .PERIOD 
actually ,COMMA it's a really big idea .PERIOD 
and they were going to spend the rest of their lives ,COMMA usually ,COMMA in this iron lung to breathe for them .PERIOD 
and it happened so fast in the united states ,COMMA however ,COMMA that even just last month jon stewart said this :COLON jon stewart :COLON where is polio still active ?QUESTIONMARK 
they had come from thousands of miles away .PERIOD 
it doesn't survive in the environment hardly at all .PERIOD 
and we've got pretty good vaccines ,COMMA as i've just showed you .PERIOD 
so those are the kind of stakes that we're after .PERIOD 
so it was a massive effort .PERIOD 
we've had to create one of the largest social movements in history .PERIOD 
now giving the polio vaccine is simple .PERIOD 
now it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication - more than <NUM> years ,COMMA much longer than it should have - but once it was built ,COMMA the results were striking .PERIOD 
last year ,COMMA it was <NUM> .PERIOD 
we should abandon this idea of eradication .PERIOD 
let's settle for control - that's good enough .PERIOD 
umar was paralyzed for life .PERIOD 
as you probably can't see the detail here ,COMMA but this is his report card ,COMMA and you'll see ,COMMA he's got perfect scores .PERIOD 
but you know i'd love to be able to tell you that umar is a typical kid with polio these days ,COMMA but it's not true .PERIOD 
the new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had ,COMMA and we immediately started using this .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA in a couple of months we had to get it out of production .PERIOD 
and we didn't start with the easy places .PERIOD 
so this morning at about seven o'clock ,COMMA i decided that we'd try to drive chris and the production crew here berserk by downloading all of our data from india again ,COMMA so that you could see something that's just unfolding today ,COMMA which proves that the impossible is possible .PERIOD 
today marks exactly six months - and for the first time in history ,COMMA not a single child has been paralyzed in uttar pradesh or bihar .PERIOD 
we have the chance to write an entirely new polio-free chapter in human history .PERIOD 
beverly joubert :COLON we are truly passionate about the african wilderness and protecting the african wilderness ,COMMA and so what we've done is we've focused on iconic cats .PERIOD 
but one of the things that science really lets us down on is that personality ,COMMA that individual personality that these animals have .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA we needn't have worried .PERIOD 
and we could only find this by pushing ourselves ,COMMA by going where no sane person should go - not without some prompting ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA from beverly - and just pushing the envelope ,COMMA going out there ,COMMA pushing our vehicle ,COMMA pushing ourselves .PERIOD 
we don't always get that right ,COMMA and on this particular day ,COMMA we seriously underestimated the depth .PERIOD 
but that's ,COMMA i think ,COMMA what this is all about ,COMMA is that these individuals have these personalities and characters .PERIOD 
sleep deprivation is extreme .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA for <NUM> years ,COMMA we tried to capture lions and elephants together - and never ever managed until this particular night .PERIOD 
this elephant ,COMMA against overwhelming odds ,COMMA simply gives up hope .PERIOD 
but by the same token ,COMMA you can get your hope back again .PERIOD 
beverly sits on the one side where all her camera gear is ,COMMA and i'm on the other side where my space is .PERIOD 
these are precious to us ,COMMA these divides .PERIOD 
but when this little cub saw that i had vacated my seat and climbed to the back to get some camera gear ,COMMA she came in like a curious cat to come and investigate .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA we knew now that she was going to survive .PERIOD 
it was absolutely amazing when she picked it up to safety ,COMMA protecting it from the hyena .PERIOD 
but i have to tell you - everybody always asks ,COMMA what happened to the baby baboon ?QUESTIONMARK 
we had to deal with these individual personalities .PERIOD 
there's an immense amount of poaching as well ,COMMA and so possibly the same amount .PERIOD 
richard feynman compared the accuracy of quantum theories - experimental predictions - to specifying the width of north america to within one hair's breadth of accuracy .PERIOD 
and the familiar illustration is the nucleus of an atom is a fly in the middle of a sports stadium and the next atom is in the next sports stadium .PERIOD 
as an evolutionary biologist ,COMMA i'd say this :COLON our brains have evolved to help us survive within the orders of magnitude of size and speed which our bodies operate at .PERIOD we never evolved to navigate in the world of atoms .PERIOD 
moving to the other end of the scale ,COMMA our ancestors never had to navigate through the cosmos at speeds close to the speed of light .PERIOD if they had ,COMMA our brains would be much better at understanding einstein .PERIOD i want to give the name middle world to the medium-scaled environment in which we've evolved the ability to take act - nothing to do with middle earth .PERIOD 
he stared at his wall in arlington ,COMMA virginia ,COMMA and decided to do it .PERIOD 
then ,COMMA general stubblebine banged his nose hard on the wall of his office .PERIOD stubblebine ,COMMA who commanded <NUM> soldiers ,COMMA was confounded by his continual failure to walk through the wall .PERIOD 
i have every reason to think it's true ;SEMICOLON i was reading playboy because i ,COMMA myself ,COMMA had an article in it .PERIOD 
and that's because in middle world ,COMMA air friction is always there .PERIOD 
we have this tendency to think that only solid ,COMMA material things are really things at all .PERIOD waves of electromagnetic fluctuation in a vacuum seem unreal .PERIOD 
steve grand points out that you and i are ,COMMA ourselves ,COMMA more like a wave than a permanent thing .PERIOD 
after all ,COMMA you really were there at the time ,COMMA weren't you ?QUESTIONMARK 
not a single atom that is in your body today was there when that event took place .PERIOD matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you .PERIOD 
so really isn't a word that we should use with simple confidence .PERIOD 
the fact that the bat uses echoes in pitch darkness to input the current variables to its model ,COMMA while the swallow uses light ,COMMA is incidental .PERIOD 
haldane guesses that a dog would probably be able to place the acids in the order of their molecular weights by their smells ,COMMA just as a man could place a number of piano wires in the order of their lengths by means of their notes .PERIOD 
we're blind to all frequencies outside that ,COMMA unless we use instruments to help us .PERIOD 
one way to think about that is by counting planets .PERIOD 
in short ,COMMA when we're thinking like academics ,COMMA we regard people as elaborate and complicated machines ,COMMA like computers or cars ,COMMA but when we revert to being human we behave more like basil fawlty ,COMMA who ,COMMA we remember ,COMMA thrashed his car to teach it a lesson when it wouldn't start on gourmet night .PERIOD 
personification and the imputing of intentional purpose is such a brilliantly successful way to model humans ,COMMA it's hardly surprising the same modeling software often seizes control when we're trying to think about entities for which it's not appropriate ,COMMA like basil fawlty with his car or like millions of deluded people with the universe as a whole .PERIOD 
and so this basically led me to a subject called cymatics .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA cymatics is the process of visualizing sound by basically vibrating a medium such as sand or water ,COMMA as you can see there .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what excites me about cymatics ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's like a looking glass into a hidden world .PERIOD 
we can also use cymatics for healing and education .PERIOD 
this image here is created from a snippet of beethoven's ninth symphony playing through a cymatic device .PERIOD

narrator :COLON a word about galvao ,COMMA a very rare kind of bird native to brazil .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA most of you have figured out that this was a prank ,COMMA and actually a very ,COMMA very good one .PERIOD 
because what happens on a social network is you interact with the people that you have chosen to interact with .PERIOD 
and the reason it shouldn't be is that on any day you can go into trending topics .PERIOD 
now for me ,COMMA i'm surprised by this ,COMMA because this wasn't how the internet was supposed to be .PERIOD 
we're heading to the future of bits ,COMMA where everything is speedy ,COMMA it's weightless .PERIOD 
here's what i think is going on .PERIOD 
it includes things like the internet cables .PERIOD 
when we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible ,COMMA and we look at what actually happens ,COMMA we start realizing that the world doesn't work quite the same way that we think it does .PERIOD 
that's down to about <NUM> to <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
even within wikipedias ,COMMA where we're creating their own content online ,COMMA there's a heavy bias towards the place where a lot of the wikipedia authors are based ,COMMA rather than to the rest of the world .PERIOD 
you probably won't .PERIOD 
this is a team of bloggers from around the world .PERIOD 
but the more that i think about it ,COMMA the more that i think that a few things that we have learned along the way are interesting lessons for how we would rewire if we we wanted to use the web to have a wider world .PERIOD 
in this case - the map of the world at night by nasa - they're dark literally because of lack of electricity .PERIOD 
i'm also guessing that most of you don't even speak chinese - which is sort of sad if you think about it ,COMMA as it's now the most represented language on the internet .PERIOD 
they put it online for free .PERIOD 
my guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say .PERIOD 
and search is terrific if you know what you're looking for .PERIOD 
she has to know something about what stories are available .PERIOD 
i know amira .PERIOD 
he knows one world ,COMMA and he's finding a way to communicate it to another world ,COMMA both of which he has deep connections to .PERIOD 
and the house that john wilkes booth planned the assassination of abraham lincoln is actually also now a chinese restaurant called wok'n roll ,COMMA on h street in washington .PERIOD 
the short answer is ,COMMA actually ,COMMA they're from japan .PERIOD 
the original name in my book was actually called the long march of general tso ,COMMA and he has marched very far indeed ,COMMA because he is sweet ,COMMA he is fried ,COMMA and he is chicken - all things that americans love .PERIOD 
he's retired ,COMMA deaf and plays a lot of mahjong .PERIOD 
but in china ,COMMA this guy's actually known for war and not chicken .PERIOD 
i like to say chop suey's the biggest culinary joke that one culture has ever played on another ,COMMA because chop suey ,COMMA if you translate into chinese ,COMMA means tsap sui ,COMMA which ,COMMA if you translate back ,COMMA means odds and ends .PERIOD 
now back then ,COMMA the americans were not clamoring to eat chinese food .PERIOD 
there is west indian chinese food ,COMMA there's jamaican chinese food ,COMMA there is middle eastern chinese food ,COMMA there's mauritian chinese food .PERIOD 
this is a dish called magic bowl that i discovered .PERIOD 
they actually did so through a centralized headquarters out of illinois ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
it wasn't that ,COMMA so they're like ,COMMA ok ,COMMA let's look at television ,COMMA so they looked at an episode of lost .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i don't have a tv ,COMMA which makes me a freak ,COMMA but very productive ,COMMA and - - and this episode of lost ,COMMA i understand ,COMMA where the overweight guy has a lucky number which was not a lucky number ,COMMA which was how long they'd been on the island ,COMMA but they looked ,COMMA and the numbers did not match .PERIOD 
this actually is a slip that one of the winners had ,COMMA because the tennessee lottery security officials were like ,COMMA oh ,COMMA no - like ,COMMA this can't be true .PERIOD 
yeah .PERIOD so ,COMMA i went and started looking .PERIOD 
it was lunch ,COMMA it was take-out ,COMMA it was sit-down ,COMMA it was buffet ,COMMA it was three weeks ago ,COMMA it was three months ago .PERIOD 
this time ,COMMA i'm going to talk about mental illness .PERIOD 
not only would it lift ,COMMA but it might never return .PERIOD 
that always makes hair stand up and people shake a lot .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA they went to the police and they said ,COMMA we know that at the rome railroad station ,COMMA there are all these lost souls wandering around ,COMMA muttering gibberish .PERIOD can you bring one of them to us ?QUESTIONMARK 
that's not going to do anything terrible to him .PERIOD

finally ,COMMA i would schedule - all my major surgical cases ,COMMA i was scheduling them for <NUM> ,COMMA one o'clock in the afternoon ,COMMA because i couldn't get out of bed before about <NUM> o'clock .PERIOD 
and my colleagues ,COMMA who had known me since medical school in that place ,COMMA said ,COMMA don't worry ,COMMA chap .PERIOD six weeks ,COMMA you're back in the operating room .PERIOD everything's going to be great .PERIOD 
you've seen this painting by edvard munch ,COMMA the scream .PERIOD every moment was a scream .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA as in all hospitals ,COMMA there was a resident assigned to my case .PERIOD he was <NUM> years old ,COMMA and he would meet with me two or three times a week .PERIOD 
any of the results along the spectrum ,COMMA from pretty bad to terrible ,COMMA terrible ,COMMA terrible is going to happen .PERIOD if he does the best he can ,COMMA he will have no further obsessions ,COMMA probably no depression ,COMMA but his affect will be dulled ,COMMA he will never go back to surgery ,COMMA he will never be the loving father that he was to his two children ,COMMA his life will be changed .PERIOD if he has the usual result ,COMMA he will end up like'one flew over the cuckoo's nest .PERIOD' and you know about that ,COMMA just essentially in a stupor the rest of his life .PERIOD 
plugged me into the wires ,COMMA put me to sleep ,COMMA gave me the muscle relaxant .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA lo and behold ,COMMA by <NUM> ,COMMA by <NUM> ,COMMA there were demonstrable differences in the way i felt .PERIOD 
it was as though those tightly coiled wires in my head had been disconnected and i could think clearly .PERIOD 
my children came back to live with us .PERIOD 
we had two more children after that .PERIOD 
it's been ,COMMA as i said ,COMMA close to <NUM> years .PERIOD 
every once in a while ,COMMA i get somewhat depressed and a little obsessional .PERIOD 
and i've always felt guilty about that .PERIOD 
i hope it happens to none of you ,COMMA but it will probably happen to a small percentage of you .PERIOD 
would you describe that as global citizenship ?QUESTIONMARK 
i believe the concept of global citizenship will simply grow out of people talking to each other across continents .PERIOD 
but people get excited about this idea of global citizenship ,COMMA but then they get confused a bit again when they start thinking about patriotism ,COMMA and how to combine these two .PERIOD 
when you actually look at the motor of the world economy ,COMMA it cannot move forward unless there is trade between the different countries .PERIOD 
well i think we can persuade people that what is necessary for britain's long-term interests ,COMMA what is necessary for america's long-term interests ,COMMA is proper engagement with the rest of the world ,COMMA and taking the action that is necessary .PERIOD 
and we have got to realize that if we don't link up with those people who are sensible voices and democratic voices in africa ,COMMA to work together for common causes ,COMMA then the danger of al qaeda and related groups making progress in africa is very big .PERIOD 
and i wouldn't like anything that is said today to suggest that i am diminishing the importance of the responsibility that each individual leader has for their own country .PERIOD 
where was the early warning systems ?QUESTIONMARK 
all these things have happened .PERIOD 
even if ,COMMA as a human being ,COMMA you believe that ,COMMA you can't say that .PERIOD you're elected for britain's interests .PERIOD 
since then ,COMMA the world has moved forward ,COMMA partly as a result of what happened with the holocaust ,COMMA and people's concern about the rights of individuals within territories where they need protection ,COMMA partly because of what we saw in rwanda ,COMMA partly because of what we saw in bosnia .PERIOD 
the idea of the responsibility to protect all individuals who are in situations where they are at humanitarian risk is now being established as a principle which governs the world .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA while i can't automatically say that britain will rush to the aid of any citizen of any country ,COMMA in danger ,COMMA i can say that britain is in a position where we're working with other countries so that this idea that you have a responsibility to protect people who are victims of either genocide or humanitarian attack ,COMMA is something that is accepted by the whole world .PERIOD 
yes .PERIOD and then of course the theory is still that those talks get rent apart by different countries fighting over their own individual interests .PERIOD 
america has made its first disposition on this with the bill that president obama should be congratulated for getting through congress .PERIOD 
and god shook his head and said ,COMMA not this year ,COMMA not this decade ,COMMA perhaps not even in your lifetime .PERIOD 
and bill clinton walked away in tears because he had failed to get what he wanted .PERIOD 
so that's kind of a bold statement .PERIOD 
and it's technological ,COMMA so it can do things like microelectronics ,COMMA and maybe photonics do .PERIOD 
and the material looks something like this .PERIOD 
the process of discovery ,COMMA generally ,COMMA is inspired by nature .PERIOD 
they find their way to self-assemble .PERIOD 
and we can store information that's film with water and protein .PERIOD 
you can imagine that then maybe you can use a pure protein to guide light ,COMMA and so we've made optical fibers .PERIOD 
you can do electronic pieces that fold and wrap .PERIOD 
you can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted .PERIOD 
and you see there ,COMMA it gets reintegrated in tissue .PERIOD 
so you have a clock ,COMMA you have protein ,COMMA and now a silk cup like this can be thrown away without guilt - unlike the polystyrene cups that unfortunately fill our landfills everyday .PERIOD 
so it allows for the recovery of what we've stored before .PERIOD 
some people in the last decade or two have started creating artwork with technology .PERIOD 
you can learn something from the robot about the community that you're in .PERIOD 
you guys are looking good out there .PERIOD 
data :COLON here's the first one .PERIOD 
one of them falls to the ground .PERIOD 
i can help .PERIOD 
you've been a great audience .PERIOD 
there's a lot more to come .PERIOD 
then he said ,COMMA but really ,COMMA sarah ,COMMA you could have worked harder !EXCLAMATIONMARK can't you see it's really too small ?QUESTIONMARK 
indeed ,COMMA it's rather small .PERIOD 
one day ,COMMA while my father was working on a file for us to obtain french nationality ,COMMA i happened to see some documents that caught my attention .PERIOD 
these are real !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
so ,COMMA his story .PERIOD my father was born in argentina .PERIOD 
this coincided with the time when he threw himself body and soul into chemistry because it was the only consolation for his sadness .PERIOD 
it was my grandfather who decided they needed false documents .PERIOD 
but it was he who went to meet a man from the resistance .PERIOD 
in those times documents had hard covers ,COMMA they were filled in by hand ,COMMA and they stated your job .PERIOD 
he started inventing all kind of things - with some materials he invented a centrifuge using a bicycle wheel .PERIOD 
time passed ,COMMA and they thought he had surely forgotten them ,COMMA at first .PERIOD 
and then i understood that asking my father so many questions was stirring up a whole past he probably didn't feel like talking about because it was painful .PERIOD 
in africa there were countries fighting for their independence :COLON guinea ,COMMA guinea-bissau ,COMMA angola .PERIOD 
there was also latin america .PERIOD 
he said no .PERIOD 
we live on a human-dominated planet ,COMMA putting unprecedented pressure on the systems on earth .PERIOD 
this is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity in the global phase of sustainability .PERIOD 
so i thought i'd bring her with me today on stage ,COMMA to have her as a witness of a remarkable journey ,COMMA which humbly reminds us of the period of grace we've had over the past <NUM> years .PERIOD 
here ,COMMA used as a proxy ,COMMA temperature variability .PERIOD 
it was a jumpy ride .PERIOD <NUM> years back in a crisis ,COMMA we leave africa ,COMMA we colonize australia in another crisis ,COMMA <NUM> years back ,COMMA we leave asia for europe in another crisis ,COMMA <NUM> years back ,COMMA and then we enter the remarkably stable holocene phase ,COMMA the only period in the whole history of the planet ,COMMA that we know of ,COMMA that can support human development .PERIOD 
the majority of the planet ,COMMA aspiring for development ,COMMA having the right for development ,COMMA are in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle ,COMMA a momentous pressure .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA you would have wished the climate pressure to hit a strong planet ,COMMA a resilient planet ,COMMA but unfortunately ,COMMA the third pressure is the ecosystem decline .PERIOD 
and could we even ,COMMA thanks to major advancements in earth systems science ,COMMA identify the thresholds ,COMMA the points where we may expect nonlinear change ?QUESTIONMARK 
now this is the big bang equivalent then of human development within the safe operating space of the planetary boundaries .PERIOD 
in the <NUM> already ,COMMA through the green revolution and the haber-bosch process of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere - you know ,COMMA human's today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere than the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole .PERIOD 
there's good news here ,COMMA for example ,COMMA from latin america ,COMMA where plow-based farming systems of the <NUM> and <NUM> led farming basically to a dead-end ,COMMA with lower and lower yields ,COMMA degrading the organic matter and fundamental problems at the livelihood levels in paraguay ,COMMA uruguay and a number of countries ,COMMA brazil ,COMMA leading to innovation and entrepreneurship among farmers in partnership with scientists into an agricultural revolution of zero tillage systems combined with mulch farming with locally adapted technologies ,COMMA which today ,COMMA for example ,COMMA in some countries ,COMMA have led to a tremendous increase in area under mulch ,COMMA zero till farming which ,COMMA not only produces more food ,COMMA but also sequesters carbon .PERIOD 
it has to basically do this on current land .PERIOD 
elinor ostrom ,COMMA the latest nobel laureate of economics ,COMMA clearly shows empirically across the world that we can govern the commons if we invest in trust ,COMMA local ,COMMA action-based partnerships and cross-scale institutional innovations ,COMMA where local actors ,COMMA together ,COMMA can deal with the global commons at a large scale .PERIOD 
where you give the guaranteed price for investment in renewable energy ,COMMA but you can subsidize electricity to poor people .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA there is scientific evidence .PERIOD 
i was asked to come here and speak about creation .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA creation is what put that dog in that picture ,COMMA and creativity is what makes us see a chicken on his hindquarters .PERIOD 
and another point - why i'm here - is that the day i went to pick up the plexiglas trophy ,COMMA i rented a tuxedo for the first time in my life ,COMMA picked the thing - didn't have any friends .PERIOD 
somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles .PERIOD 
and that's how - with this money i paid for a ticket to come to the united states in <NUM> ,COMMA and that's very - the basic reason i'm talking to you here today :COLON because i got shot .PERIOD 
unfortunately ,COMMA it has become obsolete because it was designed for atari platform .PERIOD 
but i was still ,COMMA you know - this is a kitty cloud .PERIOD 
the snail .PERIOD 
and your eye doesn't know which level to read .PERIOD 
and they would look at it - ah ,COMMA it's a pencil drawing .PERIOD 
it had a physicality ,COMMA and you start going deeper and deeper into sort of narrative that goes this way ,COMMA towards the image .PERIOD so this is monkey with leica .PERIOD 
and i wanted to deal with other subjects .PERIOD 
i got some photographs from them .PERIOD 
and jackson pollock also .PERIOD 
i used the dust at the whitney museum to render some pieces of their collection .PERIOD 
and i picked minimalist pieces because they're about specificity .PERIOD 
they do a dna scan of this ,COMMA they will come up with a great mailing list .PERIOD 
also ,COMMA the reference to gerhard richter's use of color charts - and the idea also entering another realm of representation that's very common to us today ,COMMA which is the bit map .PERIOD 
i opt for very simple line drawings - kind of stupid looking .PERIOD 
on the other hand ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i paid like three dollars ,COMMA i think - and i went to a warehouse in queens to see a version of othello by an amateur group .PERIOD 
that's why we pay to go to magic shows and things like that .PERIOD 
and the information is there twice - one on each strand - which is important ,COMMA because when new cells are formed ,COMMA these strands come apart ,COMMA new strands are synthesized with the old ones as templates in an almost perfect process .PERIOD 
so an interesting question is ,COMMA what happened when we met ?QUESTIONMARK 
so this involves a lot of technical issues in how you extract the dna ,COMMA how you convert it to a form you can sequence .PERIOD 
the same is true if we look at a chinese individual versus an african ,COMMA the neanderthal will match the chinese individual more often .PERIOD 
and further back ,COMMA <NUM> years ago is there a common origin with present day humans .PERIOD 
but we do find it in papua new guinea and in other islands in melanesia and the pacific .PERIOD 
we don't know quite where the borders between these people were ,COMMA but we know that in southern siberia ,COMMA there were both neanderthals and denisovans at least at some time in the past .PERIOD 
and since we mixed elsewhere ,COMMA i'm pretty sure that one day ,COMMA when we will perhaps have a genome of also these earlier forms in africa ,COMMA we will find that they have also mixed with early modern humans in africa .PERIOD 
and if i were to write a volume ,COMMA it would be called ,COMMA artists who have led my exhibitions because my work ,COMMA in understanding art and in understanding culture ,COMMA has come by following artists ,COMMA by looking at what artists mean and what they do and who they are .PERIOD 
my overall project is about art - specifically ,COMMA about black artists - very generally about the way in which art can change the way we think about culture and ourselves .PERIOD 
what that might mean for cultural movements all over this moment ,COMMA the me ,COMMA we seems incredibly prescient totally important .PERIOD 
to this end ,COMMA the specific project that has made this possible for me is a series of exhibitions ,COMMA all titled with an f - freestyle ,COMMA frequency and flow - which have set out to discover and define the young ,COMMA black artists working in this moment who i feel strongly will continue to work over the next many years .PERIOD 
it is really in this sense of discovery that i have a new set of questions that i'm asking .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA really ,COMMA it has been what i've discovered about myself and what i can offer in the space of an exhibition ,COMMA to talk about beauty ,COMMA to talk about power ,COMMA to talk about ourselves ,COMMA and to talk and speak to each other .PERIOD 
and you put on the <NUM> parachute .PERIOD 
they give <NUM> minutes - that's a time warning .PERIOD 
and that's to boost everybody's confidence ,COMMA to show that you're not scared .PERIOD 
then they give you ,COMMA get ready .PERIOD 
so nice air comes flowing in .PERIOD 
so then you look around ,COMMA you're under a canopy and you say ,COMMA this is good .PERIOD 
in 30-some years of jumping ,COMMA i never did one .PERIOD 
and i realized that ,COMMA if they had to go into combat ,COMMA they would do what we had taught them and they would follow leaders .PERIOD 
so now i do that tuesday morning jump ,COMMA but it's not any jump - that was september <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD 
sort of leadership by humiliation .PERIOD 
i've got to use video teleconferences ,COMMA i've got to use chat ,COMMA i've got to use email ,COMMA i've got to use phone calls - i've got to use everything i can ,COMMA not just for communication ,COMMA but for leadership .PERIOD 
and that's a new kind of leadership for me .PERIOD 
so we had to get complex intelligence together ,COMMA we had to line up the ability to act .PERIOD 
in reality ,COMMA much of the force i led looked exactly like you .PERIOD 
and so instead of giving orders ,COMMA you're now building consensus and you're building a sense of shared purpose .PERIOD 
it also produced something which i call an inversion of expertise ,COMMA because we had so many changes at the lower levels in technology and tactics and whatnot ,COMMA that suddenly the things that we grew up doing wasn't what the force was doing anymore .PERIOD 
and it's a brand new leadership challenge .PERIOD 
and every morning in the ranger regiment ,COMMA every ranger - and there are more than <NUM> of them - says a six-stanza ranger creed .PERIOD 
and so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing .PERIOD 
that was my journey .PERIOD 
i came to believe that a leader isn't good because they're right ;SEMICOLON they're good because they're willing to learn and to trust .PERIOD 
alex steffen and i founded worldchanging in late <NUM> ,COMMA and since then we and our growing global team of contributors have documented the ever-expanding variety of solutions that are out there ,COMMA right now and on the near horizon .PERIOD 
as norwegian social scientist evelin lindner has observed ,COMMA pessimism is a luxury of good times .PERIOD 
in difficult times ,COMMA pessimism is a self-fulfilling ,COMMA self-inflicted death sentence .PERIOD 
community tools ,COMMA like text messaging ,COMMA that can tell you when pollen counts are up or smog levels are rising or a natural disaster is unfolding ,COMMA can give you the information you need to act in a timely fashion .PERIOD 
the political aspects of mobile phones can't be ignored either ,COMMA from text message swarms in korea helping to bring down a government ,COMMA to the blairwatch project in the uk ,COMMA keeping tabs on politicians who try to avoid the press .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA imagine a similar model for networking environmentalists .PERIOD 
imagine a web portal collecting recordings and evidence of what's happening to the planet :COLON putting news and data at the fingertips of people of all kinds ,COMMA from activists and researchers to businesspeople and political figures .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA just to be clear ,COMMA in this talk i'm using the name earth witness as part of the scenario ,COMMA simply as a shorthand ,COMMA for what this imaginary project could aspire to ,COMMA not to piggyback on the wonderful work of the witness organization .PERIOD 
earth witness would show us two worlds :COLON the world we're leaving behind ,COMMA and the world we're building for generations to come .PERIOD 
after this ,COMMA we noticed a couple of interesting things ,COMMA which you'll see .PERIOD 
make yourself understood to the computer .PERIOD 
and he couldn't travel ,COMMA so i went over there .PERIOD 
and all over india ,COMMA at the end of about two years ,COMMA children were beginning to google their homework .PERIOD 
they said ,COMMA yes ,COMMA we did .PERIOD 
so i said ,COMMA for two months ,COMMA you were looking at stuff you didn't understand ?QUESTIONMARK 
it took me three years to publish that .PERIOD 
i said ,COMMA no ,COMMA use the method of the grandmother .PERIOD 
what is that ?QUESTIONMARK can you do that again ?QUESTIONMARK can you show me some more ?QUESTIONMARK' she did that for two months .PERIOD 
the scores went up to <NUM> ,COMMA which is what the posh schools of new delhi ,COMMA with a trained biotechnology teacher were getting .PERIOD 
the first group - the best one - solved everything in <NUM> minutes .PERIOD 
the average score when i'd done it with the computers and the groups was <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
back at gateshead ,COMMA a 10-year-old girl gets into the heart of hinduism in <NUM> minutes .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA stuff which i don't know anything about .PERIOD 
this is a sole in newcastle .PERIOD 
i started writing english questions on the blackboard .PERIOD 
so you know what's happened ?QUESTIONMARK 
thanks .PERIOD 
i was too young ,COMMA unmarried ,COMMA i had no children ,COMMA didn't really know africa ,COMMA and besides ,COMMA my french was pitiful .PERIOD 
so then i went the whole american way ,COMMA with competitions ,COMMA team and individual .PERIOD completely failed ,COMMA but over time ,COMMA the women learnt to sell on their own way .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA blue ,COMMA blue ,COMMA everything became blue .PERIOD 
i think andrew pretty well covered that ,COMMA so i will move to the third point ,COMMA which is that markets alone also are not going to solve the problems of poverty .PERIOD 
both of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise ,COMMA and both of them ,COMMA because they're manufacturers ,COMMA create jobs directly ,COMMA and create incomes indirectly ,COMMA because they're in the malaria sector ,COMMA and africa loses about <NUM> billion dollars a year because of malaria .PERIOD 
and it's really time we start thinking more creatively about how they can be fused .PERIOD 
he was actually living in the kibera slums when his father called him and told him about artemisia and the value-add potential .PERIOD 
samuel's kids are in private school ,COMMA and he's starting to help other farmers in the area also go into artemisia production - dignity being more important than wealth .PERIOD 
the next one ,COMMA many of you know .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA from an enterprise perspective for africa ,COMMA and from a public health perspective ,COMMA these are real successes .PERIOD 
we can start building local distribution ,COMMA and actually ,COMMA it can cost the public sector much less .PERIOD 
one ,COMMA that people will pay different prices ,COMMA but the overwhelming number of people will come forth at one dollar per net and make a decision to buy it .PERIOD 
but what it takes is a commitment from all of us to essentially refuse trite assumptions ,COMMA get out of our ideological boxes .PERIOD 
and we came up with some parameters ,COMMA because ,COMMA you know ,COMMA building a rube goldberg machine has limitations ,COMMA but it also is pretty wide open .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect .PERIOD 
of those <NUM> takes ,COMMA only three actually successfully completed their run .PERIOD 
and the wonderful elation that we had when we finally completed it .PERIOD 
it think we can do better than this .PERIOD hello tedxusc .PERIOD 
let me start again .PERIOD 
where it goes in the future is questioned .PERIOD so that's the human part .PERIOD 
and in that <NUM> percent ,COMMA the main focus is on human mind ,COMMA thinking skills ,COMMA somehow trying to unleash kids from the straightjacket of school ,COMMA which is putting information and dogma into them ,COMMA get them so they really think ,COMMA ask tough questions ,COMMA argue about serious subjects ,COMMA don't believe everything that's in the book ,COMMA think broadly or creative .PERIOD they can be .PERIOD 
here's a giant flying replica of a pterosaur that has no tail .PERIOD 
this was the full size of the original creature .PERIOD 
it sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator .PERIOD 
buckminster fuller said it clearly :COLON there are no passengers on spaceship earth ,COMMA only crew .PERIOD we ,COMMA the crew ,COMMA can and must do more with less - much less .PERIOD 
it's amazing :COLON just on the puny power of the sun - by having a super lightweight plane ,COMMA you're able to get it up there .PERIOD 
we couldn't bring one here to fly it and show you .PERIOD 
but there's a lot of technology going .PERIOD 
sorry .PERIOD 
it never makes a mistake .PERIOD because if you make a mistake ,COMMA you don't leave any progeny .PERIOD 
in concluding ,COMMA i want to get back to the big picture and i have just two final slides to try and put it in perspective .PERIOD 
and so i just put robotic and natural cockroaches out there ,COMMA but you can fill in whatever you want .PERIOD this is not a forecast .PERIOD 
last night we gave it a few too many turns and it tried to bash the roof out also .PERIOD it's about a gram .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
and despite their ferocious appearance ,COMMA tasmanian devils are actually quite adorable little animals .PERIOD 
but inevitably ,COMMA these tumors progress towards being enormous ,COMMA ulcerating tumors like this one here .PERIOD 
they were too young to survive without their mother .PERIOD 
scientists around the world were intrigued by this cancer ,COMMA this infectious cancer ,COMMA that was spreading through the tasmanian devil population .PERIOD 
i myself had a tumor removed from my large intestine when i was only <NUM> .PERIOD 
paradoxically ,COMMA once established ,COMMA natural selection actually favors the continued growth of cancer .PERIOD 
so cancer could be thought of as a strange ,COMMA short-lived ,COMMA self-destructive life form - an evolutionary dead end .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA more genetic profiling told us that this tumor in jonas actually probably first arose from the cells of a female tasmanian devil - and jonas was clearly a male .PERIOD 
so how come a tumor that arose from the cells of another individual is growing on jonas' face ?QUESTIONMARK 
well the next breakthrough came from studying hundreds of tasmanian devil cancers from all around tasmania .PERIOD 
they tend to bite each other ,COMMA often quite ferociously and usually on the face .PERIOD 
but if this can happen in tasmanian devils ,COMMA why hasn't it happened in other animals or even humans ?QUESTIONMARK 
well the answer is ,COMMA it has .PERIOD 
she took him to the vet and the vet discovered something quite disgusting .PERIOD 
so we've seen that this can happen in animals .PERIOD 
ad he decided to put this to the test by actually deliberately inoculating people with cancer from somebody else .PERIOD 
most of the people that dr. southam injected did not go on to develop cancer from the injected cells .PERIOD 
and i think that this is something that oncologists and epidemiologists should be aware of in the future .PERIOD 
why has the record been so poor ?QUESTIONMARK 
because after years of stagnation and decline ,COMMA the mentality of politics is that it's a zero-sum game .PERIOD 
the security council typically has the responsibility for providing the peacekeepers who build the security .PERIOD 
it does increase security .PERIOD 
one is jobs .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA that is difficult .PERIOD 
so we need to encourage the growth of local firms .PERIOD 
and it's schizophrenic because in their hearts donors know that's not a realistic agenda ,COMMA and so what they also do is the total bypass :COLON just fund ngos .PERIOD 
it's to split the functions of a monopoly line ministry up into three .PERIOD 
so they wouldn't be provided thanks to the united states government and some ngo .PERIOD 
and basically ,COMMA what i'd like to tell you is that power is changing ,COMMA and there are two types of changes i want to discuss .PERIOD 
what we're going to see in the <NUM> century is asia gradually returning to being more than half of the world's population and more than half of the world's product .PERIOD 
it's not just prevailing at war ,COMMA though war still persists .PERIOD 
if we try to focus on the reality ,COMMA then what we need to focus on is what's really happening in terms of china and the united states .PERIOD 
and that the chinese won't catch up or pass the americans until somewhere in the latter part ,COMMA after <NUM> ,COMMA of this century .PERIOD 
why does it matter ?QUESTIONMARK who cares ?QUESTIONMARK 
the answer is it matters quite a lot .PERIOD 
so empowering china to deal with its own problems of carbon is good for everybody ,COMMA and it's not a zero sum ,COMMA i win ,COMMA you lose .PERIOD 
how do we define our national interests so that it's not just zero sum ,COMMA but positive sum .PERIOD 
the world has a new mania .PERIOD 
a mania for learning english .PERIOD 
t :COLON i don't want to let myself down .PERIOD 
t :COLON perfect !EXCLAMATIONMARK s :COLON perfect !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
s :COLON i want to change my life !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
so is english mania good or bad ?QUESTIONMARK 
and now english is becoming the language of problem-solving .PERIOD 
it's a true feeling .PERIOD 
why is this old table in your office ?QUESTIONMARK 
and as i grew up ,COMMA i heard so much knowledge and so many insights and so much wisdom come out around this table ,COMMA i began to call it the wisdom table .PERIOD 
and i was so shocked ,COMMA so stunned ,COMMA i got up and said ,COMMA well ,COMMA thank you ,COMMA but what do i do ?QUESTIONMARK 
and that question cleared the space .PERIOD 
this film is called world peace and other 4th grade achievements .PERIOD 
and it's a beautiful thing .PERIOD 
and i saw miss ethel j .PERIOD banks who wore pearls and high-heels to elementary school every day .PERIOD 
and i'm not even talking about you behind me ,COMMA because i've got eyes in the back of my head .PERIOD 
and really ,COMMA i feel as though ,COMMA when i see the film - i have a gesture she does ,COMMA like this - i feel like i am a continuation of her gesture .PERIOD 
and so this world peace game i'd like to tell you about .PERIOD 
i didn't want to lecture or have just book reading .PERIOD 
i offer them the job ,COMMA they can turn it down ,COMMA and then they choose their own cabinet .PERIOD 
that's not all .PERIOD 
i throw them into this complex matrix ,COMMA and they trust me because we have a deep ,COMMA rich relationship together .PERIOD 
there's oil spills ,COMMA environmental disasters ,COMMA water rights disputes ,COMMA breakaway republics ,COMMA famine ,COMMA endangered species and global warming .PERIOD 
i have no chance to make any policy whatsoever once they start playing .PERIOD 
and because i don't know ,COMMA they've got to dig up the answer .PERIOD 
my question to you is ,COMMA who's in charge of that classroom ?QUESTIONMARK 
and we were very upset .PERIOD 
i could not have designed that in teaching it .PERIOD 
it'll be more realer if she reads it .PERIOD 
we have a lot of data ,COMMA but i think sometimes we go beyond data with the real truth of what's going on .PERIOD 
and there are three seconds left on the clock .PERIOD 
i joined telco ,COMMA made tata trucks ,COMMA pretty close to pune .PERIOD 
so i took one year off ,COMMA and i went to this village science program .PERIOD 
this square might look very square and prim .PERIOD 
but give a child a triangle ,COMMA he can't do a thing to it .PERIOD 
they always make a triangular roof .PERIOD 
now this is people science .PERIOD 
the insects are eaten by the frogs ;SEMICOLON the frogs are eaten by the snakes ;SEMICOLON the snakes are eaten by the eagles .PERIOD 
and you put a little fan here .PERIOD 
and this is a hundred-year-old toy .PERIOD 
i just put this inside this .PERIOD 
the most expensive thing is the battery inside this .PERIOD 
this is an old bicycle tube ,COMMA which gives you a broad rubber band ,COMMA two safety pins .PERIOD 
it's the interaction of both these magnets which makes this motor spin .PERIOD 
there are six layers - three layers of plastic ,COMMA aluminum - which are are sealed together .PERIOD 
i'm going to keep this outside ,COMMA to blow out .PERIOD i'm going to suck in air .PERIOD 
well before i go any further ,COMMA this is something worth sharing .PERIOD 
if i crank the handle ,COMMA all the wool goes inside .PERIOD 
there are <NUM> million blind children in our country - who live in a world of darkness .PERIOD 
when first you see nehru and gandhi ,COMMA this is the nehru cap - just half a newspaper .PERIOD 
and the second night ,COMMA he would take the same cap and give it another fold .PERIOD 
and there's a third one over here .PERIOD 
firstly ,COMMA radical increases in resource efficiency .PERIOD 
and for all three of these ,COMMA i believe ,COMMA biomimicry has a lot of the solutions that we're going to need .PERIOD 
and i'm just going to talk through this animation .PERIOD 
and just as natural systems tend to increase in diversity and resilience over time ,COMMA there's a real sense with this project that the number of possibilities just continue increasing .PERIOD 
and the kind of elements i'm talking about are ,COMMA firstly ,COMMA we have a restaurant inside a productive greenhouse ,COMMA a bit like this one in amsterdam called de kas .PERIOD 
so for instance ,COMMA when julius caesar arrived in north africa ,COMMA huge areas of north africa were covered in cedar and cypress forests .PERIOD 
the converse is also true .PERIOD 
the more vegetation we lose ,COMMA the more that's likely to exacerbate climate change and lead to further desertification .PERIOD 
the way it does this is it comes out at night ,COMMA crawls to the top of a sand dune ,COMMA and because it's got a matte black shell ,COMMA is able to radiate heat out to the night sky and become slightly cooler than its surroundings .PERIOD 
and the ingenuity ,COMMA if you could call it that ,COMMA goes even further .PERIOD 
between them there's a waxy finish which repels water .PERIOD 
we're working with the guy who invented the seawater greenhouse .PERIOD 
this is a greenhouse designed for arid coastal regions ,COMMA and the way it works is that you have this whole wall of evaporator grills ,COMMA and you trickle seawater over that so that wind blows through ,COMMA it picks up a lot of moisture and is cooled in the process .PERIOD 
and what they found with the first seawater greenhouse that was built was it was producing slightly more freshwater than it needed for the plants inside .PERIOD 
and when you think about nature ,COMMA often you think about it as being all about competition .PERIOD 
you think ,COMMA what can i add to the system to create more value ?QUESTIONMARK 
and it turns out that different things crystallize out at different stages .PERIOD 
now we would be able to make use of all that waste brine .PERIOD 
we could evaporate it to enhance the restorative benefits and capture the salts ,COMMA transforming an urgent waste problem into a big opportunity .PERIOD 
far too much of the talk about the environment uses very negative language .PERIOD 
and this is an important point .PERIOD 
there are very few doctors and ,COMMA quite frankly ,COMMA these countries do not have the resources that are needed to cope with such epidemics .PERIOD 
very simple .PERIOD 
and knowing that starts to explain a lot of long-standing mysteries in science .PERIOD 
it also brings up new issues ,COMMA though ,COMMA like computational irreducibility .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA in working on this science for many years ,COMMA i kept wondering ,COMMA what will be its first killer app ?QUESTIONMARK 
let's start off with something really easy .PERIOD 
and it should be able to tell us that .PERIOD 
let's say the revenue of microsoft .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA even starting from mathematica ,COMMA this is still a huge amount of work .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA a crucial idea of wolfram alpha is that you can just ask it questions using ordinary human language ,COMMA which means that we've got to be able to take all those strange utterances that people type into the input field and understand them .PERIOD 
and i must say that i thought that step might just be plain impossible .PERIOD 
right now ,COMMA if we look at web queries ,COMMA more than <NUM> percent of them get handled successfully the first time .PERIOD 
and when one does that ,COMMA one really changes the economics of delivering computational things ,COMMA whether it's on the web or elsewhere .PERIOD 
i'll show you one example here .PERIOD 
something like rule <NUM> ,COMMA for example ,COMMA turns out to be a really good randomness generator .PERIOD 
so could that be what's going on with our whole universe ?QUESTIONMARK 
but in at least a large class of cases ,COMMA one can think of the universe as being like some kind of network ,COMMA which ,COMMA when it gets big enough ,COMMA behaves like continuous space in much the same way as having lots of molecules can behave like a continuous fluid .PERIOD 
actually ,COMMA i haven't shown these before ,COMMA but here are a few of the candidate universes that i've looked at .PERIOD 
benoit mandelbrot is in the audience .PERIOD 
we've questioned the future of capitalism .PERIOD 
and the idea is a simple ,COMMA simple idea ,COMMA which is the fact that the consumer has moved from a state of anxiety to action .PERIOD 
the consumer is empowered .PERIOD 
do you know what this was right here ?QUESTIONMARK 
and what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we are actually stepping forth and basically leveraging future education ,COMMA future children in our households .PERIOD 
however ,COMMA consumers have moved .PERIOD 
dentists report molars ,COMMA you know ,COMMA people grinding their teeth ,COMMA coming in and reporting the fact that they've had stress .PERIOD 
but seriously ,COMMA what we see happening ,COMMA and the reason i want to stress that the consumer is not in retreat ,COMMA is that this is a tremendous opportunity for the consumer who drove us into this recession to lead us right back out .PERIOD 
we see high-end haggling in fashion today .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA from a value and values standpoint ,COMMA what companies can do is connect in lots of different ways .PERIOD 
gore-tex is all about personal accountability of their management and their employees ,COMMA to the point where they really kind of shun the idea of bosses .PERIOD 
the third of the four laws of post-crisis consumerism is about durable living .PERIOD 
i was fascinated to learn that <NUM> percent of all homes in america are actually built by owners .PERIOD 
let's look at a couple of quick examples .PERIOD 
you need to harness it .PERIOD you need to give it meaning .PERIOD 
this kogi doesn't exist .PERIOD it's a moving truck .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK 
or you look at johnson & amp ;SEMICOLON johnson's momversations .PERIOD 
you see this rising force in sort of total transparency and openness that companies are starting to adopt ,COMMA all because the consumer is demanding it .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA at the same time ,COMMA this is also a tremendous opportunity .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i decided to investigate .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i'm going to challenge all of you .PERIOD 
we talk about world peace .PERIOD 
and i want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands ,COMMA great mothers ,COMMA friends ,COMMA daughters ,COMMA sons .PERIOD 
that's what i do in life - telling stories ,COMMA writing novels - and today i would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called the djinni .PERIOD 
i was born in strasbourg ,COMMA france to turkish parents .PERIOD 
in response she said ,COMMA yes ,COMMA praying is effective ,COMMA but also beware of the power of circles .PERIOD 
we all do .PERIOD 
our friends ,COMMA neighbors ,COMMA colleagues ,COMMA family - if all the people in our inner circle resemble us ,COMMA it means we are surrounded with our mirror image .PERIOD 
instead ,COMMA it generated an atmosphere in which each child was seen - not as an individual on his own ,COMMA but as the representative of something larger .PERIOD 
i came to learn that these were the three main stereotypes about my country :COLON politics ,COMMA cigarettes and the veil .PERIOD 
i lived in a very vibrant ,COMMA diverse neighborhood where i wrote several of my novels .PERIOD 
what i experienced as a child in that school in madrid is happening in the literary world today .PERIOD 
meanwhile ,COMMA the other leg draws a wide circle ,COMMA constantly moving .PERIOD 
we see them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the djinn ,COMMA who are made of smokeless fire and are the symbol of elusiveness .PERIOD 
perhaps that's not the right way to start at all .PERIOD 
you see there ,COMMA it's about <NUM> billion a year .PERIOD 
r & amp ;SEMICOLON d in total in the economy ,COMMA publicly funded ,COMMA is about <NUM> percent of gdp .PERIOD 
the first thing i want to say ,COMMA and this is straight from wonders of the solar system ,COMMA is that our exploration of the solar system and the universe has shown us that it is indescribably beautiful .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA tiny moon .PERIOD 
that's fascinating and beautiful in itself ,COMMA but we think that the mechanism for powering those fountains requires there to be lakes of liquid water beneath the surface of this moon .PERIOD 
and what's important about that is that ,COMMA on our planet ,COMMA on earth ,COMMA wherever we find liquid water ,COMMA we find life .PERIOD 
tremendous and beautiful discovery .PERIOD 
and they saw strange pictures like this .PERIOD 
it's called helios - helios from the sun .PERIOD 
that's a type ia supernova explosion .PERIOD 
it sits there about ,COMMA say ,COMMA <NUM> times the mass of the sun .PERIOD 
i think that's a remarkable demonstration of the power and beauty and universality of the laws of physics ,COMMA because we understand that process ,COMMA because we understand the structure of atoms here on earth .PERIOD 
and if i blow it up there ,COMMA you see it .PERIOD 
but it visited jupiter ,COMMA saturn ,COMMA uranus and neptune .PERIOD 
you could have made it in the <NUM> ;SEMICOLON you wouldn't have the transistor .PERIOD 
let me leave the last words to someone who's rapidly becoming a hero of mine ,COMMA humphrey davy ,COMMA who did his science at the turn of the <NUM> century .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
streets have names ;SEMICOLON blocks are just the unnamed spaces in between streets .PERIOD 
they say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA well that's block <NUM> and this is block <NUM> .PERIOD 
just look at google maps here .PERIOD there's block <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD 
you say ,COMMA ok ,COMMA but walking around the neighborhood ,COMMA i noticed that the house numbers don't go in order .PERIOD 
it's a phenomenon on the internet today called behavioral tracking ,COMMA and it is very big business .PERIOD 
our daughter then joined us at the breakfast table ,COMMA and i asked her ,COMMA is there an emphasis on music literacy in your school ?QUESTIONMARK 
i go to work ,COMMA i check email ,COMMA i log onto a few more social sites ,COMMA i blog ,COMMA i check more news reports ,COMMA i share some of those news reports ,COMMA i go look at some videos ,COMMA pretty typical day - in this case ,COMMA actually fairly pedantic - and at the end of the day ,COMMA as my day winds down ,COMMA look at my profile .PERIOD 
and i ’ d say ,COMMA well ,COMMA i ’ m walking for the environment .PERIOD 
i called my parents up .PERIOD 
and so i did .PERIOD 
it ’ s only <NUM> miles .PERIOD 
i had written the university of montana two years earlier and said i'd like to go to school there .PERIOD 
but i use that story because they really wanted to help me .PERIOD 
i had <NUM> students when i first walked into the class .PERIOD 
i could see they were looking for the schedule ,COMMA to see when they could get out .PERIOD 
they had to take that class with me .PERIOD 
and on earth day ,COMMA <NUM> - the <NUM> anniversary of earth day - that ’ s when i began to speak .PERIOD 
i got on a sailboat and i sailed down to the caribbean ,COMMA and walked through all of the islands ,COMMA and to venezuela .PERIOD 
and i got to - i start saying ,COMMA free at last - thank god almighty ,COMMA i ’ m free at last .PERIOD 
i had no idea i was going to become a u.n .PERIOD ambassador .PERIOD 
i was going to have to change .PERIOD 
i know i needed to change ,COMMA because it would be the only way that i could be here today .PERIOD 
when does learning begin ?QUESTIONMARK 
well today i want to present to you an idea that may be surprising and may even seem implausible ,COMMA but which is supported by the latest evidence from psychology and biology .PERIOD 
now i'm a science reporter .PERIOD 
i write books and magazine articles .PERIOD 
the flavors of the food a pregnant woman eats find their way into the amniotic fluid ,COMMA which is continuously swallowed by the fetus .PERIOD 
what this means is that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers about what is safe and good to eat .PERIOD 
the pregnant woman's diet and stress level in particular provide important clues to prevailing conditions like a finger lifted to the wind .PERIOD 
the hunger winter ,COMMA as it came to be known ,COMMA killed some <NUM> people and weakened thousands more .PERIOD 
learning is one of life's most essential activities ,COMMA and it begins much earlier than we ever imagined .PERIOD 
you'd still have five billion left in change ,COMMA and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA years after you remember the strategic question of whether you're flying in a <NUM> or an airbus ,COMMA you remember those words and that experience .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA it could almost be rather like that scene from the film airplane .PERIOD 
i spoke about this before ,COMMA and a brilliant person got in touch with me and said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA what can you do ?QUESTIONMARK 
one of them also being ,COMMA although logically it's quite a good idea to have a lift with no up and down button in it ,COMMA if it only serves two floors ,COMMA it's actually bloody terrifying ,COMMA okay ?QUESTIONMARK 
they said ,COMMA can we do an advertising campaign ?QUESTIONMARK 
i said ,COMMA it's really ,COMMA really easy .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA interesting that no single person does that ,COMMA or at least can admit to being so anal as to do it .PERIOD 
moving over ,COMMA we come ,COMMA of course ,COMMA to consultancy .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA tiger surely was actually obeying the accenture model .PERIOD 
that's why i call for the chief detail officer .PERIOD 
but as i was moving away from the traditional classical repertoire and trying to find new ways of musical expression ,COMMA i realized that with today's technological resources ,COMMA there's no reason to limit what can be produced at one time from a single string instrument .PERIOD 
but what actually interests me a lot more is the fact that in the tip of each controller is a relatively high-performing infrared camera .PERIOD 
and i also was taught ,COMMA coupled with that ,COMMA that it was my job - this classroom full of five and six year-old children - it was our job ,COMMA apparently ,COMMA to help .PERIOD 
this is what jesus asked of us .PERIOD 
that was news to me ,COMMA and it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in .PERIOD 
and i felt overwhelmed .PERIOD 
and i didn't know what would happen when i ran out of things to give ,COMMA especially if the problem was never going away .PERIOD 
i heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor .PERIOD 
i started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth ,COMMA because i wasn't doing more ,COMMA apparently ,COMMA to make things better .PERIOD 
it became a transaction for me ,COMMA became sort of a trade .PERIOD 
so i spent three months in kenya ,COMMA uganda and tanzania interviewing entrepreneurs that had received <NUM> dollars to start or grow a business .PERIOD 
i was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories .PERIOD 
but there were these beautiful details ,COMMA even if i talked to <NUM> goat herders in a row ,COMMA and some days that's what happened - these beautiful details of life change that were meaningful to them .PERIOD 
i never once was asked for a donation ,COMMA which had kind of been my mode ,COMMA right .PERIOD 
we sent it over to uganda .PERIOD 
when you lend them money ,COMMA and they slowly pay you back over time ,COMMA you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue .PERIOD 
so the mapping of participating in the story ,COMMA it actually flows with the up and down .PERIOD 
we make it really ,COMMA really simple for me as well as anyone else who wants to use the site .PERIOD 
but the good news is i don't think i need to stand here and convince you to care - i'm not even going to try .PERIOD 
and i'm grateful that whenever i do that ,COMMA guaranteed ,COMMA i am inspired - i am inspired by the person i am listening to .PERIOD 
what is the future of the human race ?QUESTIONMARK 
if not ,COMMA what created the universe ?QUESTIONMARK 
first ,COMMA there were the laws like maxwell's equations and general relativity that determined the evolution of the universe ,COMMA given its state over all of space at one time .PERIOD 
however ,COMMA this division into laws of evolution and initial conditions depends on time and space being separate and distinct .PERIOD 
indeed ,COMMA it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue the quest for knowledge .PERIOD 
professor hawking ,COMMA thank you for that answer .PERIOD 
i'm a geologist by training .PERIOD but i love that .PERIOD 
here we're going to see one backing into a crevice ,COMMA and watch his tentacles - he just pulls them in ,COMMA makes them look just like algae .PERIOD 
that's an amazing thing .PERIOD 
and an octopus .PERIOD ain't that amazing ?QUESTIONMARK now ,COMMA roger spooked him so he took off in a cloud of ink ,COMMA and when he lands the octopus says ,COMMA oh ,COMMA i've been seen .PERIOD 
and now he's gone ,COMMA and so am i .PERIOD thank you very much .PERIOD 
that's the lucy species ,COMMA and was found by my research team in december of <NUM> in an area called dikika .PERIOD 
it's in the northeastern part of ethiopia .PERIOD 
you don't just jump into an invitation .PERIOD 
first entertainment comes evidence from flutes that are <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
when you get there ,COMMA this is what you see ,COMMA and it's the vastness of the place which makes you feel helpless and vulnerable .PERIOD 
you find elephants ,COMMA rhinos ,COMMA monkeys ,COMMA pigs ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA another one ,COMMA that's a monkey .PERIOD that's a pig ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
here is a close-up of the fossil ,COMMA after five years of cleaning ,COMMA preparation and description ,COMMA which was very long ,COMMA and i had to expose the bones from the sandstone block i just showed you in the previous slide .PERIOD 
so then ,COMMA once you've done that ,COMMA the next stage is to know what it is .PERIOD 
you don't see that in chimpanzees ,COMMA and you don't see this very projecting canine .PERIOD 
and how old was she when she died ?QUESTIONMARK 
that's why we need care from our parents .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA by being at the cusp of our evolutionary history ,COMMA selam unites us all and gives us a unique account on what makes us human .PERIOD 
up to now ,COMMA the knowledge that we had about our ancestors came essentially from adult individuals because the fossils ,COMMA the baby fossils ,COMMA were missing .PERIOD 
imagine somebody coming from mars and his job is to report on the type of people occupying our planet earth ,COMMA and you hide all the babies ,COMMA the children ,COMMA and he goes back and reports .PERIOD 
and they were probably not aware of this future legacy ,COMMA but they did great .PERIOD 
with an average depth of the oceans of <NUM> meters ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA the high seas covers and provides nearly <NUM> percent of the habitat for life on this earth .PERIOD 
it is ,COMMA in theory ,COMMA the global commons ,COMMA belonging to us all .PERIOD 
so here is a picture of the high seas as seen from above - that area in the darker blue .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA if you want people to play by the rules ,COMMA you still need an effective system of monitoring and enforcement ,COMMA for as we've discovered ,COMMA you can trust ,COMMA but you also need to verify .PERIOD 
it's also known as the spawning ground for eels from northern european and northern american rivers that are now so dwindling in numbers that they've actually stopped showing up in stockholm ,COMMA and five showed up in the u.k. just recently .PERIOD 
it's actually a bay .PERIOD 
coming closer to here ,COMMA the costa rica dome is a recently discovered area - potentially year-round habitat for blue whales .PERIOD 
that is ,COMMA it provides a wonderful example of where you can go with a real regional initiative .PERIOD 
so what we've been suggesting is that we either need to amend the world heritage convention ,COMMA so that it can adopt and urge universal protection of these world heritage sites ,COMMA or we need to change the name and call it half-the-world heritage convention .PERIOD 
what i find so exciting is that the census of marine life has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators ;SEMICOLON it's also looked in the really unexplored mid-water column ,COMMA where creatures like this flying sea cucumber have been found .PERIOD 
and the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information to move ahead to protect some of these significant hope spots ,COMMA hotspots .PERIOD 
but not all the vessels have those to date .PERIOD 
we need to get the new paradigm of precaution and respect .PERIOD 
so here we are ,COMMA seven years ,COMMA <NUM> interviews later ,COMMA and i'm gon na tell you what really leads to success and makes ted-sters tick .PERIOD 
and the first thing i say to them is :COLON ok ,COMMA well you can't serve yourself ;SEMICOLON you got ta serve others something of value .PERIOD 
while that might be a somewhat morbid thought ,COMMA i think it has some really profound implications that are worth exploring .PERIOD 
but today we're all creating this incredibly rich digital archive that's going to live in the cloud indefinitely ,COMMA years after we're gone .PERIOD 
and what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones ,COMMA complete with photos and videos and stories that they can post after you die .PERIOD 
but what i think comes next is far more interesting .PERIOD 
now we're already starting to see some experiments here .PERIOD 
taking it a step further ,COMMA mit's media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans .PERIOD 
it's not that it's not possible to feed ,COMMA clothe and house us all and have us live decent lives .PERIOD 
and that's what will happen to us .PERIOD 
i accept where we are .PERIOD 
the future is inherently uncertain .PERIOD 
imagine our highly-tuned ,COMMA just-in-time food industry and our highly-stressed agricultural system failing and supermarket shelves emptying .PERIOD 
if we feel it now and think it through ,COMMA we will realize we have nothing to fear but fear itself .PERIOD 
we can do this .PERIOD 
i know the free market fundamentalists will tell you that more growth ,COMMA more stuff and nine billion people going shopping is the best we can do .PERIOD 
we have achieved remarkable things since working out how to grow food some <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
we've built a powerful foundation of science ,COMMA knowledge and technology - more than enough to build a society where nine billion people can lead decent ,COMMA meaningful and satisfying lives .PERIOD 
we can choose this moment of crisis to ask and answer the big questions of society's evolution - like ,COMMA what do we want to be when we grow up ,COMMA when we move past this bumbling adolescence where we think there are no limits and suffer delusions of immortality ?QUESTIONMARK 
we can choose life over fear .PERIOD 
and one more thing :COLON archie was suffering from this illness himself .PERIOD 
so the situation seemed pretty desperate .PERIOD 
he gives half of them vitamin <NUM> .PERIOD 
so cochrane then goes to the germans who are running the prison camp .PERIOD 
and he can't understand how this barbarism can be tolerated ,COMMA and he vents his frustrations .PERIOD 
so the symptoms of the complex are ,COMMA no matter how complicated the problem ,COMMA you have an absolutely overwhelming belief that you are infallibly right in your solution .PERIOD 
you could count them in five minutes .PERIOD 
what is evolution ?QUESTIONMARK 
how do you do it ?QUESTIONMARK 
it falls to the floor .PERIOD 
you make lots of money .PERIOD 
ten percent of americans don't disappear every year .PERIOD 
i sometimes wonder .PERIOD 
now i've been sort of banging on about this for the last couple of months ,COMMA and people sometimes say to me ,COMMA well tim ,COMMA it's kind of obvious .PERIOD 
and there's an authority figure in the corner behind the teacher's desk who knows all the answers .PERIOD 
when schools stop doing that all the time ,COMMA i will admit that ,COMMA yes ,COMMA it's obvious that trial and error is a good thing .PERIOD 
until then ,COMMA until then i'm going to keep banging on about trial and error and why we should abandon the god complex .PERIOD 
they had the god complex in spades .PERIOD 
and after the trial had been running for a little while ,COMMA he gathered together all his colleagues around his table ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA well ,COMMA gentlemen ,COMMA we have some preliminary results .PERIOD 
shut it down at once .PERIOD 
tumbleweed rolls through the meeting room .PERIOD 
it isn't easy .PERIOD 
so shortly after the war ,COMMA this young man ,COMMA yutaka taniyama ,COMMA developed this amazing conjecture called the taniyama-shimura conjecture .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA it turns out it's equivalent to proving fermat's last theorem .PERIOD 
you prove one ,COMMA you prove the other .PERIOD 
and the problem with leverage is it makes the u.s. financial system look like this .PERIOD 
that means every bad loan goes bad <NUM> times over .PERIOD 
and as you think about that ,COMMA you've got to wonder :COLON so what do banks have in store for you now ?QUESTIONMARK 
except we've been so busy giving away a trillion here ,COMMA a trillion there ,COMMA that we've brought that date of reckoning forward to about <NUM> .PERIOD 
we're going to start to pay them .PERIOD 
this guy runs the china investment corporation .PERIOD 
this is an actual bill .PERIOD 
if you look at the federal budget ,COMMA this is what it looks like .PERIOD 
everything else is mandated .PERIOD 
that's the short term .PERIOD that's the flame part .PERIOD 
among other things ,COMMA because startup companies are <NUM> percent of u.s. gdp investmentm and they're about <NUM> percent of output .PERIOD 
twenty-one countries came together .PERIOD dozens of teams .PERIOD 
two years ago ,COMMA you saw this creature .PERIOD 
but then if you lose one of those second set of teeth ,COMMA they don't regrow ,COMMA unless ,COMMA if you're a lawyer .PERIOD 
so there are now nine women walking around boston with re-grown bladders ,COMMA which is much more pleasant than walking around with a whole bunch of plastic bags for the rest of your life .PERIOD 
if you don't have a flat world ,COMMA that's not good ,COMMA which is why the robot's we're designing today are a little different .PERIOD 
and this stuff is moving very quickly ,COMMA and by the way ,COMMA that thing can carry about <NUM> pounds of weight .PERIOD 
and about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and i can ,COMMA they'll be able to hear maybe how bats sing ,COMMA or how whales talk ,COMMA or how dogs talk ,COMMA and other types of tonal scales .PERIOD 
this is a group in germany that's beginning to engineer eyes so that people who are blind can begin to see light and dark .PERIOD 
very primitive .PERIOD 
they'll do stuff you and i can't do .PERIOD 
and it's the <NUM> anniversary of the publication of the origin of species .PERIOD 
maybe not .PERIOD 
once upon a time ,COMMA there was a dread disease that afflicted children .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA as a consequence ,COMMA a few years later ,COMMA another scientist - perhaps maybe this scientist not quite as brilliant as the one who had preceded him ,COMMA but building on the invention of the first one - came up with a second cure .PERIOD 
and the beauty of the second cure for this disease was that it could be used on infants and one-year-olds .PERIOD 
and the government ,COMMA they heard her story and the other people ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA you're right ,COMMA we should make a law .PERIOD 
we would lose all of our market .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA many times when you try to do research on data ,COMMA it records complicated stories - it's hard to find in the data .PERIOD 
and then finally ,COMMA the last set of bars ,COMMA which are really controlling for everything you could possibly imagine about the crash ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> different characteristics of the crash .PERIOD 
and the other thing you might argue is ,COMMA well ,COMMA car seats have got a lot better over time .PERIOD 
so they just have these bench seats ,COMMA and they strap the car seat and the seatbelt onto it .PERIOD 
anyway ,COMMA it turns out that those two crashes ,COMMA that actually the three-year-old did slightly worse .PERIOD so ,COMMA he gets about a <NUM> out of - you know ,COMMA on this range - relative to a <NUM> and something .PERIOD 
and this seatbelt would have passed with flying colors into being approved as a car seat .PERIOD 
it's in <NUM> days ,COMMA all this stuff has come .PERIOD 
there's two million emails per second .PERIOD 
it's just a huge machine ,COMMA and it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet .PERIOD 
and in some ways ,COMMA it's sort of back to the kind of old idea of centralized computing .PERIOD 
and i am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the web .PERIOD 
they're going to talk to the machine .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA with rfids and other things - whatever technology it is ,COMMA it doesn't really matter .PERIOD the point is that everything will have embedded in it some sensor connecting it to the machine ,COMMA and so we have ,COMMA basically ,COMMA an internet of things .PERIOD 
but in fact ,COMMA what the new economy really is is the marriage of those two ,COMMA where we embed the information ,COMMA and the digital nature of things into the material world .PERIOD 
attention is the currency .PERIOD 
and i'm saying ,COMMA humans are now going to be the extended senses of the machine ,COMMA in a certain sense .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the second thing that i want to talk about was this idea of restructuring ,COMMA that what the web is doing is restructuring .PERIOD 
and what you had to do was - if you wanted to participate in this ,COMMA you had to share packets of information .PERIOD 
it wasn't like a telephone system where you had control of a line :COLON you had to share packets .PERIOD 
the second stage that we're in now is the idea of linking pages .PERIOD 
you couldn't deny - if someone wanted to link to you ,COMMA you couldn't stop them .PERIOD you had to participate in this idea of opening up your pages to be linked by anybody .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA the last thing i want to talk about is this idea that we're going to be codependent .PERIOD 
and what is happening with this is some kind of ai ,COMMA but it's not the ai in conscious ai ,COMMA as being an expert ,COMMA larry page told me that that's what they're trying to do ,COMMA and that's what they're trying to do .PERIOD 
but it'll anticipate what we're doing ,COMMA in a good sense .PERIOD 
and all these devices will be portals into that .PERIOD 
it was on jonestown .PERIOD 
the top picture is a group of moonies that have been blessed by their messiah .PERIOD 
and so what is this ?QUESTIONMARK how does this work ?QUESTIONMARK 
these easy ideas to complex questions are very appealing when you are emotionally vulnerable .PERIOD 
we're beginning to look inside the brain .PERIOD 
and so if you looked at my brain ,COMMA or any brain that's infected with a viral memetic infection like this ,COMMA and compared it to anyone in this room ,COMMA or anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular basis ,COMMA i am convinced it would look very ,COMMA very different .PERIOD 
because i have to say ,COMMA for my whole career ,COMMA if there's anything that's been consistent ,COMMA it's been that you can't do it .PERIOD 
it's calvino's idea of the quickest way between two points is the circuitous line ,COMMA not the straight line .PERIOD 
we make physical things ,COMMA buildings that become a part in an accretional process ;SEMICOLON they make cities .PERIOD 
and i've had for <NUM> years an interest in a series of complexities where a series of forces are brought to bear ,COMMA and to understand the nature of the final result of that ,COMMA representing the building itself .PERIOD 
this is a project that we just finished in penang for a very ,COMMA very large city project that came directly out of this process ,COMMA which is the result of the multiplicity of forces that produce it .PERIOD 
and an image which may be closest talks about the use of light as a medium ,COMMA that light becomes literally a building material .PERIOD 
this will be the first building in the united states that took - well ,COMMA i can't say it took the air conditioning out .PERIOD it's a hybrid .PERIOD 
and i understood that building really could be the augmentation of the earth's surface ,COMMA and it completely shifted the notion of building ground in the most basic sense .PERIOD 
what i'm interested in are how these ideas participate in the educational process of young people .PERIOD 
one enters the building as it lifts off the ground ,COMMA and it becomes part of the idea .PERIOD 
and then the skin - the edges of this - all promote the dynamic ,COMMA the movement of the building as a series of seismic shifts ,COMMA geologic shifts .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK 
and finally ,COMMA one of the most interesting projects - it's a courthouse .PERIOD 
here's a piano nobile ,COMMA which is a device used in the renaissance .PERIOD 
it changed the way our history developed .PERIOD 
it is made for a diet which is soft ,COMMA mushy ,COMMA which is reduced in fibers ,COMMA which is very easily chewable and digestible .PERIOD 
sounds like fast food ,COMMA doesn't it .PERIOD 
it's technology .PERIOD 
so this ingenuity of our ancestors ,COMMA to invent this most marvelous technology .PERIOD 
we populated all the ecologies .PERIOD 
it keeps also your brain working .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA it's not obvious to be honest .PERIOD 
now having a large brain ,COMMA as you know ,COMMA is a big advantage ,COMMA because you can actually influence your environment .PERIOD 
you know we have up to five tastes ,COMMA three of them sustain us .PERIOD 
so we can make mixtures of all this kind of thing because we know that ,COMMA in cooking ,COMMA we can transform it to the form .PERIOD 
so satisfaction was a very important part .PERIOD 
if you get a stomach ache ,COMMA if you get a little bit bloated ,COMMA was not the right food ,COMMA was not the right cooking manipulation or maybe other things went wrong .PERIOD 
but what it means to have a brain there is that ,COMMA not only the big brain has to talk with the food ,COMMA the food has to talk with the brain ,COMMA because we have to learn actually how to talk to the brains .PERIOD 
this is the layer which actually touches the food you are swallowing and you digest ,COMMA which is actually the lumen .PERIOD 
what it means is that we have a layered control system .PERIOD 
so if you override the hunger signal ,COMMA you can have a disorder ,COMMA which is called anorexia .PERIOD 
this is fat digestion .PERIOD 
actually ,COMMA what happens is that a very intricate structure appears .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA culture was born of the imagination ,COMMA and the imagination - the imagination as we know it - came into being when our species descended from our progenitor ,COMMA homo erectus ,COMMA and ,COMMA infused with consciousness ,COMMA began a journey that would carry it to every corner of the habitable world .PERIOD 
and the way clayton put it was this way .PERIOD 
i recently sailed on the hokulea ,COMMA named after the sacred star of hawaii ,COMMA throughout the south pacific to make a film about the navigators .PERIOD 
i spent <NUM> years living amongst the people of chinchero and i always heard about an event that i always wanted to participate in .PERIOD 
and then you do the ritual dances that empower the crosses .PERIOD 
these ,COMMA of course ,COMMA are the descendants of the ancient tairona civilization .PERIOD 
there are four societies :COLON the kogi ,COMMA the wiwa ,COMMA the kankwano and the arhuacos .PERIOD 
i traveled with the arhuacos ,COMMA and the wonderful thing about this story was that this man ,COMMA danilo villafane - if we just jump back here for a second .PERIOD 
we traveled high into the paramo ,COMMA and as we crested the hills ,COMMA we realized that the men were interpreting every single bump on the landscape in terms of their own intense religiosity .PERIOD 
and we ran into a farc patrol at dawn ,COMMA so it was quite harrowing .PERIOD 
they dismiss the rest of us who have ruined the world as the younger brothers .PERIOD they cannot understand why it is that we do what we do to the earth .PERIOD 
and when asked that question ,COMMA they respond with <NUM> different voices .PERIOD 
they are unique answers to that fundamental question :COLON what does it mean to be human and alive ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA you're living through a time when virtually half of humanity's intellectual ,COMMA social and spiritual legacy is being allowed to slip away .PERIOD 
this does not have to happen .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i'd like to spend a few minutes with you folks today imagining what our planet might look like in a thousand years .PERIOD 
this is crazy .PERIOD 
if you're in northern europe or north america ,COMMA you can use things like buckwheat husks or oat hulls .PERIOD 
because the manufacturing process is our organism .PERIOD 
they're not going to clog up earth's ecosystems .PERIOD they work great .PERIOD 
my brief ,COMMA as you've just heard ,COMMA is to tell you about statistics - and ,COMMA to be more precise ,COMMA to tell you some exciting things about statistics .PERIOD 
don't tell her i said that .PERIOD 
she paused and said ,COMMA he models things .PERIOD 
the next time ,COMMA after the <NUM> toss .PERIOD 
that's what i want this side to think about .PERIOD 
either they're the same ,COMMA or this one's bigger than this one ,COMMA or this one's bigger than that one .PERIOD 
who thinks that c is true - that ,COMMA on average ,COMMA it'll take less time to see head-tail-head than head-tail-tail ?QUESTIONMARK 
the champagne's on ice just next to you ;SEMICOLON you've got the glasses chilled to celebrate .PERIOD 
and if it comes down a head ,COMMA that's great .PERIOD 
it's the same for the first two parts of the sequence .PERIOD 
if it's a head you're disappointed ,COMMA but you're still a third of the way to your pattern again .PERIOD 
this is my little diversion into my real passion ,COMMA which is genetics .PERIOD 
when you toss a coin ,COMMA you get a sequence of heads and tails .PERIOD 
and they're an enormously useful tool in modern molecular biology .PERIOD 
but it turns out that unlocking the secrets in the information generated by modern experimental technologies ,COMMA a key part of that has to do with fairly sophisticated - you'll be relieved to know that i do something useful in my day job ,COMMA rather more sophisticated than the head-tail-head story - but quite sophisticated computer modelings and mathematical modelings and modern statistical techniques .PERIOD 
it's not the answer ,COMMA and it's not because it's only part of the story .PERIOD 
here's a little caricature of a million individuals .PERIOD 
those of you in britain will know about what's become rather a celebrated case of a woman called sally clark ,COMMA who had two babies who died suddenly .PERIOD 
and to argue ,COMMA then ,COMMA that the chance of a second death is as if you didn't know that information is really silly .PERIOD 
one of them is that sally clark was innocent - which is ,COMMA a priori ,COMMA overwhelmingly likely - most mothers don't kill their children .PERIOD 
so just to conclude - what are the take-home messages from this ?QUESTIONMARK 
we are not good at reasoning with uncertainty .PERIOD 
all of quality control ,COMMA which has had a major impact on industrial processing ,COMMA is underpinned by statistics .PERIOD 
this is a world-changing invention .PERIOD 
well it turns out that the main causes are faulty and misused appliances and electrical wiring .PERIOD 
hmmm .PERIOD 
so far we've applied for <NUM> patent claims .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA to conclude ,COMMA intelligent power can ,COMMA globally ,COMMA save thousands of lives ,COMMA prevent tens of thousands of injuries ,COMMA and eliminate tens of billions of dollars in property damage every single year ,COMMA while significantly reducing global energy consumption .PERIOD 
in the spirit of this year's ted conference ,COMMA we think this is a powerful ,COMMA world-changing invention .PERIOD 
and that's what i'd like to talk to you a little bit about today .PERIOD 
it's acoustic vibrations in the air ,COMMA little waves of energy in the air that tickle our eardrum .PERIOD 
and it's at the hair cell level that they do this .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA nothing even actually comes close to our ability to restore hearing .PERIOD 
and as a physician and a surgeon ,COMMA i can confidently tell my patients that if you had to pick a sense to lose ,COMMA we are the furthest along medically and surgically with hearing .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA play that video please .PERIOD 
i'm saying that they're going to face obstacles that most people who have normal hearing will not have to face .PERIOD 
now hearing loss and the treatment for hearing loss has really evolved in the past <NUM> years .PERIOD 
i mean literally ,COMMA they used to do things like stick ear-shaped objects onto your ears and stick funnels in .PERIOD 
language is very different .PERIOD language is very precise .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA the whole reason we use it is because it has semantic-specificity .PERIOD 
but it certainly wasn't the way the music was intended .PERIOD 
what that suggests is that ,COMMA even in the case of hearing loss ,COMMA the capacity for music remains .PERIOD 
and here's a video of joseph .PERIOD 
joseph :COLON i was born in <NUM> .PERIOD 
when i was <NUM> years old ,COMMA i was one of the first few people in singapore who underwent cochlear implantation .PERIOD 
and this is really unheard of stuff ,COMMA and this is all because of this technology .PERIOD 
you don't actually have to hear it .PERIOD 
i know he doesn't hear well ,COMMA because i've heard him do karaoke .PERIOD 
and so this idea has a lot of traction with us .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA i'm here to tell you ,COMMA you don't need a computer to actually have a spell .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA what you can do at the molecular level is that if you encode information - you encode a spell or program as molecules - then physics can actually directly interpret that information and run a program .PERIOD that's what happens in proteins .PERIOD 
when this amino acid sequence gets pronounced as atoms ,COMMA these little letters are sticky for each other .PERIOD 
i mix them together ,COMMA add a little bit of salt water ,COMMA and then add this long strand i was telling you about ,COMMA that i've stolen from a virus .PERIOD and then what happens is ,COMMA you heat this whole thing up to about boiling .PERIOD you cool it down to room temperature ,COMMA and as you do ,COMMA what happens is those short strands ,COMMA they do the following thing :COLON each one of them binds that long strand in one place ,COMMA and then has a second half that binds that long strand in a distant place ,COMMA and brings those two parts of the long strand close together so that they stick together .PERIOD 
you can make a molecule that looks like this ,COMMA and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA he likes to hang out with his buddies ,COMMA right .PERIOD 
so that's dna origami .PERIOD that's one way .PERIOD there are many ways of casting molecular spells using dna .PERIOD 
i did not choose to take up the pen ,COMMA the brush ,COMMA the camera .PERIOD

or is there something else ?QUESTIONMARK 
the armed forces implement the state monopoly on violence .PERIOD 
my soldiers use the gun as an instrument of peace .PERIOD 
and that is why - and in the netherlands ,COMMA we are very unique in that - that is why the dutch constitution states that one of the main tasks of the armed forces is to uphold and promote the international rule of law .PERIOD 
and i hope that one day armies can be disbanded and humans will find a way of living together without violence and oppression .PERIOD 
i hope you will support our soldiers when they are out there ,COMMA when they come home and when they are injured and need our care .PERIOD 
you're climbing on little dimples and nubbins in the rock .PERIOD 
women are much more in balance because they don't have that idea that they're going to be able to do <NUM> pull-ups .PERIOD 
they think about how to get the weight over their feet because it's sort of natural - they carry you all day long .PERIOD 
it took us <NUM> years to sequence hiv - we sequenced sars in <NUM> days .PERIOD 
if you put different communication technologies on this logarithmic graph ,COMMA television ,COMMA radio ,COMMA telephone were adopted in decades .PERIOD 
now by the way ,COMMA if you look at this on a linear graph ,COMMA it looks like everything has just happened ,COMMA but some observer says ,COMMA well ,COMMA kurzweil just put points on this graph that fall on that straight line .PERIOD 
and again ,COMMA it forms the same straight line .PERIOD you have a little bit of thickening in the line because people do have disagreements ,COMMA what the key points are ,COMMA there's differences of opinion when agriculture started ,COMMA or how long the cambrian explosion took .PERIOD 
it took us three years to double our price performance of computing in <NUM> ,COMMA two years in the middle ;SEMICOLON we're now doubling it every one year .PERIOD 
supercomputers - same thing .PERIOD 
you would think it would be a very erratic process ,COMMA and you have a very smooth outcome of this chaotic process .PERIOD 
as we make them smaller and less expensive ,COMMA the electrons have less distance to travel .PERIOD 
and economists have actually started worrying about that .PERIOD 
this is due to greater productivity ,COMMA but the economist says ,COMMA but there's no way you're going to be able to keep up with that .PERIOD 
these were evolved in very different times - we'd like to actually change those programs .PERIOD 
we'd like to actually turn that program off .PERIOD 
four or five pharmaceutical companies have noticed this ,COMMA felt that would be interesting drug for the human market ,COMMA and that's just one of the <NUM> genes that affect our biochemistry .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA we can inhibit genes now with rna interference .PERIOD 
it's now under a <NUM> of a cent .PERIOD 
once we understand its principles of operation ,COMMA and the pace with which we are reverse-engineering biology is accelerating ,COMMA we can actually design these things to be thousands of times more capable .PERIOD 
where will we get the software ?QUESTIONMARK 
wall street noticed that this was a revolutionary technology ,COMMA which it was ,COMMA but then six months later ,COMMA when it hadn't revolutionized all business models ,COMMA they figured ,COMMA well ,COMMA that was wrong ,COMMA and then we had this bust .PERIOD 
images will be written directly to our retina ,COMMA providing full-immersion virtual reality ,COMMA augmented real reality .PERIOD we'll be interacting with virtual personalities .PERIOD 
you can go there with other people ,COMMA have any kind of experience with anyone involving all of the senses .PERIOD 
but most importantly ,COMMA it'll be a tremendous expansion of human intelligence through this direct merger with our technology ,COMMA which in some sense we're doing already .PERIOD 
it's just like this one ,COMMA completely worthless ,COMMA in which it allegedly worked by electrostatic magnetic ion attraction ,COMMA which translates to pseudoscientific baloney - would be the nice word - in which you string together a bunch of words that sound good ,COMMA but it does absolutely nothing .PERIOD 
in this case ,COMMA at trespass points ,COMMA allowing people to go through because your little tracker device said they were okay ,COMMA actually cost lives .PERIOD 
and in fact ,COMMA i think my thesis here is that belief is the natural state of things .PERIOD 
and that's called superstition ,COMMA and that ,COMMA i'm afraid ,COMMA we will always have with us .PERIOD 
you are a hominid three million years ago walking on the plains of africa .PERIOD

because the lights on here .PERIOD 
so what you see in this particular ambiguous figure is ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the dolphins ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
that's a dolphin tail there ,COMMA guys .PERIOD 
so you recognize obama immediately .PERIOD 
and this is also ,COMMA i think ,COMMA the basis of conspiracy theories .PERIOD 
explains a lot ,COMMA maybe .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA that's a whole other lecture .PERIOD 
we know that if you stimulate the temporal lobe ,COMMA you can produce a feeling of out-of-body experiences ,COMMA near-death experiences ,COMMA which you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe there .PERIOD 
and you get a sense of out-of-body experience .PERIOD 
it ties together all this into the power of expectation and the power of belief .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA now i'm going to ask you to pucker up .PERIOD 
pucker up big and lean in just a little bit ,COMMA okay ?QUESTIONMARK

witness .PERIOD 
there could be a new movement growing up ,COMMA rising from the ground ,COMMA reaching for the light ,COMMA and growing strong ,COMMA just like a tree .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD 
so in that <NUM> minutes ,COMMA or <NUM> minutes ,COMMA or five minutes ,COMMA you have to convey a whole bunch of different characteristics .PERIOD 
next up is knowledge .PERIOD 
you walk in the door .PERIOD so the first thing you've got to do - the overall ,COMMA you know ,COMMA arc of your presentation - it's got to start like a rocket .PERIOD 
and everything has got to be reinforcing this .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA so how do you do that ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA first of all ,COMMA logical progression .PERIOD 
you've also got to let me know that there are touchstones .PERIOD 
you want to tie in to the rest of the world out there .PERIOD 
so this all feeds in together .PERIOD 
you want absolute - this is the zen of presentation ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
so with that said ,COMMA we only have a very ,COMMA very short time .PERIOD 
you do that ,COMMA you give me your quick 15-second or 30-second intro ,COMMA grab my attention .PERIOD 
we build widgets for the x ,COMMA y ,COMMA z market .PERIOD 
if it's a website ,COMMA show me a screenshot of your website .PERIOD 
five is a bit much .PERIOD probably four is rational .PERIOD 
and i look at the logo - okay ,COMMA good .PERIOD 
powerpoint has this built into every copy of powerpoint that's shipped .PERIOD

and that is how to pitch to a vc .PERIOD 
i'm here today to start a revolution .PERIOD 
now before you get up in arms ,COMMA or you break into song ,COMMA or you pick a favorite color ,COMMA i want to define what i mean by revolution .PERIOD 
we're last place in health care ,COMMA and that's important for a sense of well-being .PERIOD 
that's social .PERIOD let's look at education .PERIOD 
because it's shown the way we apply ,COMMA generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context ,COMMA which told us what in communism ?QUESTIONMARK

kittens play .PERIOD we all know kittens play .PERIOD 
and it's not just kids ,COMMA it's adults too .PERIOD 
these guys are facts .PERIOD 
the opposite of play is not work .PERIOD

you know ,COMMA the professional athlete that loves skiing ,COMMA he's serious about it ,COMMA but he loves it .PERIOD 
a doctor might be serious ,COMMA but laughter's still a great medicine .PERIOD 
you guys have to ,COMMA and if you're not feeling it ,COMMA your colleagues ,COMMA your employees ,COMMA aren't going to feel it .PERIOD

let them take long lunches .PERIOD

what we need is a players' uprising .PERIOD 
what we need is a players' uprising .PERIOD 
and i am illustrating still .PERIOD 
which ,COMMA of course ,COMMA i am not agreeing with because ,COMMA although i am <NUM> ,COMMA i am not still working .PERIOD 
i still have - or did i use the word still ?QUESTIONMARK i didn't mean that .PERIOD 
these were just some of the things i've made .PERIOD 
these are tiles .PERIOD the word ,COMMA playful is a necessary aspect of our work because ,COMMA actually ,COMMA one of our problems is that we have to make ,COMMA produce ,COMMA lovely things throughout all of life ,COMMA and this for me is now <NUM> years .PERIOD 
so how can you ,COMMA without drying up ,COMMA make things with the same pleasure ,COMMA as a gift to others ,COMMA for so long ?QUESTIONMARK 
i started as an apprentice to a hungarian craftsman ,COMMA and this taught me what the guild system was in middle ages .PERIOD 
we mashed the clay with our feet when it came from the hillside .PERIOD 
and finally ,COMMA i had received a document that i had accomplished my apprenticeship successfully ,COMMA that i had behaved morally ,COMMA and this document was given to me by the guild of roof-coverers ,COMMA rail-diggers ,COMMA oven-setters ,COMMA chimney sweeps and potters .PERIOD 
i also got at the time a workbook which explained my rights and my working conditions ,COMMA and i still have that workbook .PERIOD 
my mother thought that this was not very proper ,COMMA so she sat with us to add propriety to this activity .PERIOD 
however ,COMMA the director ,COMMA the chemist ,COMMA model maker - everybody - concerned himself much more with the art department - that means ,COMMA with my work - than making toilets ,COMMA so finally they got a letter from the center ,COMMA from the bank who owned the factory ,COMMA saying ,COMMA make toilet-setting behind the art department ,COMMA and that was my end .PERIOD 
so i will try speed it up a little moderator :COLON eva ,COMMA we have about five minutes .PERIOD 
the accusation was that i had successfully prepared an attentat on stalin's life .PERIOD 
but since i survived and i'm here ,COMMA and since this is the end of the five minutes ,COMMA i will - moderator :COLON tell me when your last trip to russia was .PERIOD 
oh ,COMMA this summer ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA the lomonosov factory was bought by an american company ,COMMA invited me .PERIOD 
that's my camera lens .PERIOD the first one - the one i shot my bob dylan film with <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
i called my sister .PERIOD i called my neighbors .PERIOD i said ,COMMA come dig .PERIOD 
that's my sister .PERIOD she took care of pictures ,COMMA because i was a big collector of snapshot photography that i believed said a lot .PERIOD 
she's still there .PERIOD she's there this morning ,COMMA actually .PERIOD 
and we went into parenting expecting our lives to look like this .PERIOD 
and it was also ,COMMA of course ,COMMA surreal .PERIOD 
you're either in love ,COMMA or you're not in love .PERIOD 
i enjoyed being pregnant .PERIOD i loved it .PERIOD 
of those ,COMMA <NUM> percent are most lonely when their kids are zero to five - probably really zero to two .PERIOD 
in the process of preparing this ,COMMA we looked at how some other cultures around the world deal with this period of time ,COMMA because here in the western world ,COMMA less than <NUM> percent of us live near our family members ,COMMA which i think is part of why this is such a tough period .PERIOD 
the party line is that every single aspect of my life has just gotten dramatically better ever since i participated in the miracle that is childbirth and family .PERIOD 
as you get older ,COMMA you become more stable .PERIOD 
you start to realize that hey ,COMMA i could go to this live music event and have an utterly transforming experience that will cover my entire body with goosebumps ,COMMA but it's more likely that i'll feel claustrophobic and i won't be able to get a beer .PERIOD 
so your average happiness goes up ,COMMA but you lose those transcendent moments .PERIOD 
but you realize you resubmit yourself to losing control in a really wonderful way ,COMMA which we think provides a lot of meaning to our lives and is quite gratifying .PERIOD 
we trade the sort of security and safety of a certain level of contentment for these transcendent moments .PERIOD 
so where does that leave the two of us as a family with our three little boys in the thick of all this ?QUESTIONMARK 
there's another factor in our case .PERIOD 
and we had reservations about this on the front end .PERIOD 
get out of the airplane ,COMMA it turns out you're trekking in nepal .PERIOD 
we crave to be in the room with the musician the day it was recorded ,COMMA the day it was played .PERIOD 
and we go to live concerts ,COMMA and we get that as much as we can .PERIOD 
and yamaha makes an incredible thing called the disklavier pro that looks like a nice grand piano there .PERIOD 
he just got tired of being in front of an audience ,COMMA and felt like - a performing monkey was ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA his term .PERIOD 
his maybe most famous recording was something called the goldberg variations .PERIOD 
he wrote some early pieces ,COMMA but late in his life ,COMMA in his mature period ,COMMA he said ,COMMA here's a theme - <NUM> variations .PERIOD 
and gould recorded it in two major recordings that you may know about ,COMMA one in mono ,COMMA and one in stereo .PERIOD 
what i'd like you to hear live is the <NUM> version ,COMMA and we'll play the first couple pieces of it .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA in the video world ,COMMA we've been able to invent ,COMMA in our lifetimes ,COMMA natural behavior .PERIOD 
and when you put on headphones ,COMMA and you listen to this ,COMMA you're inside of glenn gould's body .PERIOD 
your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
you want to hear it in different rooms and whatever .PERIOD 
we made a new recording of him playing in the shrine auditorium in september .PERIOD 
and fortunately ,COMMA it's right in here .PERIOD 
i want to start just by saying a bit about where i'm coming from .PERIOD 
i trained briefly as a buddhist monk under this guy .PERIOD 
and although that was great for the music business at the time ,COMMA it wasn't much good for anything else .PERIOD 
unprecedented wealth and prosperity ,COMMA but that growth hasn't always delivered what we needed .PERIOD 
rates of depression carried on up ,COMMA right across the western world .PERIOD 
they bring ideas from the margins into the mainstream .PERIOD 
ronald reagan ,COMMA again ,COMMA said the two funniest sentences in the english language are ,COMMA i'm from the government .PERIOD and i'm here to help .PERIOD 
and i think more and more people are also asking :COLON why boost consumption ,COMMA rather than change what we consume ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's not that our scientists are necessarily much smarter than they were a hundred years ago ,COMMA maybe they are ,COMMA but they have a hell of a lot more backing than they ever did .PERIOD 
and he believed we live with others ,COMMA we share the world with others and therefore our innovation must be done with others too ,COMMA not doing things at people ,COMMA for them ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD 
others are much more pragmatic :COLON health coaches ,COMMA learning mentors ,COMMA job clubs .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the idea that all of this represents ,COMMA i think ,COMMA is rapidly becoming a common sense and part of how we respond to the crisis ,COMMA recognizing the need to invest in innovation for social progress as well as technological progress .PERIOD 
there were big health innovation funds launched earlier this year in this country ,COMMA as well as a public service innovation lab .PERIOD 
and if ,COMMA a generation or two ago ,COMMA the big challenges were ones like getting a man on the moon ,COMMA perhaps the challenges we need to set ourselves now are ones like eliminating child malnutrition ,COMMA stopping trafficking ,COMMA or one ,COMMA i think closer to home for america or europe ,COMMA why don't we set ourselves the goal of achieving a billion extra years of life for today's citizens .PERIOD 
now those are all goals which could be achieved within a decade ,COMMA but only with radical and systematic experiment ,COMMA not just with technologies ,COMMA but also with lifestyles and culture and policies and institutions too .PERIOD 
history was over and society would inevitably have to take second place to economy .PERIOD 
just as today ,COMMA the enthusiasts of unrestrained capitalism say it's rooted in human nature ,COMMA only now it's individualism ,COMMA inquisitiveness ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD 
you think i've lost my way ,COMMA and somebody's going to come on the stage in a minute and guide me gently back to my seat .PERIOD 
i want to tell you about my friend who was teaching english to adults in abu dhabi .PERIOD 
and one fine day ,COMMA she decided to take them into the garden to teach them some nature vocabulary .PERIOD 
a language dies every <NUM> days .PERIOD 
that is a little bit too early .PERIOD 
we were brought to teach english because the government wanted to modernize the country and to empower the citizens through education .PERIOD 
but if you're not a native speaker ,COMMA you have to pass a test .PERIOD 
do we really want to end up with <NUM> languages and the main one being english ,COMMA or chinese ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i want to remind you that the giants upon whose shoulders today's intelligentsia stand did not have to have english ,COMMA they didn't have to pass an english test .PERIOD 
let me tell you a story about two scientists ,COMMA two english scientists .PERIOD 
so he invented a cost-free solar lamp .PERIOD 
when he received his award ,COMMA he said these lovely words :COLON the children can lead africa from what it is today ,COMMA a dark continent ,COMMA to a light continent .PERIOD 
i am known best for human-powered flight ,COMMA but that was just one thing that got me going in the sort of things that i'm working in now .PERIOD 
and we thought a solar-powered plane wouldn't really make sense ,COMMA but you could do it and it would get a lot of publicity for solar power and maybe help that field .PERIOD 
you don't need to dig down for these chemicals ,COMMA and we can do things much more efficiently .PERIOD 
so this just summarizes it .PERIOD over billions of years ,COMMA on a unique sphere ,COMMA chance has painted a thin covering of life - complex and probable ,COMMA wonderful and fragile .PERIOD 
suddenly ,COMMA we humans ,COMMA a recently arrived species ,COMMA no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature ,COMMA have grown in population ,COMMA technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power .PERIOD we ,COMMA now ,COMMA wield the paintbrush .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA and let's have the next .PERIOD 
and then also ,COMMA like it said in the video ,COMMA you can turn it left or right just by putting the lift under one wing or another .PERIOD 
and that's it ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA just a few inventions .PERIOD 
most of the talks that you've heard in the last several fabulous days have been from people who have the characteristic that they have thought about something ,COMMA they are experts ,COMMA they know what's going on .PERIOD 
all of you know about the topic that i'm supposed to talk about .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA it enables you to drink coffee .PERIOD 
and the other ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is a birth control pill ,COMMA which ,COMMA in a very simple way ,COMMA fundamentally changed the structure of society by changing the role of women in it by providing to them the opportunity to make reproductive choices .PERIOD 
it's like ,COMMA what is simplicity ?QUESTIONMARK 
what is the state of science ?QUESTIONMARK 
and ,COMMA interestingly ,COMMA complexity is very highly evolved .PERIOD 
one of the things i want to do is to help you with a very important task - which you may not know that you have very often - which is to understand how to sit next to a physicist at a dinner party and have a conversation .PERIOD 
and the words that i would like you to focus on are complexity and emergence ,COMMA because these will enable you to start the conversation and then daydream about other things .PERIOD 
and that's complexity .PERIOD 
all right ,COMMA so let me give you an example of simplicity of a particular kind .PERIOD 
the question is :COLON why is binary simpler than arabic ?QUESTIONMARK 
and this is a map of bitflows across the continent .PERIOD 
that is ,COMMA you can stack them .PERIOD 
and you put a drop ,COMMA in this case ,COMMA of urine at the bottom .PERIOD 
it turns colors .PERIOD in this particular case ,COMMA you're reading kidney function .PERIOD 
if you take too much out of something that's simple ,COMMA you lose function .PERIOD 
so you can't make it too simple .PERIOD 
and the second is a design issue ,COMMA and it's not directly relevant ,COMMA but it's a nice statement .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what i think one can begin to do with this kind of cut at the word simplicity ,COMMA which doesn't cover brancusi ,COMMA it doesn't answer the question of why mondrian is better or worse or simpler or less simpler than van gogh ,COMMA and certainly doesn't address the question of whether mozart is simpler than bach .PERIOD 
you've got a company set up to .PERIOD 
i want to open by quoting einstein's wonderful statement ,COMMA just so people will feel at ease that the great scientist of the <NUM> century also agrees with us ,COMMA and also calls us to this action .PERIOD 
i know the next buddha will come a few thousand years from now ,COMMA but exists currently in a certain heaven - that's maitreya - so ,COMMA i'm going to go on a retreat and i'm going to meditate and pray until the buddha maitreya reveals himself to me ,COMMA and gives me a teaching or something to revive the practice of compassion in the world today .PERIOD 
and the man said ,COMMA really ?QUESTIONMARK and he showed him a dish full of needles .PERIOD 
so he said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA i get the point .PERIOD 
he went back to his cave .PERIOD he meditated again .PERIOD 
another three years ,COMMA no vision .PERIOD he leaves again .PERIOD 
so he thought ,COMMA i will take the maggots and put them on this piece of flesh ,COMMA then clean the dog's wounds ,COMMA and then i'll figure out what to do with the maggots .PERIOD 
so he starts to do that .PERIOD he can't grab the maggots .PERIOD 
he jumps back and there ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is the future buddha maitreya in a beautiful vision - rainbow lights ,COMMA golden ,COMMA jeweled ,COMMA a plasma body ,COMMA an exquisite mystic vision - that he sees .PERIOD 
so as he comes up from his first bow he says ,COMMA my lord ,COMMA i'm so happy to see you ,COMMA but where have you been for <NUM> years ?QUESTIONMARK 
and maitreya says ,COMMA i was with you .PERIOD who do you think was making needles and making nests and dripping on rocks for you ,COMMA mister dense ?QUESTIONMARK 
looking for the buddha in person ,COMMA he said .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA naturally ,COMMA they chased him out of town .PERIOD 
you gave me that expression ;SEMICOLON the eternal mama ,COMMA you said .PERIOD that's wonderful .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA they first create this foundation of equality .PERIOD 
and we don't hate anyone ,COMMA therefore .PERIOD so we equalize .PERIOD that's very important .PERIOD 
and this is the way you do it .PERIOD you take any being who looks weird to you ,COMMA and you see how they could be familiar to you .PERIOD 
you reduce the feeling of otherness about beings .PERIOD 
and then you connect that with your feeling that everyone has that motherly possibility .PERIOD 
and they ,COMMA then ,COMMA never get any positive feedback .PERIOD 
compassion makes you happy .PERIOD 
the first person who is happy when you get great compassion is yourself ,COMMA even if you haven't done anything yet for anybody else .PERIOD 
because traditional economic theory would say ,COMMA well ,COMMA the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation that had a big r & amp ;SEMICOLON d lab where they were thinking up new projects ,COMMA and it came out of there .PERIOD it didn't come from there .PERIOD 
the ideas are coming back from the consumers ,COMMA and they're often ahead of the producers .PERIOD 
the very first landline telephones ,COMMA the inventors thought that they would be used for people to listen in to live performances from west end theaters .PERIOD 
more and more ,COMMA the inventors of things will not be able to say that in advance .PERIOD 
the second reason why users are more and more important is that they are the source of big ,COMMA disruptive innovations .PERIOD 
take astronomy as an example ,COMMA which yochai has already mentioned .PERIOD 
what does this mean ,COMMA then ,COMMA for our organizational landscape ?QUESTIONMARK 
let me just give you two examples .PERIOD 
which venture capitalist in their right mind is going to give you any money to set up a venture competing with microsoft ,COMMA with microsoft outlook ?QUESTIONMARK no one .PERIOD 
because the professionals ,COMMA over here in these closed organizations - they might be academics ;SEMICOLON they might be programmers ;SEMICOLON they might be doctors ;SEMICOLON they might be journalists - my former profession - say ,COMMA no ,COMMA no - you can't trust these people over here .PERIOD 
they want to ,COMMA as jimmy said ,COMMA they want to have a dialogue ,COMMA a conversation .PERIOD 
what should be the role of public policy ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i was having dinner with this guy called timothy chan .PERIOD 
didn't go into the internet ,COMMA kept his money ,COMMA decided to go into computer games .PERIOD 
at any one time ,COMMA there are four million people playing one of his games .PERIOD 
how many people does he employ to service that population ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA how can he service <NUM> million people from <NUM> employees ?QUESTIONMARK 
imagine you could take all the children in education in britain ,COMMA and one percent of them were co-developers of education .PERIOD 
or if you got one percent of the patients in the nhs to ,COMMA in some sense ,COMMA be co-producers of health .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA i get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners .PERIOD 
and i figured i'd put it on the internet for all employees under stress to help you better deal with what you're going through on your job .PERIOD 
and so i said ,COMMA let's put this together in an album .PERIOD 
we can build all sorts of environments to make it a little bit easier ,COMMA but ultimately ,COMMA what we're trying to do is really connect with one other person .PERIOD 
recording :COLON okay ,COMMA here's something .PERIOD 
but sometimes i feel really lonely .PERIOD 
like even people in convenience stores saying ,COMMA have a nice day ,COMMA when they're accidentally looking me in the eye .PERIOD 
and i got a lot ,COMMA like <NUM> in a half an hour .PERIOD 
i was like ,COMMA i don't know .PERIOD 
but anyway ,COMMA this same person ,COMMA laura ,COMMA ended up emailing me a little bit after that project .PERIOD 
so i asked her ,COMMA what does it feel like when you feel this way ?QUESTIONMARK 
i said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA i'll think about it .PERIOD 
and when you put them together ,COMMA something magical happens ,COMMA something absolutely incredible happens ,COMMA and all of a sudden i get a chorus from around the world .PERIOD 
and over the past <NUM> years ,COMMA i've studied behavior on the basis of everything from genes through neurotransmitters ,COMMA dopamine ,COMMA things like that ,COMMA all the way through circuit analysis .PERIOD 
it's really a very precisely timed thing .PERIOD 
so there is the pattern that every one of them had ,COMMA but they all were a little different too .PERIOD 
a key thing is that the major violence genes ,COMMA it's called the mao-a gene .PERIOD 
it's on the x chromosome .PERIOD and so in this way you can only get it from your mother .PERIOD 
and what i think might happen in these areas of the world ,COMMA where we have constant violence ,COMMA you end up having generations of kids that are seeing all this violence .PERIOD 
now i said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA so what ?QUESTIONMARK we have lizzie .PERIOD 
but it doesn't stop there .PERIOD 
but there's gon na be bad news somewhere .PERIOD 
it's the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA you might be asking ,COMMA why ?QUESTIONMARK 
absolutely everything .PERIOD 
actually ,COMMA if you just look at your thumbnail - about a square centimeter - there are something like <NUM> billion neutrinos per second from the sun ,COMMA passing through every square centimeter of your body .PERIOD 
and these particles have been discovered over the last century ,COMMA pretty much .PERIOD 
one of the wonderful things ,COMMA actually ,COMMA i find ,COMMA is that we've discovered any of them ,COMMA when you realize how tiny they are .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA one of my most illustrious forebears at manchester university ,COMMA ernest rutherford ,COMMA discoverer of the atomic nucleus ,COMMA once said ,COMMA all science is either physics or stamp collecting .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i don't think he meant to insult the rest of science ,COMMA although he was from new zealand ,COMMA so it's possible .PERIOD 
but imagine someone who's not very popular moves through the room .PERIOD 
the picture is that the electrons and the quarks in your body and in the universe that we see around us are heavy ,COMMA in a sense ,COMMA and massive ,COMMA because they're surrounded by higgs particles .PERIOD 
this is a creation story ,COMMA i think ,COMMA equally as wonderful .PERIOD 
so that's the lhc .PERIOD 
when i grew up and realized that science fiction was not a good source for superpowers ,COMMA i decided instead to embark on a journey of real science ,COMMA to find a more useful truth .PERIOD 
by measuring their student smiles ,COMMA researchers were able to predict how fulfilling and long-lasting a subject's marriage will be ,COMMA how well she would score on standardized tests of well-being and how inspiring she would be to others .PERIOD 
outside of this room ,COMMA more than a third of us smile more than <NUM> times per day ,COMMA whereas less than <NUM> percent of us smile less than five .PERIOD 
the finding supported darwin's theory by showing that facial feedback modifies the neural processing of emotional content in the brain in a way that helps us feel better when we smile .PERIOD 
it is a user-appropriate technology that has been used for humanitarian good to great effect .PERIOD 
the grassroots has been strengthened through the social power of sharing and they are challenging the old models ,COMMA the old analog models of control and command .PERIOD 
if you were to arrive in nairobi today and pick up a tourist map ,COMMA kibera is represented as a lush ,COMMA green national park devoid of human settlement .PERIOD 
they're normally backroom or basement hardware service providers ,COMMA but they need to be elevated to software strategists .PERIOD 
but if you're like me ,COMMA my humanity is more like a window .PERIOD 
then suddenly i see it ,COMMA and usually ,COMMA it's never good .PERIOD 
my mother was english .PERIOD 
she was five foot two ,COMMA very feisty and very english .PERIOD 
this is how english my mother is - or was ,COMMA she just passed .PERIOD 
and then we went to a fish restaurant ,COMMA and we had chad ,COMMA the surfer dude ,COMMA serving us ,COMMA and he came up and my mother said ,COMMA do you have any specials ,COMMA young man ?QUESTIONMARK 
and my mother turned to me and said ,COMMA what language is he speaking ?QUESTIONMARK 
but her igbo wasn't too good .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA here are these women ,COMMA who never discuss their period with their husbands ,COMMA and here i am telling them ,COMMA well ,COMMA how often do you get your period ?QUESTIONMARK 
it was my mother with five little children .PERIOD 
can you imagine this five-foot-two woman ,COMMA standing up to men with guns who want to kill us ?QUESTIONMARK 
and she said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you can steel your heart against any kind of trouble ,COMMA any kind of horror .PERIOD 
and then the next planting season ,COMMA when they sang the dirge ,COMMA they would remove as many names of the dead that equaled as many people that were born .PERIOD 
which would seem to suggest that apartheid was entirely the business of men .PERIOD 
their humanity never seems to matter very much to us .PERIOD 
and a lot of rituals involved killing ,COMMA killing little animals ,COMMA progressing along ,COMMA so when i turned <NUM> - and ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA it made sense ,COMMA it was an agrarian community ,COMMA somebody had to kill the animals ,COMMA there was no whole foods you could go and get kangaroo steak at - so when i turned <NUM> ,COMMA it was my turn now to kill a goat .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA when i was growing up ,COMMA he used to tell me stories about how he used to bayonet people ,COMMA and their intestines would fall out ,COMMA but they would keep running .PERIOD 
but he was desperate to show that he'd just come back ,COMMA so he summoned me up ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA go into the bedroom ,COMMA my bedroom .PERIOD 
that's basically how this thing operates .PERIOD 
so one of the advantages of this design is ,COMMA when you scale things down ,COMMA the robot naturally becomes agile .PERIOD 
it's inversely proportional to r .PERIOD 
no matter how you throw it ,COMMA the robot recovers and comes back to him .PERIOD 
so here are robots carrying beams ,COMMA columns and assembling cube-like structures .PERIOD 
so you might want to have multiple robots carry payloads .PERIOD 
so we use a little trick .PERIOD 
they sense their neighbors .PERIOD 
so again the robots monitor this error and calculate the control commands <NUM> times a second ,COMMA which then translates to the motor commands <NUM> times a second .PERIOD 
as you can see here ,COMMA they collapse from a three-dimensional formation into planar formation .PERIOD 
another application i want to show you - again ,COMMA this is in our lab .PERIOD 
so his algorithm essentially tells these robots how to autonomously build cubic structures from truss-like elements .PERIOD 
so all these experiments you've seen thus far ,COMMA all these demonstrations ,COMMA have been done with the help of motion capture systems .PERIOD 
it figures out where it is with respect to the features and then estimates its position <NUM> times a second allowing us to use the control algorithms that i described to you earlier .PERIOD 
you will see nine robots play six different instruments .PERIOD 
let's watch .PERIOD 
unless you're on one of these californian low-carb diets ,COMMA bread is standard .PERIOD 
and i think it is because we feel that this kind of bread really is about authenticity .PERIOD 
and this is about good taste ,COMMA good traditions .PERIOD 
but we have ,COMMA somehow ,COMMA in the course of the last few centuries ,COMMA or even decades ,COMMA started to cultivate an image of a mythical ,COMMA rural agricultural past .PERIOD 
so what is happening ?QUESTIONMARK 
bread has migrated to tropical countries ,COMMA where the middle classes now eat french rolls and hamburgers and where the commuters find bread much more handy to use than rice or cassava .PERIOD 
this is where it all comes from ,COMMA and where these farmers who actually ,COMMA ten thousand years ago ,COMMA put us on the road of bread .PERIOD 
let's go back to traditional farming .PERIOD 
and i'm making a real plea here .PERIOD 
we've moved towards large-scale and very high control .PERIOD 
what i want us to do is to keep up the science and even get more science in there but go to a kind of regional scale - not just in terms of the scale of the fields ,COMMA but in terms of the entire food network .PERIOD 
so what kind of science can we have ?QUESTIONMARK 
we cannot solve the world food problem by using biological agriculture .PERIOD 
everything is linked together .PERIOD 
understand that you are part of this enormous chain of events .PERIOD 
and as you eat it ,COMMA and as you try it - please come and stand up .PERIOD 
every meal you eat contains ingredients from all across the world .PERIOD 
and that ,COMMA i think ,COMMA evolutionarily-speaking is unique .PERIOD 
and today is a time for me to talk to you about water .PERIOD 
this crocodile ,COMMA which grows to almost <NUM> feet long in the northern rivers ,COMMA and this charismatic snake ,COMMA the king cobra .PERIOD 
and it really works to start with them .PERIOD 
the people of this part of india worship the king cobra .PERIOD 
it's just a wresting match ,COMMA but a remarkable activity .PERIOD 
and now the king cobra is a new one .PERIOD 
it survived even during the time that the dinosaurs died off .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA if you see the map ,COMMA the range of their original habitat was all the way from the indus in pakistan to the irrawaddy in burma .PERIOD 
and pretty soon we were seeing sights like this .PERIOD 
this was actually just taken last year .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it seemed that the toxin that was killing the gharial was something in the food chain ,COMMA something in the fish they were eating .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA who is next ?QUESTIONMARK us ?QUESTIONMARK 
we've got a lot of a good team of people working up there .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we can do it .PERIOD 
and there is a gharial looking at us from the river .PERIOD 
namaste .PERIOD 
i look at it as a creature who is totally frightened of something so dangerous as a human being .PERIOD 
you were saying that that hasn't been filmed before .PERIOD 
and the guy who is working there with them ,COMMA he's from maharashtra ,COMMA he said ,COMMA i think he's after the nusha .PERIOD 
whenever he eats the pit viper he gets this little venom rush .PERIOD 
to me ,COMMA that ’ s the real natural wonder .PERIOD 
and the insurance companies found that they began to save almost <NUM> dollars per patient ,COMMA and medicare is now in the middle of doing a demonstration project where they ’ re paying for <NUM> people to go through the program on the sites that we train .PERIOD 
and i ’ ll talk more about this ,COMMA but the real epidemic isn ’ t just heart disease or obesity or smoking - it ’ s loneliness and depression .PERIOD 
and the pain is not the problem :COLON it ’ s the symptom .PERIOD 
what was the biggest selling drug of all time when it was introduced a few years ago ?QUESTIONMARK 
so the very behaviors that we think of as being so sexy in our culture are the very ones that leave so many people feeling tired ,COMMA lethargic ,COMMA depressed and impotent ,COMMA and that ’ s not much fun .PERIOD 
your sexual function improves .PERIOD 
when you eat a big fatty meal ,COMMA how do you feel ?QUESTIONMARK 
you feel kind of sleepy afterwards .PERIOD 
these are not election returns ;SEMICOLON these are the percentage of people who are overweight .PERIOD 
he says ,COMMA i ’ ve got some good news .PERIOD 
what we found was that ,COMMA after a year ,COMMA none of the experimental group patients who made these lifestyle changes needed treatment ,COMMA whereas six of the control-group patients needed surgery or radiation .PERIOD 
and then i wondered :COLON was there any relationship between how much people changed their diet and lifestyle - whichever group they were in - and the changes in psa ?QUESTIONMARK 
the last thing i want to talk about ,COMMA apropos of the issue of the pursuit of happiness ,COMMA is that study after study have shown that people who are lonely and depressed - and depression is the other real epidemic in our culture - are many times more likely to get sick and die prematurely ,COMMA in part because ,COMMA as we talked about ,COMMA they ’ re more likely to smoke and overeat and drink too much and work too hard and so on .PERIOD 
it can be sexual intimacy – i happen to think that healing energy and erotic energy are just different forms of the same thing .PERIOD 
and at the end of it ,COMMA somebody said ,COMMA hey ,COMMA swami ,COMMA what ’ s the difference between wellness and illness ?QUESTIONMARK 
and so he went up on the board and he wrote the word illness ,COMMA and circled the first letter ,COMMA and then wrote the word wellness ,COMMA and circled the first two letters .PERIOD 
and along the way they created a breakthrough in computer visualization .PERIOD 
hopefully it won't stutter .PERIOD 
and if we did our jobs well ,COMMA you won't know that we were even involved .PERIOD 
some you could see ,COMMA some you couldn't .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA there's no use of prosthetic makeup or photography of brad superimposed over another actor's body .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA fincher is an interesting guy .PERIOD 
and so david had an interesting take on the film ,COMMA and he threw a challenge at us .PERIOD 
we went through a process of elimination and a process of discovery with david ,COMMA and we ruled out ,COMMA of course ,COMMA swapping actors .PERIOD 
but we used lots of cheats and shortcuts .PERIOD 
we really felt like we were in a - kind of a 12-step program .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA the first step is :COLON admit you've got a problem .PERIOD 
so we needed a system that would allow benjamin to do everything a human being can do .PERIOD 
and we realized that there was a giant chasm between the state of the art of technology in <NUM> and where we needed it to be .PERIOD 
the state of the art at the time was something called marker-based motion capture .PERIOD 
but we also looked at numbers of other films at the time that were using facial marker tracking ,COMMA and that's the idea of putting markers on the human face and doing the same process .PERIOD 
we needed the subtleties of the skin .PERIOD 
we needed creases and dimples and wrinkles and all of those things .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA clearly ,COMMA we were in a substantially better place for this .PERIOD 
we measure complexity and fidelity of data in terms of polygonal count .PERIOD 
this was the breakthrough .PERIOD 
this is brad doing one of the ekman facs poses .PERIOD 
we shot him with four hd cameras so we'd get multiple views of him and then david would choose the take of brad being benjamin that he thought best matched the footage with the rest of the cast .PERIOD 
and here you can see the body actor .PERIOD 
we also had to create an eye system .PERIOD 
he was very popular .PERIOD 
there were no animators necessary to come in and interpret behavior or enhance his performance .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA as things went through this process ,COMMA fincher would always say ,COMMA it sandblasts the edges off of the performance .PERIOD 
so it sees a smile as a smile .PERIOD 
but we ended up calling the entire process and all the technology emotion capture ,COMMA as opposed to just motion capture .PERIOD 
their teeth are basically bashed out with a metal rod .PERIOD 
and we said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA here is some seed fund .PERIOD 
the women were just not allowed to come out of the community and work with mainstream society .PERIOD so ,COMMA we were able to address that .PERIOD 
we rescued over <NUM> dancing bears .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the end product of that action is up on the board here .PERIOD 
when i started talking to richard about what i was going to speak about ,COMMA i had recently come back from jordan ,COMMA where i had an amazing experience with a camel .PERIOD 
the guys got out ,COMMA they put the hood up ,COMMA they started working under the hood ,COMMA got it going again .PERIOD about a hundred yards ,COMMA it broke down .PERIOD 
and they said ,COMMA ah ,COMMA no problem !EXCLAMATIONMARK we just get out and walk .PERIOD 
and they said ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA we'll walk .PERIOD we'll find some camels .PERIOD 
so we'll need to be very careful around him .PERIOD don't let him get you .PERIOD 
when they're in rut - they're similar to seals in the way ,COMMA like ,COMMA a seal has to open its nose to breathe .PERIOD 
they use them to pinpoint sound .PERIOD 
the desert's extremely windy as well as being very cold .PERIOD 
but they use their tails a lot ,COMMA especially in rut .PERIOD 
but on this particular occasion ,COMMA it was very ,COMMA very clear that as horny as suki was ,COMMA jasmine was having none of it .PERIOD 
so i'm going to show you another film .PERIOD 
but before i do ,COMMA i just want to mention that this animal truly is a sort of the suv of the sand ,COMMA the ship of the desert .PERIOD it's so vital to the inhabitants of the areas in which the camel is found - largely mongolia and sahara - that there are <NUM> words in arabic to describe the camel .PERIOD 
and if this is a creature that was designed by committee ,COMMA it's certainly been like no committee i've ever been on .PERIOD 
so here's what suki would do in search of a mate .PERIOD 
i'm ted camel .PERIOD 
i'm smartly designed .PERIOD 
a distinguished nose ,COMMA with nostrils lined to filter out sand and dust ,COMMA and a groove that catches moisture .PERIOD 
leathery chest pads that beat the heat .PERIOD 
i'm able to lose <NUM> percent of my weight without dying .PERIOD 
humans - the animal - are pretty lucky creatures because ,COMMA by and large ,COMMA we really don't have to adapt to our environment ;SEMICOLON we adapt our environment to us .PERIOD 
but this creature that you've just seen ultimately adapts ,COMMA and keeps adapting and adapting .PERIOD 
and the idea was to have me record some of my poems and then they would find animators to animate them .PERIOD 
writing is not actually as easy as that for me .PERIOD 
poetry just says a few things in different ways .PERIOD 
some days i put the people in their places at the table ,COMMA bend their legs at the knees ,COMMA if they come with that feature ,COMMA and fix them into the tiny wooden chairs .PERIOD 
the name of the author is the first to go ,COMMA followed obediently by the title ,COMMA the plot ,COMMA the heartbreaking conclusion ,COMMA the entire novel ,COMMA which suddenly becomes one you have never read ,COMMA never even heard of .PERIOD 
it's called the country .PERIOD 
and that to me was a bad start to the afterlife ,COMMA having to witness your own funeral and feel gratified .PERIOD 
if it has a subject ,COMMA the subject is adolescence .PERIOD 
frankly ,COMMA who cares if annie oakley was a crack shot at <NUM> or if maria callas debuted as tosca at <NUM> ?QUESTIONMARK 
and here comes a second follower .PERIOD 
now it's not a lone nut ,COMMA it's not two nuts - three is a crowd ,COMMA and a crowd is news .PERIOD 
i was listening to all the experts and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers .PERIOD 
i wrote the book on a treadmill ,COMMA and it took me about a thousand miles to write the book .PERIOD 
i also tried to be the safest person i could be ,COMMA because that's a part of health .PERIOD 
now it's a little extreme ,COMMA i admit .PERIOD 
but if you think about this ,COMMA this is actually - the freakonomics authors wrote about this - that more people die on a per mile basis from drunk walking than from drunk driving .PERIOD 
without the sex part .PERIOD 
and i finally have stabilized .PERIOD 
and i ,COMMA of course ,COMMA don't have time to go into all of them .PERIOD 
it really impairs cognition .PERIOD 
so without noise reduction technology ,COMMA our country would not exist .PERIOD 
and you can almost trick yourself into thinking you're eating doritos .PERIOD 
that's my greatest hope .PERIOD 
what might they find ?QUESTIONMARK 
here's a replica of one such seal .PERIOD 
we need to decipher the script to answer that question .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA the script has become a battleground of sorts between three different groups of people .PERIOD 
if you look at a map of india today ,COMMA you'll see that most of the languages spoken in north india belong to the indo-european language family .PERIOD 
first ,COMMA there's no rosetta stone .PERIOD 
and furthermore ,COMMA we don't even know what language they spoke .PERIOD 
and to make matters even worse ,COMMA most of the text that we have are extremely short .PERIOD 
and why was i fascinated ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i'd like to describe some of the results that we have found .PERIOD 
i'll give you a couple of seconds .PERIOD 
languages contain patterns .PERIOD 
language ,COMMA on the other hand ,COMMA has an intermediate level of entropy ;SEMICOLON it's neither too rigid ,COMMA nor is it too random .PERIOD 
here's a graph that plots the entropies of a whole bunch of sequences .PERIOD 
we found that the indus script actually falls within the range of the linguistic scripts .PERIOD 
who'd have thought that deciphering could be a dangerous profession ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA as the old saying goes ,COMMA if it looks like a linguistic script and it acts like a linguistic script ,COMMA then perhaps we may have a linguistic script on our hands .PERIOD 
so as an example ,COMMA here's a word .PERIOD 
okay .PERIOD great .PERIOD 
so this is just like a crossword puzzle ,COMMA except that this is the mother of all crossword puzzles because the stakes are so high if you solve it .PERIOD 
it contains seven vertical strokes followed by this fish-like sign .PERIOD 
and it turns out that in india there's a long tradition of names being based on horoscopes and star constellations present at the time of birth .PERIOD 
similarly ,COMMA there's another sequence of six stars ,COMMA and that translates to aru meen ,COMMA which is the old dravidian name for the star constellation pleiades .PERIOD 
so that was pretty exciting .PERIOD 
but whilst we have an overwhelmingly vivid visual understanding of space ,COMMA we have no sense of what space sounds like .PERIOD 
now this story doesn't start with vast telescopes or futuristic spacecraft ,COMMA but a rather more humble technology - and in fact ,COMMA the very medium which gave us the telecommunications revolution that we're all part of today :COLON the telephone .PERIOD 
thomas watson spent hours listening to the strange crackles and hisses and chirps and whistles that his accidental antenna detected .PERIOD 
they turned out to be lightning or sources of electrical power .PERIOD 
there was a glitch in their soundtrack .PERIOD 
we do enjoy our misery in a certain way .PERIOD 
because our egocentric perception - from the buddha's point of view ,COMMA misperception - is that all we are is what is inside our skin .PERIOD 
and everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception ,COMMA a little bit ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
like ,COMMA even when you're having a good time ,COMMA when is the good time over ?QUESTIONMARK 
i think the dalai lama should have heard that .PERIOD i wish he'd been there to hear that .PERIOD 
everybody has the wrong idea .PERIOD they think buddha was so boring ,COMMA and they're so surprised when they meet dalai lama and he's fairly jolly .PERIOD 
the human being is almost out of time .PERIOD 
this is birhan ,COMMA who was the ethiopian girl who launched live aid in the <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> minutes away from death when she was rescued ,COMMA and that picture of her being rescued is one that went round the world .PERIOD 
and what do all these pictures and events have in common ?QUESTIONMARK 
what they have in common is what we see unlocks what we cannot see .PERIOD 
what we see unlocks the invisible ties and bonds of sympathy that bring us together to become a human community .PERIOD 
go back <NUM> years when the slave trade was under pressure from william wilberforce and all the protesters .PERIOD 
they won public opinion over a long period of time .PERIOD 
what could they have done with the pictures that they could have shown if they were able to use the modern means of communication to win people ’ s hearts and minds ?QUESTIONMARK 
i was with nelson mandela a year ago ,COMMA when he was in london .PERIOD 
i have just been talking to the president of sierra leone .PERIOD 
i met her in a field ,COMMA she was ragged ,COMMA she had no shoes .PERIOD 
we must then build a proper relationship between the richest and the poorest countries based on our desire that they are able to fend for themselves with the investment that is necessary in their agriculture ,COMMA so that africa is not a net importer of food ,COMMA but an exporter of food .PERIOD 
making people laugh .PERIOD 
so please send me your ideas about how to design a foot .PERIOD 
we have to first know what a foot is .PERIOD 
and i want you to help me do that in this next clip .PERIOD 
see any common themes ?QUESTIONMARK principles ?QUESTIONMARK 
now it turns out that animals can go anywhere .PERIOD 
if you want to study how a foot works ,COMMA we're going to have to simulate those surfaces ,COMMA or simulate that debris .PERIOD 
without a foot ,COMMA here's what it does .PERIOD it doesn't even slow down .PERIOD 
that's a bipedal octopus that's disguised as a rolling coconut .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA you might have noticed something else about the animals when they were running over the rough terrain .PERIOD 
boy :COLON spiny .PERIOD 
do we really understand that principle of tuning ?QUESTIONMARK the answer is ,COMMA yes !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
but look at this animal do it !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
and you probably feel them if you grabbed it .PERIOD 
these are all from different insects .PERIOD 
let's look at that ant .PERIOD 
you see what happens ?QUESTIONMARK 
so to our blueprint ,COMMA we stick on some sticky pads .PERIOD 
these are its feet .PERIOD 
it has a hundred to a thousand split ends ,COMMA and that's the secret ,COMMA because it allows intimate contact .PERIOD 
here you are ,COMMA pulling off the band-aid .PERIOD 
here's the new project :COLON we're trying to create the first climbing search-and-rescue robot - no suction or magnets - that can only move on limited kinds of surfaces .PERIOD 
and here it is coming up at you ,COMMA in its first steps up a wall .PERIOD 
and that's exactly what he's done .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
the first thing that got me interested in the sounds of these underwater animals ,COMMA whose world was so foreign to me ,COMMA was evidence from captive dolphins that captive dolphins could imitate human sounds .PERIOD 
this is a picture of a trainer's whistle ,COMMA a whistle a trainer will blow to tell a dolphin it's done the right thing and can come get a fish .PERIOD 
many mammals have to produce contact calls when ,COMMA say ,COMMA a mother and calf are apart .PERIOD 
what this figure shows is the percentage of the separations in which dolphins whistle ,COMMA against the maximum distance .PERIOD 
so when dolphins are separating by less than <NUM> meters ,COMMA less than half the time they need to use whistles .PERIOD 
most of the time they can just find each other just by swimming around .PERIOD 
and two boats :COLON when the second boat was added ,COMMA what happened was that some of the dolphins left the area completely .PERIOD 
we may need to regulate the intensity of recreational boating and actual whale watching in order to prevent these kinds of problems .PERIOD 
this is a kind of map we've all been looking at .PERIOD 
so you're listening to the complicated song produced by humpbacks here .PERIOD 
and this orange line here marks the typical songs of east coast humpbacks .PERIOD 
it's loud ,COMMA clear - you can hear it very clearly .PERIOD 
but you can still hear that faint call .PERIOD 
this is a figure from a textbook on underwater sound .PERIOD 
now think about it .PERIOD this is an amazing thing :COLON that in this frequency range where whales communicate ,COMMA the main source globally ,COMMA on our planet ,COMMA for the noise comes from human ships ,COMMA thousands of human ships ,COMMA distant ,COMMA far away ,COMMA just all aggregating .PERIOD 
same thing in the north atlantic ,COMMA in the <NUM> versus <NUM> .PERIOD 
so we have to be very concerned about when the noise in habitats degrades the habitat enough that the animals either have to pay too much to be able to communicate ,COMMA or are not able to perform critical functions .PERIOD 
if you actually insulate and isolate the machinery of the ship from the hull ,COMMA you can reduce that noise by <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
what maersk did is they worked ways to slow down .PERIOD 
and third ,COMMA you can create your own tours - you can share them with friends ,COMMA you can create them with friends - and that's the part that i think i'm most excited about because i think that at heart ,COMMA we are all storytellers .PERIOD 
curtis wong :COLON thank you ,COMMA roy .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA microsoft - this is a project that - worldwide telescope is dedicated to jim gray ,COMMA who's our colleague ,COMMA and a lot of his work that he did is really what makes this project possible .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA what you've seen today is less than a fraction of one percent of what is in here ,COMMA and in the ted lab ,COMMA we have a tour that was created by a six-year-old named benjamin that will knock your socks off .PERIOD 
two-thirds of all students in special ed .PERIOD remedial programs are guys .PERIOD 
and we're seeing a steady increase among males .PERIOD 
they're also totally out of sync in romantic relationships ,COMMA which build gradually and subtly .PERIOD 
i can create big things out here ,COMMA but i can go back and really quickly go back to where i started ,COMMA and make even smaller things here .PERIOD 
but the neat thing about it is i can add control points .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA this technique of being able to manipulate a mesh here ,COMMA with multiple control points ,COMMA is actually something that's state of the art .PERIOD 
don't worry .PERIOD 
what we don't agree on is what the problem actually is .PERIOD 
i think none of these is the problem .PERIOD 
we want to go on with our daily life even though we are not living under normal circumstances .PERIOD 
in the end ,COMMA benjamín and julián decided the best thing they could do was to organize the community and act together .PERIOD 
that devotion we feel for the national football team .PERIOD 
we need men and women who love mexico and who are willing to take action .PERIOD 
the battle is won ,COMMA but we still have to fight it .PERIOD 
juggling three balls is simple and normal .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA then you've got to combine them ,COMMA because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you .PERIOD 
and then you get crazy .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i'm actually going to ask you to try something ,COMMA so you've got to pay attention .PERIOD complexity :COLON if you spend enough time doing something ,COMMA time slows down or your skill increases ,COMMA so your perceptions change .PERIOD 
things slow down as you learn ,COMMA as you learn ,COMMA as you learn .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA complexity .PERIOD now ,COMMA how many here are jugglers ?QUESTIONMARK 
ok ,COMMA so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA it looks like a mess .PERIOD it looks like a mess with a guy there ,COMMA who's got his hands around that mess ,COMMA ok .PERIOD 
it's being able to do something that other people can't do or can't understand .PERIOD 
all right .PERIOD so ,COMMA that's one way of doing it ,COMMA which is five balls down .PERIOD 
make it wider .PERIOD 
make it narrower .PERIOD 
enough of a clue ?QUESTIONMARK so ,COMMA you get the pattern ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK ok .PERIOD 
pink .PERIOD 
so white ball and - finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger .PERIOD pink .PERIOD 
finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA pink or finger .PERIOD 
i don't need music for it .PERIOD talking about time in a moment .PERIOD 
ahhh .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA a moment .PERIOD 
ok ?QUESTIONMARK and then ,COMMA what i did as a juggler was say ,COMMA ok ,COMMA what can i do to make that something that is dependent on something else ,COMMA another dynamic .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA a moment .PERIOD 
are we ready to do that ?QUESTIONMARK yes ?QUESTIONMARK 
now ,COMMA i'm going to show you the beginnings of a piece that is about balance in some ways ,COMMA and also - oh ,COMMA actually ,COMMA if you're bored ,COMMA not here ,COMMA here's one use for it .PERIOD 
two sticks ,COMMA you can go with it .PERIOD thanks .PERIOD 
it's a combination of that ,COMMA the beauty of that ,COMMA the shape ,COMMA and the stories that were involved in it ,COMMA as well as the fact that they protected the contents .PERIOD 
and it's going to change as i go through it .PERIOD 
and so it was great fun in those days ,COMMA and some of those of you who are in the audience were my clients .PERIOD 
we'd come in with some prototype underneath a black cloth and we'd put it on the conference table ,COMMA and we'd pull off the black cloth and everybody would ooh and ah .PERIOD 
that was a really good time .PERIOD 
but something's happened in the last <NUM> years since richard started ted ,COMMA and that's that people like us - i know people in other places have caught onto this for a long time ,COMMA but for us ,COMMA we've really just started .PERIOD we've kind of climbed maslow's hierarchy a little bit - and so we're now focused more and more on human-centered design ,COMMA human-centeredness in an approach to design .PERIOD 
and i think you're starting to see that ,COMMA and it's making our job even more enjoyable .PERIOD 
and so in order to do that we've been forming internal video-production groups in order to make these kind of experience prototypes that show just what we mean about the man-machine relationship .PERIOD 
it's kind of like architects who show people in their houses ,COMMA as opposed to them being empty .PERIOD 
so you can see what you look like from the back or all the way around ,COMMA as you look .PERIOD 
this is cbs sunday morning that aired about two weeks ago .PERIOD 
and my favorite feature ,COMMA which is a flower in a vase that wilts when you leave in disappointment ,COMMA and then when you come back ,COMMA it comes up to greet you ,COMMA happy to see you .PERIOD 
the dome has an incredible amount of water that washes off of it ,COMMA as well as wastewater .PERIOD 
the pavilion's design goal was to be kind of quiet and peaceful .PERIOD 
it can dive to <NUM> feet ,COMMA to where sunlight does not penetrate ,COMMA and is equipped with powerful lights .PERIOD 
and so by doing that ,COMMA the woman that you saw in the first thing - she's a school teacher - always wanted to send her kids to college and she's going to be able to do it because of these things .PERIOD 
as in this cryptic sentence i found in the guardian recently :COLON the marriage suffered a setback in <NUM> ,COMMA when the husband was killed by the wife .PERIOD 
we can't see into the engine room .PERIOD 
electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz ,COMMA and there is only energy .PERIOD and you can't see energy .PERIOD 
not only is she aware of her physical repulsiveness ,COMMA she turns it to her advantage .PERIOD 
so he went out and bought a plastic frame to put the photograph in .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA one of the interesting things about invisibility is that things that we can't see we also can't understand .PERIOD 
but we can't read each other's minds .PERIOD i find that quite astonishing .PERIOD 
but their main exercise of telepathy is to send out powerful signals to the rest of us that it doesn't exist .PERIOD 
and this is increasingly peculiar ,COMMA because about <NUM> years ago ,COMMA when they started delving into the genome ,COMMA they thought it would probably contain around <NUM> genes .PERIOD 
you can't see these things ,COMMA but they are very strange .PERIOD 
because that's where all the stuff happens that makes you who you are .PERIOD 
this is fascinating .PERIOD you probably know ,COMMA some of you ,COMMA that cells are continually renewed .PERIOD you can see it in skin and this kind of stuff .PERIOD 
but every cell in your body is replaced at some point .PERIOD 
livers and internal organs sort of take a bit longer .PERIOD a spine takes several years .PERIOD 
there is so many things that - light .PERIOD 
five out of the <NUM> billion galaxies ,COMMA with the naked eye ,COMMA and one of them is quite difficult to see unless you've got very good eyesight .PERIOD 
what the others are here for ,COMMA i've no idea .PERIOD 
so we were thinking ,COMMA well the best way to learn from them is to read all of these millions of books .PERIOD 
now the problem is there's an x-axis for that ,COMMA which is the practical axis .PERIOD 
this is extremely practical ,COMMA but not so awesome .PERIOD 
now again ,COMMA we kind of caved in ,COMMA and we did the very practical approach ,COMMA which was a bit less awesome .PERIOD 
we said ,COMMA well instead of releasing the full text ,COMMA we're going to release statistics about the books .PERIOD 
it's four words ;SEMICOLON we call that a four-gram .PERIOD 
well which one should i use ?QUESTIONMARK 
as of about six months ago ,COMMA the state of the art in this field is that you would ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair ,COMMA and you'd say ,COMMA steve ,COMMA you're an expert on the irregular verbs .PERIOD 
so if you want to become famous early on ,COMMA you should be an actor ,COMMA because then fame starts rising by the end of your <NUM> - you're still young ,COMMA it's really great .PERIOD 
one mistake you should not do is become a mathematician .PERIOD 
here's a simple way to do it .PERIOD 
so for instance ,COMMA here - this suppression index is for <NUM> people picked in english books where there's no known suppression - it would be like this ,COMMA basically tightly centered on one .PERIOD 
what you expect is basically what you observe .PERIOD 
but much more importantly ,COMMA the distribution is much wider .PERIOD 
it's the application of massive-scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture .PERIOD 
there's various types of frustration .PERIOD 
this person studies all the arghs ,COMMA from one through eight a's .PERIOD 
these all happen to be on our computers ,COMMA on computers across the world .PERIOD 
and when that happens ,COMMA that will transform the way we have to understand our past ,COMMA our present and human culture .PERIOD 
one of them is pattern recognition .PERIOD 
we listen to differences ,COMMA we discount sounds that remain the same .PERIOD 
why did i say that ?QUESTIONMARK 
well there are a lot of reasons for this .PERIOD 
and the art of conversation is being replaced - dangerously ,COMMA i think - by personal broadcasting .PERIOD 
and only without conscious listening can these things happen - a world where we don't listen to each other at all ,COMMA is a very scary place indeed .PERIOD 
it's a great exercise for improving the quality of your listening .PERIOD 
so mundane sounds can be really interesting if you pay attention .PERIOD 
you can use this in listening ,COMMA in communication .PERIOD 
why is it not taught ?QUESTIONMARK it's crazy .PERIOD 
thank you for listening to me today .PERIOD 
so what happened was ,COMMA when i was young and got out of engineering school at cornell in <NUM> ,COMMA i decided - i went to work for intel and i was in the computer industry - and three months into that ,COMMA i fell in love with something else ,COMMA and i said ,COMMA i made the wrong career choice here ,COMMA and i fell in love with brains .PERIOD 
we are in the pre-paradigm days ,COMMA if you want to use thomas kuhn .PERIOD 
and theory has not played a role in any sort of grand way in the neurosciences .PERIOD 
you're more complicated than your brain .PERIOD you've got a brain .PERIOD 
that's always been the case .PERIOD and so all we can say ,COMMA well ,COMMA my neocortex ,COMMA which is the part of the brain i'm interested in ,COMMA has <NUM> billion cells .PERIOD 
the best minds were stumped - really ,COMMA really smart people .PERIOD 
it just turns out it's really hard to think of things ,COMMA but once you've thought of them ,COMMA it's kind of easy to understand it .PERIOD 
so it was intuitive and obvious .PERIOD now what about evolution ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i'm going to work you through this in a few slides here ,COMMA give you an example of what this means .PERIOD here's a system .PERIOD 
and alan turing defined the turing test ,COMMA which is essentially saying ,COMMA we'll know if something's intelligent if it behaves identical to a human .PERIOD 
a behavioral metric of what intelligence is ,COMMA and this has stuck in our minds for a long period of time .PERIOD 
you're not aware of this ,COMMA but your eyes are always moving .PERIOD 
it's not always true ,COMMA but in general ,COMMA there's not a good history of theory in biology .PERIOD 
not like computer memory .PERIOD it's not at all like computer memory .PERIOD 
you cannot learn or recall anything outside of a sequence .PERIOD 
if you don't build it ,COMMA you don't understand it .PERIOD so ,COMMA one more slide here .PERIOD 
the new brain is actually kind of easier than the old brain .PERIOD 
but ultimately ,COMMA the world's the limit here .PERIOD 
i don't know how this is going to turn out .PERIOD 
they couldn't anticipate cell phones and the internet and all this kind of stuff .PERIOD 
i do not think about what i consider to be peace ,COMMA which is sustainable peace with justice and equality .PERIOD 
but he's offering <NUM> billion dollars for the modernizing of nuclear weapons .PERIOD 
in global terms ,COMMA it's a little bit of money .PERIOD 
but it's going to modernize weapons we do not need and will not be gotten rid of in our lifetime ,COMMA unless we get up off our .PERIOD 
i was in hiroshima a couple of weeks ago ,COMMA and his holiness - we're sitting there in front of thousands of people in the city ,COMMA and there were about eight of us nobel laureates .PERIOD 
we're staring at everybody ,COMMA waiting our turn to speak ,COMMA and he leans over to me ,COMMA and he says ,COMMA jody ,COMMA i'm a buddhist monk .PERIOD 
i spoke with aung sun suu kyi a couple of days ago .PERIOD 
she said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we have a long road to go to finally get democracy in my country .PERIOD 
here's another woman hero of mine .PERIOD 
she says the airports of the world .PERIOD 
they call her the tree lady ,COMMA but she's more than the tree lady .PERIOD 
this is rigoberta menchu tum .PERIOD 
it's not a dirty word .PERIOD 
it's hard work every single day .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA when she closed the door ,COMMA grandma said ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no .PERIOD 
and they also ,COMMA when they want to travel ,COMMA they use flying machines that can take them to remote destinations .PERIOD 
and they want the washing machine .PERIOD 
and over there they don't even use one each .PERIOD 
what are the trends ?QUESTIONMARK if we just prolong the trends ,COMMA without any real advanced analysis ,COMMA to <NUM> ,COMMA there are two things that can increase the energy use .PERIOD 
and these <NUM> units - still the richest people use most of it .PERIOD 
they must change behavior in some way .PERIOD 
they must also start to produce green energy ,COMMA much more green energy .PERIOD 
i was like ,COMMA okay ,COMMA that's social skill .PERIOD 
you go to an elementary school at three in the afternoon and you watch the kids come out ,COMMA and they're wearing these 80-pound backpacks .PERIOD 
another finding is that the unconscious ,COMMA far from being dumb and sexualized ,COMMA is actually quite smart .PERIOD 
and the way you should do that is study the furniture ,COMMA let it marinate in your mind ,COMMA distract yourself ,COMMA and then a few days later ,COMMA go with your gut ,COMMA because unconsciously you've figured it out .PERIOD 
now i'm a middle-aged guy .PERIOD 
they put them into a brain scan machine - this is apocryphal by the way ,COMMA but i don't care - and they had them watch a horror movie ,COMMA and then they had them describe their feelings toward their wives .PERIOD 
they have trouble relating to other people .PERIOD 
ninety-five percent of our professors report that they are above-average teachers .PERIOD 
they have epistemological modesty .PERIOD 
they are open-minded in the face of ambiguity .PERIOD 
the third trait is metis ,COMMA what we might call street smarts - it's a greek word .PERIOD 
and that comes in tremendously handy ,COMMA because groups are smarter than individuals .PERIOD 
what picasso did ,COMMA for example ,COMMA was take the concept western art and the concept african masks and blend them together - not only the geometry ,COMMA but the moral systems entailed in them .PERIOD 
and these are skills ,COMMA again ,COMMA we can't count and measure .PERIOD 
just to let you know ,COMMA i do not have a lexicographical whistle .PERIOD 
but people think that my job is to let the good words make that difficult left-hand turn into the dictionary ,COMMA and keep the bad words out .PERIOD 
and it's not very fun .PERIOD and when parts of your job are not easy or fun ,COMMA you kind of look for an excuse not to do them .PERIOD 
but why do people want me to direct traffic ,COMMA when i would much rather go fishing ?QUESTIONMARK 
why do i blame the queen ?QUESTIONMARK 
so he's really responsible for a lot of what we consider modern in dictionaries today .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA i'm a huge geek ,COMMA i love computers .PERIOD 
it's steampunk .PERIOD what we have is an electric velocipede .PERIOD 
online dictionaries must be different .PERIOD 
this is flat .PERIOD look how many links there are in the actual entry :COLON two !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
so ,COMMA it's not that we have good words and bad words .PERIOD 
some of my best friends are books .PERIOD 
how can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball-peen hammer ?QUESTIONMARK 
so if we're not worrying about directing traffic ,COMMA if we've transcended paper ,COMMA if we are worrying less about control and more about description ,COMMA then we can think of the english language as being this beautiful mobile .PERIOD 
if only one out of every <NUM> of those books had a word that's not in the dictionary in it ,COMMA that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA it's pretty to look at for a while ,COMMA but then it dies .PERIOD 
we can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers .PERIOD 
i was <NUM> when i was gang-raped by eight men .PERIOD 
but the rest ,COMMA who succumb into it ,COMMA go through everyday torture .PERIOD 
these are men who buy you for an hour ,COMMA for a day ,COMMA and use you ,COMMA throw you .PERIOD 
and we are silent about them .PERIOD 
but the extra bonuses that she gets is various infections ,COMMA sexually transmitted infections ,COMMA hiv ,COMMA aids ,COMMA syphilis ,COMMA gonorrhea ,COMMA you name it ,COMMA substance abuse ,COMMA drugs ,COMMA everything under the sun .PERIOD 
and therefore my challenge was to understand how can i get out the power from this pain .PERIOD 
what has been my challenge ?QUESTIONMARK 
my biggest challenge is society .PERIOD 
it's you and me .PERIOD 
but it is not nice to bring them to our homes .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i'm just going to grab a chair here .PERIOD 
i had this company that i'd spent <NUM> years building .PERIOD it's called future ;SEMICOLON it was a magazine publishing company .PERIOD 
it had recently gone public and the market said that it was apparently worth two billion dollars ,COMMA a number i didn't really understand .PERIOD 
the date was february <NUM> .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA it had to .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK i was in for quite a surprise .PERIOD 
i watched my own net worth falling by about a million dollars a day ,COMMA every day ,COMMA for <NUM> months .PERIOD 
turns out that the research done on that is absolutely mind-blowing .PERIOD 
it's the total brain experience ,COMMA we're going to .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i will .PERIOD here's the vision for ted .PERIOD 
this is a video prototype .PERIOD 
and they don't react to background sounds .PERIOD 
and we were quite intrigued with playing with the notion of invisibility .PERIOD 
soren enters the room .PERIOD pop !EXCLAMATIONMARK he goes invisible .PERIOD 
so people would walking into the room and they'd almost ignore it ,COMMA thinking it was some crap laying around .PERIOD 
so this work is a caricature of an upside-down man .PERIOD 
because if that circle weren't there ,COMMA and the floor was very even ,COMMA it would start to wander about in the space .PERIOD 
that's my colleague .PERIOD he's let it go .PERIOD 
and if it isn't easily gotten ,COMMA we'll go ahead and steal it .PERIOD 
while the carbon dioxide ,COMMA vast quantities of it ,COMMA gigatons ,COMMA goes into the atmosphere where we can't get it back - yet - and where it is causing the problems that we're most concerned about .PERIOD 
they've run out of good sites .PERIOD 
babcock & amp ;SEMICOLON wilcox that make nuclear reactors ,COMMA here's an integral fast reactor .PERIOD 
co2e emissions are equivalent emissions of all the greenhouse gases and particles that cause warming and converted to co2 .PERIOD 
we have facilities around there .PERIOD you also have a buffer zone that's <NUM> square kilometers .PERIOD 
and you have the uranium mining that you have to deal with .PERIOD 
there are two nations ,COMMA north korea and israel ,COMMA that have nuclear weapons and don't have nuclear power at all .PERIOD 
there's plenty of solar and wind .PERIOD 
that's from real data .PERIOD 
solving the world's problems can be done ,COMMA if you really put your mind to it and use clean ,COMMA renewable energy .PERIOD 
and in the united states senate ,COMMA we need bipartisan support - only one or two votes are needed - to move global warming through the senate ,COMMA and this room can help .PERIOD 
the first is :COLON be aware of the propaganda .PERIOD 
and i'm ,COMMA you know ,COMMA very much pro that kind of stuff .PERIOD 
i campaigned against nuclear weapons in the <NUM> ,COMMA and i continue to do so now .PERIOD 
because five years from now ,COMMA it will blow you away what we'll actually have as alternatives to this horrible ,COMMA disastrous nuclear power .PERIOD 
your final pitch ,COMMA stewart .PERIOD 
okay .PERIOD so ,COMMA thank you ,COMMA mark .PERIOD 
it's during our lifetime that we're going to take the earth ,COMMA take the people of earth and transition off ,COMMA permanently .PERIOD and that's exciting .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA i think it is a moral imperative that we open the space frontier .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA it's the first time that we're going to have a chance to have planetary redundancy ,COMMA a chance to ,COMMA if you would ,COMMA back up the biosphere .PERIOD 
and if you think about space ,COMMA everything we hold of value on this planet - metals and minerals and real estate and energy - is in infinite quantities in space .PERIOD 
and we knew nothing about going to space .PERIOD 
we went from having literally put alan shepard in suborbital flight to going to the moon in eight years ,COMMA and the average age of the people that got us there was <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
the shuttle is costing a billion dollars a launch .PERIOD 
as we are going out there and taking on a new frontier ,COMMA we should be allowed to risk .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA anyone who says we shouldn't ,COMMA you know ,COMMA just needs to be put aside ,COMMA because ,COMMA as we go forward ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA the greatest discoveries we will ever know is ahead of us .PERIOD 
and in fact ,COMMA the large corporations ,COMMA the governments ,COMMA can't take the risk .PERIOD 
we've got an altitude call of <NUM> feet .PERIOD 
today ,COMMA you can go and experience weightless flights .PERIOD 
orbital flights - we can take you to the space station .PERIOD 
that was filmed inside our airplane ,COMMA and so ,COMMA you can now do this .PERIOD 
let me talk about the other thing i'm excited about .PERIOD 
it may or may not happen .PERIOD but if you put up a prize ,COMMA the beautiful thing is ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's a very small maintenance fee ,COMMA and you pay on success .PERIOD 
my work is - it's a reflection of myself .PERIOD 
we all seem to think that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA if we look down on the ground ,COMMA there's nothing there .PERIOD 
and we use the word nothing .PERIOD 
i told her i couldn't face it because the way the teacher was treating me ,COMMA ridiculing me ,COMMA and using me as an example of failure .PERIOD 
so i told her .PERIOD 
and walked off .PERIOD and i didn't expect that ,COMMA because i expected one of these .PERIOD 
so i'm sitting there thinking .PERIOD 
so i did .PERIOD 
but i thought ,COMMA perhaps the ant won't know ,COMMA it'll probably move in .PERIOD 
and then i sat down and all the ants came along .PERIOD 
it became part of me .PERIOD 
as you can see ,COMMA that's a pinhead .PERIOD 
now that is called the huf haus .PERIOD 
so i'm thinking ,COMMA mr. huf isn't going to be very happy when i told him his house has gone to another ,COMMA into the atmosphere somewhere .PERIOD 
so to cut the story short ,COMMA i decided that i had to go back and do it .PERIOD 
so i found some more .PERIOD and i decided to ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA construct it very ,COMMA very slowly ,COMMA holding my breath ,COMMA working between my heartbeat ,COMMA and making sure everything is leveled .PERIOD 
i noticed that the house was occupied .PERIOD 
so basically i'd completed the house .PERIOD 
so i didn't think he was going to throw bart off .PERIOD 
and sometimes they turn into little catapults and things go up in the air .PERIOD 
but i would never do it to a living fly .PERIOD 
even though they get on our nerves ,COMMA i would never kill an insect because ,COMMA all creatures great and small - there is a hymn that says that .PERIOD 
so i have to be very very careful .PERIOD 
my work ,COMMA rough estimate ,COMMA sometimes five ,COMMA six to seven weeks ;SEMICOLON you can't always anticipate .PERIOD 
as you can see ,COMMA there's an aphid fly there .PERIOD 
i remember one time i was doing it ,COMMA and the window was open .PERIOD 
and then she looked at me .PERIOD 
and i cut off a little flake of gold .PERIOD 
because i had to put the torch on the top .PERIOD 
the flag had to be made out of little strands of gold .PERIOD 
it's almost like doing a surgical operation to get this thing right .PERIOD 
and that was done with a particle from my shirt .PERIOD 
my point is here ,COMMA people have a choice - just like the indian lady could wear her sari or the japanese woman could wear her kimono .PERIOD 
which is why i prefer the richard wilk analogy of globalizing the local and localizing the global .PERIOD 
and therefore tradition becomes more important ,COMMA not less important .PERIOD 
we're here ,COMMA we're part of a community ,COMMA sharing out ideas and discussing them .PERIOD 
art becomes a very important part of our national identity .PERIOD 
we have done extensive research to ensure that arab and muslim artists ,COMMA and arabs who are not muslims - not all arabs are muslims ,COMMA by the way - but we make sure that they are represented in this new institution .PERIOD 
for me it was a new discovery .PERIOD 
now visual expression is just one form of culture integration .PERIOD 
in a similar way ,COMMA we have created the doha film institute .PERIOD 
who are you playing ?QUESTIONMARK 
the doha tribeca film festival was held at our new cultural hub ,COMMA katara .PERIOD 
i welcome you on board for us to engage and discuss new ideas of how to bring people together through cultural initiatives and discussions .PERIOD 
and in a saying of the koran ,COMMA which to muslims is god speaking to humanity ,COMMA god says to his prophet muhammad - whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets ,COMMA beginning with adam ,COMMA including noah ,COMMA including moses ,COMMA including abraham ,COMMA including jesus christ ,COMMA and ending with muhammad - that ,COMMA we have not sent you ,COMMA o muhammad ,COMMA except as a'rahmah ,COMMA' except as a source of compassion to humanity .PERIOD 
the esoteric path of islam is more popularly known as sufism ,COMMA or tasawwuf in arabic .PERIOD 
the language differs ,COMMA but the objective is the same .PERIOD 
and therefore ,COMMA for us to be human - in the greatest sense of what it means to be human ,COMMA in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human - means that we too have to be proper stewards of the breath of divinity within us ,COMMA and seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of being ,COMMA of being alive ,COMMA of beingness ;SEMICOLON the attribute of wisdom ,COMMA of consciousness ,COMMA of awareness ;SEMICOLON and the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings .PERIOD 
and i believe ,COMMA personally ,COMMA that we're on the verge and that ,COMMA with the presence and help of people like you here ,COMMA we can bring about the prophecy of isaiah .PERIOD 
my story actually began when i was four years old and my family moved to a new neighborhood in our hometown of savannah ,COMMA georgia .PERIOD 
that's why they were called ape hangers .PERIOD 
and one afternoon ,COMMA i got a call from my doctor .PERIOD 
the next day i came to see him .PERIOD i was like ,COMMA doctor ,COMMA that was a really good joke .PERIOD 
i believe my girls will have plenty of opportunities in their lives ,COMMA i wrote these men .PERIOD 
linda ,COMMA my wife ,COMMA joked that it was like having six different marriage proposals .PERIOD 
and on that first day we were in this youth hostel in a castle .PERIOD 
will you help be their dad ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i got to the end - he was crying and i was crying - and then he looked at me ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA yes .PERIOD 
and as he talked he had that glint in his eye that i first saw back in holland - the glint that says ,COMMA let's go cow tipping ,COMMA even though we never did tip the cow ,COMMA even though no one tips the cow ,COMMA even though cows don't sleep standing up .PERIOD 
and then i had a 15-hour surgery in which my surgeon ,COMMA dr. john healey at memorial sloan-kettering hospital in new york ,COMMA took out my left femur and replaced it with titanium .PERIOD 
and anybody who came to see me had to cover themselves in a mask and cover all of the extraneous parts of their body .PERIOD 
when my wife and i had kids ,COMMA we thought it would be all-hands-on-deck .PERIOD 
instead ,COMMA it was everybody running the other way .PERIOD 
and there was something incredibly profound about sitting down with my closest friends and telling them what they meant to me .PERIOD 
now david is my literary agent .PERIOD 
so one day near the end of my journey ,COMMA i said ,COMMA come on girls ,COMMA let's take a walk across the brooklyn bridge .PERIOD 
we set out on crutches .PERIOD 
and yet ,COMMA for the four million years humans have been walking upright ,COMMA the act is essentially unchanged .PERIOD 
as my physical therapist likes to say ,COMMA every step is a tragedy waiting to happen .PERIOD 
you go slow ,COMMA you get where you're going ,COMMA but you get there with this community you built along the way .PERIOD 
so i stand here today as you see now ,COMMA walking without crutches or a cane .PERIOD 
and last week i had my 18-month scans .PERIOD 
and all the collective minds in this room ,COMMA i dare say ,COMMA can never find a solution for scan-xiety .PERIOD 
i feel that i've fitted in ,COMMA in many ways ,COMMA to some of the things that i've heard .PERIOD 
they're fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that's clean ,COMMA a world that isn't contaminated ,COMMA a world that isn't polluted .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA of course ,COMMA my real field of expertise lies in an even different kind of civilization - i can't really call it a civilization .PERIOD 
and i propose to bring into this ted conference ,COMMA as i always do around the world ,COMMA the voice of the animal kingdom .PERIOD 
the chimps - there's no time to discuss their fascinating lives - but they have this long childhood ,COMMA five years of suckling and sleeping with the mother ,COMMA and then another three ,COMMA four or five years of emotional dependence on her ,COMMA even when the next child is born .PERIOD 
they can actually live longer than <NUM> in captivity ,COMMA so we've only done <NUM> years in the wild so far .PERIOD 
we know that chimpanzees and some other creatures can recognize themselves in mirrors - self as opposed to other .PERIOD 
they're disappearing for the reasons that all of you in this room know only too well .PERIOD 
and people will pay more for bush-meat ,COMMA as it's called ,COMMA than for domestic meat - it's culturally preferred .PERIOD 
we can talk about the distant past ,COMMA plan for the distant future ,COMMA discuss ideas with each other ,COMMA so that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group .PERIOD 
and that's not just in the far-away developing world ;SEMICOLON that's everywhere .PERIOD 
somebody said that yesterday .PERIOD 
and roots and shoots is a program for hope .PERIOD 
see the brick walls as all the problems that we've inflicted on this planet .PERIOD 
it isn't something that their parents tell them ,COMMA or their teachers tell them .PERIOD 
that's effective ,COMMA but if they decide themselves ,COMMA we want to clean this river and put the fish back that used to be there .PERIOD 
no violence ,COMMA no bombs ,COMMA no guns .PERIOD 
how many more minutes ?QUESTIONMARK two ,COMMA one ?QUESTIONMARK 
and it's been so clear how much you all care about trying to make this world a better place .PERIOD 
it's very encouraging .PERIOD 
and we've talked a lot about that .PERIOD 
and then as i went around the country after that and felt the fear - the fear that was leading to people feeling they couldn't worry about the environment any more ,COMMA in case they seemed not to be patriotic - and i was trying to encourage them ,COMMA somebody came up with a little quotation from mahatma gandhi ,COMMA if you look back through human history ,COMMA you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good .PERIOD 
and just after that a woman brought me this little bell ,COMMA and i want to end on this note .PERIOD 
it's in our hands .PERIOD 
if we lead lives where we consciously leave the lightest possible ecological footprints ,COMMA if we buy the things that are ethical for us to buy and don't buy the things that are not ,COMMA we can change the world overnight .PERIOD 
in the laboratory what we want to do is much the same ,COMMA but with on the order of tens of different types of molecules - so a drastic reduction in complexity ,COMMA but still trying to produce something that looks lifelike .PERIOD 
this is how we can start to make a protocell .PERIOD 
as you know ,COMMA when you put oil and water together ,COMMA they don't mix ,COMMA but through self-assembly we can get a nice oil droplet to form ,COMMA and we can actually use this as a body for our artificial organism or for our protocell ,COMMA as you will see later .PERIOD 
this structure ,COMMA then ,COMMA can organize the formation of a membrane boundary around itself ,COMMA so it can make a body of liquid molecules around itself ,COMMA and that's shown in green here on this micrograph .PERIOD 
it's actually quite lifeless .PERIOD once it forms ,COMMA it doesn't really do anything .PERIOD 
so some things that are missing is ,COMMA for example ,COMMA if you had a flow of energy through a system ,COMMA what we'd want is a protocell that can harvest some of that energy in order to maintain itself ,COMMA much like living systems do .PERIOD 
so i add some food source to the system .PERIOD 
so then we put these protocells together in a single experiment to see what they would do ,COMMA and depending on the conditions ,COMMA we have some protocells on the left that are moving around and it likes to touch the other structures in its environment .PERIOD 
so then i repeated this experiment a bunch of times ,COMMA and one time something very interesting happened .PERIOD 
so since we can make some interesting protocells that we like ,COMMA interesting colors and interesting behaviors ,COMMA and they're very easy to make ,COMMA and they have interesting lifelike properties ,COMMA perhaps these protocells have something to tell us about the origin of life on the earth .PERIOD perhaps these represent an easily accessible step ,COMMA one of the first steps by which life got started on the early earth .PERIOD 
they look really good ,COMMA very nice movement ,COMMA and also they appear to have some kind of behavior where they kind of circle around each other and follow each other ,COMMA similar to what we've seen before - but again ,COMMA working with just primordial conditions ,COMMA no pure chemicals .PERIOD 
they're even better models of environmental health ,COMMA because not only the same mammalian biology ,COMMA but they share your diet ,COMMA largely .PERIOD 
so they drank as much vodka as they did plain water ,COMMA which was interesting .PERIOD 
i just want to say it was sort of a rule of thumb though ,COMMA there's about two or three fire hydrants on every city block .PERIOD 
they flatten a few plants .PERIOD no big deal ,COMMA they'll regenerate .PERIOD 
that <NUM> percent of the time when a firetruck is not parking there ,COMMA it's infiltrating pollutants .PERIOD 
so these are small actions that can amount to a significant effect to improve local environmental health .PERIOD 
here's one of them that we have up now .PERIOD 
when a fish swims underneath ,COMMA a light goes on .PERIOD 
this is what it looks like .PERIOD 
so there's another function on here .PERIOD 
and they text back .PERIOD 
in this case ,COMMA instead of throwing chewing gum ,COMMA or doritos or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish - there's a body of water in iceland that i've been dealing with that's in the middle of the city ,COMMA and the largest pollution burden on it is not the roadborne pollution ,COMMA it's actually white bread from people feeding the fish and the birds .PERIOD 
they're cross-species delicious that is ,COMMA delicious for humans and non-humans .PERIOD 
and you say ,COMMA boy ,COMMA that's a lot .PERIOD 
but you know what ?QUESTIONMARK 
now ,COMMA if you parked those end to end and wrapped them around the earth ,COMMA that would stretch around the earth <NUM> times .PERIOD 
and we wanted to take advantage of moore's law with electronic controls and software ,COMMA and we absolutely wanted our car to be connected .PERIOD 
so let me talk about hydrogen first .PERIOD 
the beauty of hydrogen is it can come from so many different sources :COLON it can come from fossil fuels ,COMMA it can come from any way that you can create electricity ,COMMA including renewables .PERIOD 
and hydrogen and fuel cells give us that opportunity to actually use our cars and trucks when they're parked to generate electricity for the grid .PERIOD 
and we talked about swarm networks earlier .PERIOD 
actually the theme of this conference ,COMMA i think ,COMMA has hit on really one of the major keys to pull that off - and that's relationships and working together .PERIOD 
i just want to ask one .PERIOD 
we're into this over a billion dollars already ,COMMA so i would hope people would think we're serious when we're spending that kind of money .PERIOD 
in oxford ,COMMA perhaps we can use lewis carroll and look in the looking glass that is new york city to try and see our true selves ,COMMA or perhaps pass through to another world .PERIOD 
my colleagues and i have been working for <NUM> years to rediscover this lost world in a project we call the mannahatta project .PERIOD 
and i'd like to tell you the story in three acts ,COMMA and if i have time still ,COMMA an epilogue .PERIOD 
it was once a beach .PERIOD and this painting has john james audubon ,COMMA the painter ,COMMA sitting on the rock .PERIOD 
or this painting ,COMMA from the <NUM> ,COMMA from greenwich village .PERIOD 
here's bowling green .PERIOD and here's broadway .PERIOD 
and just beyond it you can see features that have vanished ,COMMA things that have disappeared .PERIOD 
or murray hill .PERIOD and this is the murrays' house on murray hill ,COMMA <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
and i thought to myself ,COMMA you know ,COMMA if i could georeference this map ,COMMA if i could place this map in the grid of the city today ,COMMA i could find these lost features of the city ,COMMA in the block-by-block geography that people know ,COMMA the geography of where people go to work ,COMMA and where they go to live ,COMMA and where they like to eat .PERIOD 
then ,COMMA if we added maps like the geology ,COMMA the bedrock geology ,COMMA and the surface geology ,COMMA what the glaciers leave ,COMMA if we make the soil map ,COMMA with the <NUM> soil classes ,COMMA that are defined by the national conservation service ,COMMA if we make a digital elevation model of the topography that tells us how high the hills were ,COMMA then we can calculate the slopes .PERIOD 
we can calculate the aspect .PERIOD 
the white areas on this map are the places protected from the winter winds .PERIOD 
we compiled all the information about where the native americans were ,COMMA the lenape .PERIOD 
and the old fields ,COMMA the successional fields that go .PERIOD 
it was really an extraordinary landscape that was capable of supporting an extraordinary biodiversity .PERIOD 
as if these were the maps that we would need to predict where you would find the beaver .PERIOD 
an aspen needs fire and dry soils .PERIOD 
but what are the conditions that make it possible ?QUESTIONMARK 
and these would be the kind of trees that might have been there ,COMMA and the flowers and the lichens and the mosses ,COMMA the butterflies ,COMMA the fish in the stream ,COMMA the birds in the trees .PERIOD 
and perhaps a black bear walked by .PERIOD and maybe native americans were there .PERIOD 
and we used it to try and reveal a landscape here in act iii .PERIOD 
we can see the fields that the native americans made .PERIOD 
so when you're watching law and order ,COMMA and the lawyers walk up the steps they could have walked back down those steps of the new york court house ,COMMA right into the collect pond ,COMMA <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
and i think this is what we're learning about building cities in the future .PERIOD 
this is the particular additional habitat requirement of humanity .PERIOD 
fill in the blanks .PERIOD 
unfortunately ,COMMA while this society is ,COMMA without a doubt ,COMMA the most prosperous and dynamic the world has ever created ,COMMA it's got some major ,COMMA major flaws .PERIOD 
clearly we don't have <NUM> planets .PERIOD 
and they may not want to live exactly like us .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA so on the one hand we have the unthinkable ;SEMICOLON on the other hand we have the unimaginable .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA what we're out there doing is looking for examples of tools ,COMMA models and ideas ,COMMA which ,COMMA if widely adopted ,COMMA would change the game .PERIOD 
here ,COMMA for example ,COMMA is vancouver ,COMMA which if you haven't been there ,COMMA you ought to go for a visit .PERIOD it's a fabulous city .PERIOD 
but once you also have people living in close proximity to each other ,COMMA one of the things you can do is - as information technologies develop - you can start to have smart places .PERIOD 
they live in the emerging megacities of the developing world .PERIOD 
all throughout the developing world ,COMMA people are going directly to cell phones ,COMMA skipping the whole landline stage .PERIOD 
when you have free ability for people to freely work together and innovate ,COMMA you get different kinds of solutions .PERIOD 
and those solutions are accessible in a different way to people who don't have capital .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's doing something new .PERIOD there's new things happening .PERIOD 
you have other radical examples where the ability to use cultural tools is spreading out .PERIOD 
another world is possible .PERIOD 
we tweak that a lot .PERIOD 
we're looking a lot at this .PERIOD this is spreading everywhere .PERIOD 
this is from a force more powerful .PERIOD it's a little screenshot .PERIOD 
these are refrigerators that require no electricity ;SEMICOLON they're pot within a pot design .PERIOD 
how do we help people like that ?QUESTIONMARK 
audience :COLON it detects landmines .PERIOD 
if you are living in one of the places where the roughly half-billion unaccounted for mines are scattered ,COMMA you can fling these seeds out into the field .PERIOD 
and policing copyright violations for children's birthday cakes was such a hassle that the college bakery said ,COMMA you know what ,COMMA we're getting out of that business .PERIOD 
if you're an amateur ,COMMA you don't have access to our machine anymore .PERIOD 
so the policing layer around the problem becomes the real threat of the act .PERIOD 
and the back story is this :COLON sopa and pipa ,COMMA as legislation ,COMMA were drafted largely by media companies that were founded in the <NUM> century .PERIOD 
and congress did something .PERIOD 
and that law was called the audio home recording act of <NUM> .PERIOD 
so when the audio home recording act of <NUM> was passed ,COMMA the media businesses gave up on the idea of legal versus illegal distinctions for copying because it was clear that if congress was acting in their framework ,COMMA they might actually increase the rights of citizens to participate in our own media environment .PERIOD 
it was a complicated piece of legislation ,COMMA a lot of moving parts .PERIOD 
that is a side effect of their ordinary operation .PERIOD 
every dvd player and game player and television and computer you brought home - no matter what you thought you were getting when you bought it - could be broken by the content industries ,COMMA if they wanted to set that as a condition of selling you the content .PERIOD 
so this is the internet they have in mind .PERIOD 
imagine it says ted ,COMMA because the comments can't be policed at any acceptable cost .PERIOD 
and if you're not an american citizen ,COMMA you can contact american citizens that you know and encourage them to do the same .PERIOD 
and the dmca goes back to the audio home recording act ,COMMA which horrified those industries .PERIOD 
they just want the sharing to go away .PERIOD 
the whole world is laid out for you ,COMMA the best jobs are laid out for you ,COMMA and you want to go and work in a village ?QUESTIONMARK 
what the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college .PERIOD 
you failed in your exam ?QUESTIONMARK 
the education system in india makes you look at paris and new delhi and zurich ;SEMICOLON what are you doing in this village ?QUESTIONMARK 
you have to have a dignity of labor .PERIOD 
a traditional midwife is a professional .PERIOD 
and it's the only college where we don't give a certificate .PERIOD 
so when i said that ,COMMA they said ,COMMA well show us what is possible .PERIOD what are you doing ?QUESTIONMARK 
the men should clear out because we don't want to share this technology with the men .PERIOD 
it's the only college which is fully solar-electrified .PERIOD 
so long as the sun shines ,COMMA we'll have no problem with power .PERIOD 
and we have <NUM> meals twice a day of solar cooking .PERIOD 
she looks after <NUM> goats in the morning ,COMMA but she's prime minister in the evening .PERIOD 
wasn't dazzled at all by what was happening .PERIOD 
where the percentage of illiteracy is very high ,COMMA we use puppetry .PERIOD 
why ?QUESTIONMARK because they want to leave the village and go to a city ,COMMA looking for a job .PERIOD 
comes back ,COMMA goes into the village ,COMMA says ,COMMA well what's the story ?QUESTIONMARK 
they said ,COMMA these two grandmothers .PERIOD grandmothers ?QUESTIONMARK the minister couldn't believe what was happening .PERIOD 
went straight to the president .PERIOD 
so he summoned me and said ,COMMA can you train me <NUM> grandmothers ?QUESTIONMARK 
i said ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA she is very beautiful .PERIOD 
and when i went back six months later ,COMMA i said ,COMMA where's your husband ?QUESTIONMARK 
don't listen to the world bank ,COMMA listen to the people on the ground .PERIOD 
our scientist colleagues are finding new patterns in the information .PERIOD 
for artists ,COMMA we're making new worlds that we can uncover and explore .PERIOD 
the white dots are the probability wave that will show you where the electron is in any given point of time and space in this particular three-orbital configuration .PERIOD 
what kind of remarkable machinery does this guy have in his head ?QUESTIONMARK 
a system of cognitive processes ,COMMA largely non-conscious cognitive processes ,COMMA that help them change their views of the world ,COMMA so that they can feel better about the worlds in which they find themselves .PERIOD 
who are these characters who are so damn happy ?QUESTIONMARK 
some of you are old enough to remember :COLON he was the chairman of the house of representatives and he resigned in disgrace when this young republican named newt gingrich found out about a shady book deal he had done .PERIOD 
so he went to find them .PERIOD they said ,COMMA we can give you a franchise on this for <NUM> bucks .PERIOD 
and finally :COLON never ever join the beatles .PERIOD 
in this case ,COMMA because the experiment i'm going to tell you about uses them ,COMMA these are monet prints .PERIOD 
we did this experiment with a group of patients who had anterograde amnesia .PERIOD these are hospitalized patients .PERIOD 
we then gave them the choice between number three and number four .PERIOD 
really ,COMMA jim ,COMMA you don't remember ?QUESTIONMARK i was just here with the monet prints ?QUESTIONMARK 
free ?QUESTIONMARK aren't you just giving me my own paper ?QUESTIONMARK 
what are you doing ?QUESTIONMARK 
they don't like their picture ,COMMA and in fact even after the opportunity to swap has expired ,COMMA they still don't like their picture .PERIOD why ?QUESTIONMARK 
we could do it so that when you take the two pictures ,COMMA you'd have four days to change your mind ,COMMA or we're doing another course where you take the two pictures and you make up your mind right away and you can never change it .PERIOD which course would you like to be in ?QUESTIONMARK 
let me parenthetically pause here and tell you - esther ,COMMA my mother ,COMMA had stopped driving several years ago ,COMMA to the collective relief of the entire city of atlanta .PERIOD 
there's a historical marker .PERIOD 
i guess i must .PERIOD 
oh ,COMMA jesus .PERIOD 
puts it in reverse .PERIOD fifty-five out of the driveway ,COMMA in reverse .PERIOD 
i've got a white-knuckle grip on the door .PERIOD you know what i'm talking about ?QUESTIONMARK 
and there she goes ,COMMA right .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA so i stopped at a light and there's a guy ,COMMA you know ,COMMA in the back .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA you have all been at a mall during the holidays ,COMMA yes ?QUESTIONMARK 
it will upset you .PERIOD 
look ,COMMA the chevy - he's coming this way .PERIOD 
how many of you once in your - you were a kid ,COMMA you were an adult - you stood in a parking space to hold it for someone ?QUESTIONMARK 
of course ,COMMA her comeback is ,COMMA when have i embarrassed you ?QUESTIONMARK 
a brevity ,COMMA brevity of everything with this child .PERIOD 
but she pauses occasionally and says ,COMMA how do you spell that ?QUESTIONMARK what year ?QUESTIONMARK ok .PERIOD 
when she writes the expose in about <NUM> years ,COMMA don't believe a word of it .PERIOD 
but this is my daughter ,COMMA lauren ,COMMA my remarkable daughter ,COMMA my borderline asperger's kid .PERIOD 
she says ,COMMA ma ,COMMA you got to look !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
now ,COMMA when this kid says i got to look ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
oh ,COMMA jesus .PERIOD oh ,COMMA jesus .PERIOD 
i finally come - and now ,COMMA it's the south .PERIOD 
we want to curl up and say ,COMMA tell it to me ,COMMA tell it to me .PERIOD 
i'm with the little lady .PERIOD damn !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
after i say - let me refresh you - have you no shame ?QUESTIONMARK 
with her is a young man - husband ,COMMA brother ,COMMA lover ,COMMA it's not my job .PERIOD 
they turn then ,COMMA shoulder to shoulder ,COMMA and walk away ,COMMA lost in their own reverie .PERIOD 
and they use motors that literally are used on cruise missile boosters .PERIOD 
voices :COLON woohoo !EXCLAMATIONMARK yeah .PERIOD nice .PERIOD 
what are catastrophic effects ?QUESTIONMARK a three degree centigrade climate change rise that will result in <NUM> percent species extinction .PERIOD 
but now i'll talk about some more pleasant things .PERIOD 
how fabulous .PERIOD why would you ever want to go by yourself in your own car ?QUESTIONMARK 
where can i go today and who can i do it with ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's when you charge a premium for people to drive on congested roads .PERIOD 
in london ,COMMA the day they turned the congestion pricing on ,COMMA there was a <NUM> percent decrease in congestion overnight ,COMMA and that's persisted for the four years in which they've been doing congestion pricing .PERIOD 
you weren't going to put tollbooths around the city of london and open and shut those gates .PERIOD 
and road pricing is where we're all going to have to go ,COMMA because today we pay for our maintenance and wear and tear on our cars with gas taxes .PERIOD 
and if we have it ,COMMA you'll decide how many miles to drive ,COMMA what mode of travel ,COMMA where to live and work .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA all mesh-enabled .PERIOD monthly communication cost :COLON zero .PERIOD 
they're resilient ;SEMICOLON their redundancy is built into this fabulous decentralized design .PERIOD 
these things are going to happen .PERIOD 
maybe we shouldn't wait for the <NUM> or <NUM> years for this to happen .PERIOD 
and if i had my druthers ,COMMA we would have an open-source version in addition to open standards .PERIOD 
when i went this morning to larry brilliant's tedtalk prize - his fabulous networks - imagine if there was an open-source mesh communications device that can be put into those networks ,COMMA to make all that happen .PERIOD 
so the awesome story :COLON it begins about <NUM> years ago ,COMMA when my mom and my dad came to canada .PERIOD 
my dad left a small village outside of amritsar ,COMMA india .PERIOD 
and they got here in the late <NUM> .PERIOD 
we grew up taking for granted a lot of the things that my parents couldn't take for granted when they grew up - things like power always on in our houses ,COMMA things like schools across the street and hospitals down the road and popsicles in the backyard .PERIOD 
so you can't actually see them ,COMMA but it was breathtaking ,COMMA believe me .PERIOD 
my marriage wasn't going well ,COMMA and we just were growing further and further apart .PERIOD 
one day my wife came home from work and summoned the courage ,COMMA through a lot of tears ,COMMA to have a very honest conversation .PERIOD 
and as these dark clouds were circling me ,COMMA and i was finding it really ,COMMA really difficult to think of anything good ,COMMA i said to myself that i really needed a way to focus on the positive somehow .PERIOD 
and nobody read it except for my mom .PERIOD 
flash-forward to the next year and the book of awesome has now been number one on the bestseller list for <NUM> straight weeks .PERIOD 
but look ,COMMA i said i wanted to do three things with you today .PERIOD 
it's sad ,COMMA and it's not pleasant to talk about ,COMMA but your husband might leave you ,COMMA your girlfriend could cheat ,COMMA your headaches might be more serious than you thought ,COMMA or your dog could get hit by a car on the street .PERIOD 
and there are times in life when you will be tossed in the well ,COMMA too ,COMMA with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart ,COMMA and when that bad news washes over you ,COMMA and when that pain sponges and soaks in ,COMMA i just really hope you feel like you've always got two choices .PERIOD 
because you all used to be three years old .PERIOD 
that three-year-old girl is still part of you .PERIOD 
these were four guys on the l.a. rams in the <NUM> you did not want to go up against .PERIOD 
i'd like to pause my tedtalk for about <NUM> seconds right now ,COMMA because you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this ,COMMA and my parents are sitting in the front row .PERIOD 
he would say ,COMMA look ,COMMA can you believe they have a mango here from mexico ?QUESTIONMARK 
you can sleep in clean sheets .PERIOD 
the cashiers at your grocery store ,COMMA the foreman at your plant ,COMMA the guy tailgating you home on the highway ,COMMA the telemarketer calling you during dinner ,COMMA every teacher you've ever had ,COMMA everyone that's ever woken up beside you ,COMMA every politician in every country ,COMMA every actor in every movie ,COMMA every single person in your family ,COMMA everyone you love ,COMMA everyone in this room and you will be dead in a hundred years .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
dan rather :COLON since the september <NUM> attack on the world trade center ,COMMA many people have flocked to downtown new york to see and pay respects at what amounts to the 16-acre burial ground .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA as cbs's jim axelrod reports ,COMMA they're putting the finishing touches on a new way for people to visit and view the scene .PERIOD 
there's a new place in new york where the crowds are thickest - ground zero .PERIOD 
this is ours .PERIOD 
david rockwell :COLON the first experience people will have here when they see this is not as a construction site but as this incredibly moving burial ground .PERIOD 
the walls are bare by design ,COMMA so people can fill them with their own memorials the way they already have along the current perimeter .PERIOD 
your work is highly sensual ,COMMA even hedonistic .PERIOD 
but i've got to tell you - it became impossible to do that .PERIOD 
we were really paralyzed .PERIOD 
and in discussing this with other architects ,COMMA we had seen people saying in the press that they should rebuild the towers as they were - they should rebuild them <NUM> stories taller .PERIOD 
it was predominantly a white ,COMMA rich ,COMMA corporate group that was not representative of the city .PERIOD 
and i think this was the <NUM> ,COMMA and we knew this had to be built and up by the <NUM> .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA it was as if this was going to be window-washing scaffolding .PERIOD 
and i've got to say that we spent a lot of time in putting this together ,COMMA watching the crowds that gathered at saint paul - which is just to the right - and moving around the site .PERIOD 
no .PERIOD in fact i told the contractor to go ahead .PERIOD 
i think this is ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA substantially different from anything we'd ever thought about doing before ,COMMA just by the nature of it .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA i think one thing that shouldn't be done is evaluate - i think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan .PERIOD 
i don't think it has much to do with <NUM> or <NUM> or <NUM> or <NUM> thousand new office spaces ,COMMA regardless of what the number is .PERIOD 
and in fact ,COMMA there's a proposal on the table now for building number seven .PERIOD 
right ,COMMA which the towers fell into .PERIOD 
and the reason that's been held up is essentially by community outrage that they're not re-opening the street to connect that back to the rest of the city .PERIOD 
this small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help .PERIOD 
so i thought that would be good to end with .PERIOD 
one of the tricky issues we had with the giuliani administration was i had forgotten how anti-graffiti he was .PERIOD 
and essentially our structure was designed to be written on .PERIOD 
as you say ,COMMA it's not a memorial .PERIOD 
but the kind of virtually instantaneous nature of its erection ,COMMA and its being there ,COMMA almost before you could believe that a response of this magnitude could be accomplished ,COMMA is part of its extraordinary - i don't know if beauty is the word - but presence .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA a funny thing happened on my way to becoming a brilliant ,COMMA world-class neuropsychologist :COLON i had a baby .PERIOD 
sorry ,COMMA ted .PERIOD 
because this is what i do .PERIOD this is what i teach .PERIOD 
so look to the right-hand side of the screen .PERIOD 
would it be crazy to know ,COMMA <NUM> gs .PERIOD 
how do we know that legislation that would require that they be pulled from play ,COMMA cleared for return to play ,COMMA applies to them ?QUESTIONMARK 
if ,COMMA god forbid ,COMMA any of us left here tonight and sustained a concussion ,COMMA most of us would go on to fully recover inside of a couple hours to a couple of weeks .PERIOD 
should your kid play football ?QUESTIONMARK i don't know .PERIOD 
the first :COLON study up .PERIOD 
we've just rolled this out in the last couple months - co kids with brain injury .PERIOD 
now i thought that it was because i have this totally compelling helmet crusade ,COMMA right ,COMMA this epiphany of tom's .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
this is but one :COLON this is frank gehry the architect's precursor to the guggenheim in abu dhabi .PERIOD 
so my first topic with respect to this ,COMMA was not death ,COMMA but obesity .PERIOD 
so this is a slide of some of our initial results .PERIOD 
how big are the clusters ?QUESTIONMARK how far do they reach ?QUESTIONMARK 
this here shows ,COMMA on the y-axis ,COMMA the increase in the probability that a person is obese given that a social contact of theirs is obese and ,COMMA on the x-axis ,COMMA the degrees of separation between the two people .PERIOD 
there are at least three possibilities :COLON one possibility is that ,COMMA as i gain weight ,COMMA it causes you to gain weight .PERIOD 
another more subtle possibility is that they start gaining weight ,COMMA and it changes your ideas of what an acceptable body size is .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i want to be very clear :COLON we do not think our work should or could justify prejudice against people of one or another body size at all .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA by the end ,COMMA you're going to see clusters of obese and non-obese individuals within the network .PERIOD 
and so this function of emotions suggests that ,COMMA in addition to any other purpose they serve ,COMMA they're a kind of primitive form of communication .PERIOD 
and whether you become happy or not depends in part on whether you occupy a happy patch .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this work with emotions ,COMMA which are so fundamental ,COMMA then got us to thinking about :COLON maybe the fundamental causes of human social networks are somehow encoded in our genes .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA the striking patterns of human social networks ,COMMA their ubiquity and their apparent purpose beg questions about whether we evolved to have human social networks in the first place ,COMMA and whether we evolved to form networks with a particular structure .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA finally ,COMMA compare nodes c and d :COLON c and d both have six friends .PERIOD 
but now we ,COMMA with a bird's eye view looking at this network ,COMMA can see that they occupy very different social worlds .PERIOD 
so different structural locations have different implications for your life .PERIOD 
they are a kind of social capital .PERIOD 
new properties emerge because of our embeddedness in social networks ,COMMA and these properties inhere in the structure of the networks ,COMMA not just in the individuals within them .PERIOD 
they're both made of carbon ,COMMA and yet one of them has carbon atoms in it that are arranged in one particular way - on the left - and you get graphite ,COMMA which is soft and dark .PERIOD 
if i was always violent towards you or gave you misinformation or made you sad or infected you with deadly germs ,COMMA you would cut the ties to me ,COMMA and the network would disintegrate .PERIOD 
i'd never seen anything like that .PERIOD 
but after seeing what i've seen ,COMMA the truth is ,COMMA they have not disappeared at all .PERIOD 
and this is happening every day .PERIOD 
and from these bedrooms and living rooms and garages ,COMMA with cheap webcams ,COMMA lies the world's great dancers of tomorrow .PERIOD 
and you let it go ,COMMA and then right when you see the tail ,COMMA you grab it by the tail ,COMMA then you bring it back in .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA you create power ,COMMA then you tame it .PERIOD 
according to the treaty ,COMMA those lands are a sovereign nation .PERIOD 
<NUM> :COLON the second fort laramie treaty clearly guarantees the sovereignty of the great sioux nation and the lakotas' ownership of the sacred black hills .PERIOD 
a new agreement was presented to sioux chiefs and their leading men under a campaign known as sell or starve :COLON sign the paper ,COMMA or no food for your tribe .PERIOD 
reservations are cut up into 160-acre sections and distributed to individual indians with the surplus disposed of .PERIOD 
tribes lost millions of acres .PERIOD 
to this day ,COMMA this is the most medals of honor ever awarded for a single battle .PERIOD 
unemployment on the pine ridge indian reservation fluctuates between <NUM> and <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
this is how we came to own these united states .PERIOD 
and how much of this history do you need to own ,COMMA even ?QUESTIONMARK 
because the solution seems so far in the past ,COMMA i needed nothing short of a time machine to access them .PERIOD 
that's why there's a glass of water up there .PERIOD 
this solution has been called ,COMMA by some ,COMMA potentially the most important medical advance this century .PERIOD 
and what it was was oral rehydration salts .PERIOD 
maybe there's a biological answer .PERIOD 
see ,COMMA we spent a lot of energy ,COMMA in many domains - technological ,COMMA scientific ,COMMA hard work ,COMMA creativity ,COMMA human ingenuity - to crack important social problems with technology solutions .PERIOD 
here i have a bunch of other examples ,COMMA all suffer from the last mile problem .PERIOD 
the last mile is ,COMMA everywhere ,COMMA problematic .PERIOD 
the problem is this little three-pound machine that's behind your eyes and between your ears .PERIOD 
they do lots of inconsistent things .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA diarrhea's interesting because it's been around for thousands of years ,COMMA ever since humankind really lived side by side enough to have really polluted water .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA think of the mental model that goes behind reducing the intake .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA here you all are ,COMMA ostensibly educated people .PERIOD 
most of you look smart .PERIOD 
i think we've learned the answer to that here .PERIOD 
almost out of kindergarten .PERIOD 
these models ,COMMA like the leaky bucket ,COMMA work well in most situations .PERIOD 
they are situations where the mental model doesn't match the reality .PERIOD 
so now ,COMMA while you're thinking about that let's move to a second task .PERIOD 
fifty versus <NUM> ,COMMA that's a big move .PERIOD eleven versus nine ?QUESTIONMARK come on .PERIOD 
so far ,COMMA i've been pretty negative .PERIOD 
you just got ta carry this thing around .PERIOD 
here's another example of this .PERIOD 
this is from a company called positive energy .PERIOD 
and what they find is just this letter ,COMMA nothing else ,COMMA has a two to three percent reduction in electricity use .PERIOD 
we have testing ,COMMA we go to the lab ,COMMA we try it again ,COMMA we have refinement .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this whole area is so fascinating .PERIOD 
how you take your insights here and actually get them integrated into working business models on the ground ,COMMA in indian villages ,COMMA for example ?QUESTIONMARK 
we work closely with companies that have operational capacity ,COMMA or nonprofits that have operational capacity .PERIOD 
if you have biological problems we try and fix it ,COMMA see if it works ,COMMA and then work the scale .PERIOD 
when the magazine - actually ,COMMA when i got the subscription - it was <NUM> following pages .PERIOD

come to - no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no .PERIOD 
when i'm sober ,COMMA i do this much quicker ,COMMA but we will check .PERIOD

thank you .PERIOD 
here's what he did .PERIOD he gathered his participants .PERIOD 
if you're the fastest of everyone we're testing here today ,COMMA you get <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
but for a lot of tasks ,COMMA they actually either don't work or ,COMMA often ,COMMA they do harm .PERIOD 
if you look at the science ,COMMA there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does .PERIOD 
but for <NUM> century tasks ,COMMA that mechanistic ,COMMA reward-and-punishment approach doesn't work ,COMMA often doesn't work ,COMMA and often does harm .PERIOD 
same deal .PERIOD you :COLON we're timing for norms .PERIOD 
low-cost providers around the world can do it cheaper .PERIOD 
the rules are mystifying .PERIOD 
okay ?QUESTIONMARK but one the task called for even rudimentary cognitive skill ,COMMA a larger reward led to poorer performance .PERIOD 
people offered the medium level of rewards did no better than people offered the small rewards .PERIOD 
in eight of the nine tasks we examined across three experiments ,COMMA higher incentives led to worse performance .PERIOD 
last month ,COMMA just last month ,COMMA economists at lse looked at <NUM> studies of pay-for-performance plans ,COMMA inside of companies .PERIOD 
there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does .PERIOD 
purpose :COLON the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves .PERIOD 
traditional notions of management are great if you want compliance .PERIOD 
a few times a year they tell their engineers ,COMMA go for the next <NUM> hours and work on anything you want ,COMMA as long as it's not part of your regular job .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA being australians ,COMMA everybody has a beer .PERIOD 
that one day of intense autonomy has produced a whole array of software fixes that might never have existed .PERIOD 
they have autonomy over their time ,COMMA their task ,COMMA their team ,COMMA their technique .PERIOD 
autonomy ,COMMA mastery and purpose ,COMMA versus carrot and sticks .PERIOD and who wins ?QUESTIONMARK 
three :COLON the secret to high performance isn't rewards and punishments ,COMMA but that unseen intrinsic drive - the drive to do things for their own sake .PERIOD 
so this ,COMMA again ,COMMA is on the subject - a slice from the equator of the earth .PERIOD 
it turns once per day in synchrony with the earth .PERIOD 
this would be grown ,COMMA i suppose ,COMMA with nanotechnology in the future sometime .PERIOD 
so if we could roll the next film here .PERIOD 
this has evolved over the years in a lot of different iterations .PERIOD 
the idea of this air genie is ,COMMA it's something that can just transform and become anything .PERIOD

now ,COMMA either he is senile ,COMMA and doesn't remember his own music ,COMMA because he wrote the music .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA no ,COMMA he doesn't want that .PERIOD that's a different kind of control .PERIOD 
once like a muti ,COMMA and you'll - - clap ,COMMA just once .PERIOD 
and then like karajan .PERIOD let's see what happens .PERIOD okay ?QUESTIONMARK 
and when karajan is asked about it he actually says ,COMMA yes ,COMMA the worst damage i can do to my orchestra is to give them a clear instruction .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA it is different .PERIOD but isn't that controlling in the same way ?QUESTIONMARK 
look at the eyes .PERIOD 
and you're playing a painful sound .PERIOD 
now it's a reversed thing .PERIOD you're telling the story .PERIOD and you're telling the story .PERIOD 
but all my work for many years was focused around the idea that sustainability means basically looking at the globalized economic growth model ,COMMA and moderating what comes in at one end ,COMMA and moderating the outputs at the other end .PERIOD 
if you could help me with that it would be fantastic .PERIOD 
it's open source .PERIOD it's something which everybody who's involved with it develops and passes on as they work with it .PERIOD 
it's self-organizing .PERIOD there is no great central organization that pushes this ;SEMICOLON people just pick up an idea and they run with it ,COMMA and they implement it where they are .PERIOD 
and it's really about how systems ,COMMA settlements ,COMMA withstand shock from the outside .PERIOD 
when our supermarkets have only two or three days' worth of food in them at any one time ,COMMA often sustainability tends to focus on the energy efficiency of the freezers and on the packaging that the lettuces are wrapped up in .PERIOD 
it's a process which is playful and creative and informative .PERIOD 
and there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mulling stage .PERIOD 
a lot of places are working with their local schools .PERIOD 
and also starting to play around with the idea of alternative currencies .PERIOD 
and we see it all over the place as well now .PERIOD 
this is probably the most boring topic of the whole morning .PERIOD 
many of the people involved have special interests or short-term interests that get them not thinking about what the implications of the trends are .PERIOD 
now how did we get here ?QUESTIONMARK 
they make you pay more in withholding just to help their cash flow out .PERIOD 
and california's not unique .PERIOD 
there's ways ,COMMA if it's temporary ,COMMA to minimize the impact ,COMMA but it's a problem .PERIOD 
well you have to allocate dollars for that system and for that incentive pay .PERIOD 
well there really is no brain trust .PERIOD 
so what do we need to do ?QUESTIONMARK 
whenever they say there's these long-term problems ,COMMA we can't say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA you're the messenger with bad news ?QUESTIONMARK 
now i think this is a solvable problem .PERIOD 
what do i know that would cause me ,COMMA a reticent ,COMMA midwestern scientist ,COMMA to get myself arrested in front of the white house protesting ?QUESTIONMARK 
did it mean that venus had an ionosphere ?QUESTIONMARK

its changes will affect all of humanity .PERIOD 
british physicist john tyndall ,COMMA in the <NUM>'s ,COMMA made laboratory measurements of the infrared radiation ,COMMA which is heat .PERIOD 
most of the things mentioned in our <NUM> paper were facts .PERIOD 
i had the privilege to speak twice to the president's climate task force .PERIOD 
let me describe the most important conclusion from the physics - first ,COMMA from earth's energy balance and ,COMMA second ,COMMA from earth's climate history .PERIOD 
now finally ,COMMA we can measure earth's energy imbalance precisely by measuring the heat content in earth's heat reservoirs .PERIOD 
the biggest reservoir ,COMMA the ocean ,COMMA was the least well measured ,COMMA until more than <NUM> argo floats were distributed around the world's ocean .PERIOD 
yet ,COMMA there was more energy coming in than going out .PERIOD 
these curves for global temperature ,COMMA atmospheric co2 and sea level were derived from ocean cores and antarctic ice cores ,COMMA from ocean sediments and snowflakes that piled up year after year over <NUM> years forming a two-mile thick ice sheet .PERIOD 
and more co2 causes more warming .PERIOD 
so co2 ,COMMA methane ,COMMA and ice sheets were feedbacks that amplified global temperature change causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge ,COMMA even though the climate change was initiated by a very weak forcing .PERIOD 
and the rate has accelerated since the measurements began nine years ago .PERIOD 
ice sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries .PERIOD 
what may be more reprehensible ,COMMA if climate denial continues ,COMMA is extermination of species .PERIOD 
an important impact ,COMMA if global warming continues ,COMMA will be on the breadbasket of our nation and the world ,COMMA the midwest and great plains ,COMMA which are expected to become prone to extreme droughts ,COMMA worse than the dust bowl ,COMMA within just a few decades ,COMMA if we let global warming continue .PERIOD 
i need your help to communicate the gravity and the urgency of this situation and its solutions more effectively .PERIOD 
a parachute jump from the very edge of space .PERIOD 
what i'd like to do first is take you through a very brief helicopter ride of stunts and the stunts industry in the movies and in television ,COMMA and show you how technology has started to interface with the physical skills of the stunt performer in a way that makes the stunts bigger and actually makes them safer than they've ever been before .PERIOD 
i'm a stunt coordinator .PERIOD and as well as perform stunts i often design them .PERIOD 
what safety they had was very scant .PERIOD 
this is the first stunt woman ,COMMA rosie venger ,COMMA an amazing woman .PERIOD 
yakima canutt really formed the stunt fight .PERIOD 
talking of dangerous stunts and bringing things slightly up to date ,COMMA some of the most dangerous stunts we do as stunt people are fire stunts .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA we used to use trampettes .PERIOD in the old days ,COMMA that's all they had .PERIOD 
and that's a ramp .PERIOD spring off the thing and fly through the air ,COMMA and hopefully you make it look good .PERIOD 
now we've got technology .PERIOD this thing is called an air ram .PERIOD 
rolling a car over is another area where we use technology .PERIOD 
that's a long way to fall ,COMMA if you get it wrong .PERIOD that was just about right .PERIOD 
this is a shot of terminator ,COMMA the movie .PERIOD 
it's <NUM> feet .PERIOD it's water .PERIOD it's very simple .PERIOD 
this guy is not skydiving .PERIOD he's being flown like a kite ,COMMA or moved around like a kite .PERIOD 
it's that shape because the helium has to expand .PERIOD 
certainly at <NUM> feet no aircraft will fly .PERIOD 
we will have two balloons for each of my test jumps ,COMMA and two balloons for the main jump ,COMMA because they notoriously tear on takeoff .PERIOD 
a drogue chute is just a smaller chute which helps to keep your face down .PERIOD 
it's hundreds of feet high .PERIOD it's enormous .PERIOD 
it's a three sided box ,COMMA basically .PERIOD 
that's the prototype of the parachute .PERIOD i've now had them custom make one ,COMMA the only one of its kind in the world .PERIOD and that's the only suit of its kind in the world .PERIOD 
then they're comfortable ,COMMA they have good vision ,COMMA like this great big visor .PERIOD 
and then if the cabin depressurizes while the aircraft is coming back down ,COMMA in whatever emergency measures ,COMMA everyone is okay .PERIOD 
but if you are ,COMMA and you say to somebody ,COMMA you know ,COMMA they say ,COMMA what do you do ?QUESTIONMARK

what you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent .PERIOD and my contention is ,COMMA all kids have tremendous talents .PERIOD

benign advice - now ,COMMA profoundly mistaken .PERIOD the whole world is engulfed in a revolution .PERIOD 
secondly ,COMMA intelligence is dynamic .PERIOD

i grew up at a time when iconic actors from kuwait ,COMMA syria ,COMMA egypt used laughter to unite the region ,COMMA just as football can .PERIOD 
also ,COMMA three guys working for years in los angeles ,COMMA an iranian ,COMMA a palestinian and an egyptian ,COMMA created the aptly named axis of evil comedy act .PERIOD

i invited our new ceo ,COMMA and as soon as he realized we had a room packed full of laughing infidels ,COMMA his reaction was very simple :COLON let's make this happen .PERIOD

as my father likes to call him ,COMMA asheikh azubare ;SEMICOLON as my mother would say ,COMMA shakespeare .PERIOD

it was very difficult not to get scared ,COMMA not to get daunted .PERIOD 
we want to take one child at a time and take the child right through school ,COMMA sent to college ,COMMA and get them prepared for better living ,COMMA a high value job .PERIOD 
that was our first school .PERIOD one hundred sixty-five children .PERIOD 
but they know there is this myth that children from the slums cannot speak english well .PERIOD 
even if it takes me four and a half hours ,COMMA or three and half hours to finish my book ,COMMA i do it .PERIOD 
we have to send the fathers to de-addiction labs and when they come back ,COMMA most times sober ,COMMA we have to find a job for them so that they don't regress .PERIOD 
art ,COMMA music are considered therapy and mediums of expression .PERIOD 
we didn't hire mckinsey to do a business plan .PERIOD 
he comes for a tummy rub ,COMMA because he believes that will give me luck .PERIOD 
i promise you ,COMMA parusharam will speak in the ted conference a few years from now .PERIOD 
i think i was supposed to talk about my new book ,COMMA which is called blink ,COMMA and it's about snap judgments and first impressions .PERIOD 
so i decided instead ,COMMA i would talk about someone who i think has done as much to make americans happy as perhaps anyone over the last <NUM> years ,COMMA a man who is a great personal hero of mine :COLON someone by the name of howard moskowitz ,COMMA who is most famous for reinventing spaghetti sauce .PERIOD

we'd like you to figure out how much aspartame we should put in each can of diet pepsi ,COMMA in order to have the perfect drink .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK 
and he would think it through and say ,COMMA what was wrong ?QUESTIONMARK 
why could we not make sense of this experiment with diet pepsi ?QUESTIONMARK 
this was his horseradish .PERIOD he was obsessed with it !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
you'd have a plate of spaghetti ,COMMA and you would pour it on ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
and of those three facts ,COMMA the third one was the most significant ,COMMA because at the time ,COMMA in the early <NUM> ,COMMA if you went to a supermarket ,COMMA you would not find extra-chunky spaghetti sauce .PERIOD 
and prego turned to howard ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA you telling me that one third of americans crave extra-chunky spaghetti sauce and yet no one is servicing their needs ?QUESTIONMARK and he said yes !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
it's a mystery !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
what percentage of you actually like a dark ,COMMA rich ,COMMA hearty roast ?QUESTIONMARK 
a mustard of more sophistication and culture and meaning .PERIOD 
there is no perfect mustard or imperfect mustard .PERIOD 
and where did that come from ?QUESTIONMARK it came from italy .PERIOD 
when we talked about authentic tomato sauce in the <NUM> ,COMMA we talked about italian tomato sauce .PERIOD we talked about the earliest ragus ,COMMA which had no visible solids ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
because we thought that what it took to make people happy was to provide them with the most culturally authentic tomato sauce ,COMMA a ;SEMICOLON and b ,COMMA we thought that if we gave them the culturally authentic tomato sauce ,COMMA then they would embrace it .PERIOD 
i guess my cancer different from your cancer .PERIOD 
and for that ,COMMA we owe him a great vote of thanks .PERIOD 
and the example he used was coffee .PERIOD 
but to us he was just dad ,COMMA and our home life was pretty normal .PERIOD 
and i think a lot of people in his day probably thought he was a bit of a kook .PERIOD 
or even the people who actually pulled it off ,COMMA the people at bolt ,COMMA beranek and newman in boston ,COMMA who just would sketch out these structures of what would eventually become a worldwide network ,COMMA and sketching things on the back of napkins and on note papers and arguing over dinner at howard johnson's - on route <NUM> in lexington ,COMMA massachusetts ,COMMA just two miles from where i was studying the queen's gambit deferred and listening to gladys knight & amp ;SEMICOLON the pips singing midnight train to georgia ,COMMA while - - in my dad's big easy chair ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
another one which believes in the pure transparency of content .PERIOD 
these are four very different ways of looking at the world .PERIOD i even gave them names .PERIOD 
and there's also a balance between the visible and the invisible in comics .PERIOD 
this was even before the web .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA what they would do is ,COMMA they'd have these comic pages that resemble print comics pages ,COMMA and they would introduce all this sound and motion .PERIOD 
the distance from abraham lincoln to a lincoln penny ,COMMA the penny marshall to the marshall plan to plan <NUM> to nine lives :COLON it's all the same .PERIOD 
so i had all these notions .PERIOD this was back in the late <NUM> ,COMMA and other people in my business thought i was pretty crazy ,COMMA but a lot of people then went on and actually did it .PERIOD 
i just want to get to the last panel .PERIOD 
talk about your infinite canvas .PERIOD

and as great as these books were ,COMMA you could always tell that you were getting close to the full effect .PERIOD 
and that's when i discovered comedy .PERIOD 
it takes the base metal of our conventional wisdom and transforms it through ridicule into a different way of seeing and ultimately being in the world .PERIOD 
because that's what i take from the theme of this conference :COLON gained in translation .PERIOD 
now i'm big on speaking to people's self-interest because we're all wired for that .PERIOD 
now that's honesty and integrity ,COMMA and it's also why fey's performances left such a lasting impression .PERIOD 
now whether this says more about the conflict between integrity and profitability of corporate journalism than it does about the attentiveness of stewart's viewers ,COMMA the larger point remains that stewart's material is always grounded in a commitment to the facts - not because his intent is to inform .PERIOD it's not .PERIOD 
his intent is to be funny .PERIOD 
and just like that ,COMMA you've been seduced into a different way of looking at something because the endorphins have brought down your defenses .PERIOD 
because from what i can tell ,COMMA the three things gay americans seem to want most are to join the military ,COMMA get married and start a family .PERIOD 
economy of language is another real strong suit of great comedy .PERIOD 
how about that ?QUESTIONMARK how about we create a better world for nothing ?QUESTIONMARK 
and not long after that ,COMMA he got another request for a copy from the head of the epa in california who used it as part of her presentation at an international conference on climate change in sacramento last year .PERIOD

being serious is hard .PERIOD 
serious design ,COMMA serious play ,COMMA is something else .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i always saw design careers like surreal staircases .PERIOD

there's a paul newman movie that i love called the verdict .PERIOD

and that is a wonderful position to be in to create some serious play .PERIOD 
there was no format .PERIOD 
i lived and breathed it in a way i haven't with a client since .PERIOD 
it enabled me to really express myself and grow .PERIOD 
but something happened to it ,COMMA and what happened to it was ,COMMA it became very popular .PERIOD 
here's an ad in the new york times somebody did for a play called mind games .PERIOD 
i'd never done this kind of work before .PERIOD 
this is symphony space on <NUM> street and broadway ,COMMA and the type is interwoven into the stainless steel and backlit with fiber optics .PERIOD 
and it was serious play .PERIOD 
they got into it - they took the job incredibly seriously .PERIOD 
but it became the end of the seriousness of the play ,COMMA and it started to ,COMMA once again ,COMMA become solemn .PERIOD 
and then i spent a year going to long ,COMMA tedious ,COMMA boring meetings ,COMMA trying to sell this logo through to a huge corporation to the point of tears .PERIOD 
here's the united states .PERIOD 
and there are some brilliant linguists ,COMMA mostly russians ,COMMA who are working on that ,COMMA at santa fe institute and in moscow ,COMMA and i would love to see where that leads .PERIOD 
you may just know more about everything than anyone .PERIOD 
it was a big idea ,COMMA for sure ,COMMA and it was one that he felt could truly inform and deeply affect the decision making of this body through animations of global data ,COMMA trends and other information regarding the globe ,COMMA on this sphere .PERIOD 
we can use leds .PERIOD 
in addition to higher resolution versions of this display ,COMMA my father and i are working on a new patent-pending design for a fully volumetric display using the same phenomenon .PERIOD

that's nothing new :COLON that's a propeller clock ;SEMICOLON that's the rims that you can buy for your car .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA as we continue to tinker with the oceans ,COMMA more and more reports are predicting that the kinds of seas that we're creating will be conducive to low-energy type of animals ,COMMA like jellyfish and bacteria .PERIOD

they like to sunbathe ,COMMA can't blame them .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA you look at sharks ,COMMA and they're streamlined ,COMMA and they're sleek ,COMMA and you look at tuna ,COMMA and they're like torpedoes - they just give away their agenda .PERIOD they're about migration and strength ,COMMA and then you look at the sunfish .PERIOD 
and this is just so elegantly mysterious ,COMMA it's just - it really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than say ,COMMA a tuna .PERIOD 
and from that little egg ,COMMA they pass through this spiky little porcupine fish stage ,COMMA reminiscent of their ancestry ,COMMA and develop - this is their little adolescent stage .PERIOD 
that's a little diver up there in the corner .PERIOD 
how do you do that with an animal - very few places in the world .PERIOD

so what are we trying to find out ?QUESTIONMARK we're focusing on the pacific .PERIOD 
we're tagging on the california coast ,COMMA and we're tagging over in taiwan and japan .PERIOD 
not this time of year - it's more around october .PERIOD

and they'll put their fins out and their eyes go in the back of their head ,COMMA and the fish come up and they just clean ,COMMA clean ,COMMA clean - because the molas ,COMMA you know ,COMMA there's just a smorgasbord of parasites .PERIOD 
i'm going to show you our latest dataset .PERIOD 
and we found that they kind of are homebodies .PERIOD 
so that's a very important piece of data .PERIOD

now this is a very complicated struggle .PERIOD 
instead ,COMMA we prefer these really dazzling technological solutions ,COMMA which cost a huge amount of money .PERIOD 
but because they're a u.n. operation ,COMMA maybe that's why governments and corporations are not that interested in them .PERIOD 
because it's a u.n. operation ,COMMA of course ,COMMA it lacks funding .PERIOD 
cybercriminals would go there to buy and sell stolen credit card details ,COMMA to exchange information about new malware that was out there .PERIOD 
the purchaser would send the administrative officer some dollars digitally ,COMMA and the vendor would sell the stolen credit card details .PERIOD

i think to an extent ,COMMA you have to understand that it's axiomatic among hackers that they do that .PERIOD

whether you love suburbia's leafy privacy or you hate its soulless commercial strips ,COMMA there are reasons why it's important to retrofit .PERIOD

when metrorail expanded transit into the suburbs and opened a station nearby to this site ,COMMA the owners decided to build a new parking deck and then insert on top of their surface lots a new main street ,COMMA several apartments and condo buildings ,COMMA while keeping the existing office buildings .PERIOD 
so here's what it looks like .PERIOD 
you can sort of see the funky new condo buildings in between the office buildings and the public space and the new main street .PERIOD 
i think they really built an attractive place here and have just employed all-green construction .PERIOD 
but it's also not really enough to just create pockets of walkability .PERIOD 
so this is one that has been retrofitted in california .PERIOD 
so there's a lot of great things ,COMMA but i'd love to see more corridors getting retrofitting .PERIOD 
sometimes re-greening is really the better answer .PERIOD

but only two percent don't know the effect that the debacle in argentina will have on the imf's monetary policy - seems a contradiction .PERIOD 
so this subject-object thing ,COMMA is part of something i'm very interested in because this is why ,COMMA frankly ,COMMA i believe in political correctness .PERIOD 
maybe too far .PERIOD but you know - i don't think that a person of color making fun of white people is the same thing as a white person making fun of people of color .PERIOD 
there always had to be the butt of a joke .PERIOD

if you looked at glucose molecules till you were blind ,COMMA you wouldn ’ t see why they tasted sweet .PERIOD 
and it ’ s a good thing that there isn ’ t ,COMMA because if there were ,COMMA then mother nature would have a problem :COLON how on earth do you get chimps to mate ?QUESTIONMARK 
what we see with ,COMMA say ,COMMA chocolate cake is it ’ s a supernormal stimulus to tweak our design wiring .PERIOD 
you ’ ve got <NUM> seconds ,COMMA you ’ d better be fast .PERIOD 
yes ,COMMA lot ’ s of laughter .PERIOD yeah ,COMMA exactly .PERIOD 
so we might have a wild idea ,COMMA but we ’ re afraid to share it with anybody else .PERIOD 
they just quite happily show their masterpiece to whoever wants to look at it .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA that wasn ’ t just self-indulgence .PERIOD 
it takes more than decor ,COMMA but i think we ’ ve all seen that creative companies do often have symbols in the workplace that remind people to be playful ,COMMA and that it ’ s a permissive environment .PERIOD 
but why is it important ?QUESTIONMARK 
we use it in a pretty pragmatic way ,COMMA to be honest .PERIOD 
and you know ,COMMA the more creative of them might get to a really interesting example .PERIOD 
so another one of bob mckim ’ s favorite exercises is called the <NUM> circles test .PERIOD 
okay .PERIOD put down your pencils ,COMMA as they say .PERIOD 
<NUM> ?QUESTIONMARK <NUM> ?QUESTIONMARK anybody get all <NUM> ?QUESTIONMARK 
i just wanted you to fill in as many circles as possible .PERIOD 
we stop ourselves from doing things .PERIOD 
i think the eameses are wonderful examples of experimentation .PERIOD 
they went from designing splints for wounded soldiers coming out of world war ii and the korean war ,COMMA i think ,COMMA and from this experiment they moved on to chairs .PERIOD 
when play is about building a tower out of blocks ,COMMA the kid begins to learn a lot about towers .PERIOD 
and as they repeatedly knock it down and start again ,COMMA learning is happening as a sort of by-product of play .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA they learned their way to that by building prototypes .PERIOD 
and all of a sudden a productive conversation was happening about design around a tangible object .PERIOD 
the prototyping carts ,COMMA filled with colored paper and play-doh and glue sticks and stuff - i mean ,COMMA they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them .PERIOD 
but by giving project teams and the clients who they ’ re working with permission to think with their hands ,COMMA quite complex ideas can spring into life and go right through to execution much more easily .PERIOD 
we ’ re doing the same thing as designers .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA remember the sketching task we did at the beginning ?QUESTIONMARK 
as designers ,COMMA we need to be able to transition in and out of play also .PERIOD 
and it doesn't take long to go downhill .PERIOD 
and i got distracted by it .PERIOD 
and suddenly i was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent ,COMMA when i should have been talking to my clients .PERIOD 
my partner and i ,COMMA thom ,COMMA we had to let all our employees go .PERIOD 
because with no employees ,COMMA there was nobody for me to manage .PERIOD 
and i grew up in this little farming town in northern nevada .PERIOD 
britlin was so innocent and so sweet ,COMMA and her voice was so pure .PERIOD 
and i had this idea :COLON if i could get <NUM> people to all do this same thing ,COMMA sing their parts - soprano ,COMMA alto ,COMMA tenor and bass - wherever they were in the world ,COMMA post their videos to youtube ,COMMA we could cut it all together and create a virtual choir .PERIOD 
and i sent out this call to singers .PERIOD 
and i made free the download of the music to a piece that i had written in the year <NUM> called lux aurumque ,COMMA which means light and gold .PERIOD 
this is evangelina etienne from massachusetts .PERIOD 
i was told later ,COMMA and also by lots of singers who were involved in this ,COMMA that they sometimes recorded <NUM> or <NUM> different takes until they got just the right take - they uploaded it .PERIOD 
he scrubbed the audio .PERIOD 
and then we posted this video to youtube about a year and a half ago .PERIOD 
we had a million hits in the first month and got a lot of attention for it .PERIOD 
and there were <NUM> people involved in that .PERIOD 
and we also put a page on facebook for the singers to upload their testimonials ,COMMA what it was like for them ,COMMA their experience singing it .PERIOD 
my sister and i used to sing in choirs together constantly .PERIOD 
me too .PERIOD 
it is a dream come true to be part of this choir ,COMMA as i've never been part of one .PERIOD 
and the second is that people seem to be experiencing an actual connection .PERIOD 
it wasn't a virtual choir .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA i know myself too ,COMMA i feel this virtual esprit de corps ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA with all of them .PERIOD 
this is a recording i made of a mantis shrimp that's found off the coast of california .PERIOD 
and mantis shrimp are called mantis shrimp after the praying mantises ,COMMA which also have a fast feeding appendage .PERIOD and i started to think ,COMMA well ,COMMA maybe it will be interesting ,COMMA while listening to their sounds ,COMMA to figure out how these animals generate very fast feeding strikes .PERIOD 
so we got this incredible video system .PERIOD it's very new technology - it just came out about a year ago - that allows you to film at extremely high speeds in low light .PERIOD 
and as you'll notice ,COMMA it's still pretty gosh darn fast slowed down <NUM> times .PERIOD it's an incredibly powerful movement .PERIOD 
so what we calculated was that the limbs were moving at the peak speed ranging from <NUM> meters per second all the way up to <NUM> meters per second .PERIOD 
it takes a long time for the muscle to contract ,COMMA and a very short time for the limb to fly out .PERIOD 
there needs to be some kind of spring-loaded mechanism in order to generate the amount of force that we observe ,COMMA and the speed that we observe ,COMMA and the output of the system .PERIOD 
the saddle-shaped structure is also known as a hyperbolic paraboloid surface ,COMMA or an anticlastic surface .PERIOD 
in biological systems it's important not to have a whole lot of extra material requirements for building it .PERIOD 
and so this is just a regular video of the animal just smashing the heck out of this load cell .PERIOD 
and again ,COMMA i think this will be a world record .PERIOD 
and what i'd like you to do in this shot is keep your eye on this ,COMMA on the surface of the load cell ,COMMA as the limb comes flying through .PERIOD 
people have been struggling for years to try and design a very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn't cavitate and literally wear away the metal and put holes in it ,COMMA just like these pictures show .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA you might have even seen some cavitation going up the edge of the limb .PERIOD 
very ,COMMA very convenient solution to that particular problem .PERIOD 
and there's actually a spectacular colored dot in the center of the saddles of many species of stomatopods .PERIOD 
and this is quite interesting ,COMMA to find evolutionary origins of visual signals on what's really ,COMMA in all species ,COMMA their spring .PERIOD 
and so i'm very curious about whether those colored dots in the center of the saddles are conveying some kind of information about their ability to strike ,COMMA or their strike force ,COMMA and something about the time period in the molting cycle .PERIOD 
we still have one foot in the dark ages .PERIOD 
t.s .PERIOD eliot really said it for me - and this should give you goose bumps :COLON we shall not cease from exploration and the end of our exploring shall be to return where we started and know the place for the first time .PERIOD 
it ’ s a thin film ,COMMA two-dimensional existence .PERIOD 
and if you hefted those two things you might find that the relative scale of those is <NUM> to <NUM> .PERIOD 
it actually is a very good working sub - that ’ s what it was designed for .PERIOD 
a seat works in a two-dimensional world ,COMMA where gravity blasts down on that seat ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
most of life on earth is in that inner atmosphere .PERIOD 
this is a three-dimensional machine .PERIOD 
this is man ’ s first attempt at flying underwater .PERIOD 
chris asked us to show stuff that hasn ’ t been shown before .PERIOD 
i ’ m trying to do everything very gently .PERIOD 
this is the first flying machine .PERIOD this was the first prototype .PERIOD 
there ’ re no silly buoyancy tanks - it ’ s permanently ,COMMA positively buoyant .PERIOD 
she ’ s just a few inches off the top of my head .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA how i see my work contributing is sort of trying to literally re-imagine these connections and physically rebuild them .PERIOD 
so the era of big infrastructure is over .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA albeit a very small creature and very modest ,COMMA this creature is incredible ,COMMA because it can agglomerate into these mega-reef structures .PERIOD 
but you can see ,COMMA even just intuit ,COMMA from this map ,COMMA that the harbor has dredged and flattened ,COMMA and went from a rich ,COMMA three-dimensional mosaic to flat muck in really a matter of years .PERIOD 
now the gowanus is particularly smelly - i will admit it .PERIOD 
when we started this project ,COMMA one of the core ideas was to look back in history and try to understand what was there .PERIOD 
we also learned at this time that you could eat an oyster about the size of a dinner plate in the gowanus canal itself .PERIOD 
it accepts algae and detritus in one end ,COMMA and through this beautiful ,COMMA glamorous set of stomach organs ,COMMA out the other end comes cleaner water .PERIOD 
basically ,COMMA new york was built on the backs of oystermen ,COMMA and our streets were literally built over oyster shells .PERIOD 
what is fuzzy rope ,COMMA you ask ?QUESTIONMARK 
so we imagine that we would actually potentially even host a bake sale to start our new project .PERIOD 
so get your tevas on .PERIOD 
and then those spat are then seeded .PERIOD 
and also showing oyster gardening for the community along its edges .PERIOD 
and finally ,COMMA how much fun it would be to watch the flupsy parade and cheer on the oyster spats as they go down to the reef .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA sorry - it just feels like i should be doing stand-up up here because of the setting .PERIOD 
because if we get it out of the streets ,COMMA it'll smell much better ,COMMA and - oh right ,COMMA we drink from the river .PERIOD 
and he'd made the case in a number of papers and done a number of studies ,COMMA but nothing had really stuck .PERIOD 
you can't really see it in this map ,COMMA but this is the map that becomes the central focus in the second half of my book .PERIOD 
so it was this incredibly terrifying event .PERIOD 
just an extraordinary ,COMMA terrifying scene .PERIOD 
and eventually snow made a map of the outbreak .PERIOD 
and he thought about representing that as a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods ,COMMA people who hadn't ,COMMA you know ,COMMA percentages of people who hadn't ,COMMA but eventually he hit upon the idea that what he needed was something that you could see .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA with the help of this map ,COMMA and with the help of more evangelizing that he did over the next few years and that whitehead did ,COMMA eventually ,COMMA actually ,COMMA the authorities slowly started to come around .PERIOD 
we don't worry that new york city is going to collapse in on itself quite the way that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA rome did ,COMMA and be <NUM> percent of its size in <NUM> years or <NUM> years .PERIOD 
his whole monastery was thrown into prison at the time of the uprising ,COMMA when the dalai lama had to leave tibet .PERIOD 
and it just so happened ,COMMA on the fifth week ,COMMA there was a public teaching by the dalai lama .PERIOD 
i interview and do portraits .PERIOD 
so this is our icon to non-violence in our world - one of our living icons .PERIOD 
this is mengatoue .PERIOD 
he's the shaman of the huaorani ,COMMA and he said to us ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i'm an older man now ;SEMICOLON i'm getting tired ,COMMA you know ;SEMICOLON i'm tired of spearing these oil workers .PERIOD 
and this kid lived in the village - he wasn't there at the time - and this is the little movie he put together about that .PERIOD 
it's a question of what's the continuity ?QUESTIONMARK 
we draw this set of nested spheres cut away so you see it .PERIOD 
so if you take a picture of what's going on ,COMMA it's <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
and we go through a period of accelerating expansion ,COMMA and the universe expands and cools until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent ,COMMA then to the dark ages ,COMMA and then the first stars turn on ,COMMA and they evolve into galaxies ,COMMA and then later they get to the more expansive galaxies .PERIOD 
i always think of space-time as being the real substance of space ,COMMA and the galaxies and the stars just like the foam on the ocean .PERIOD 
and just put radially they're going out that way .PERIOD 
what happens is ,COMMA you take pictures as the earth rotates ,COMMA you get a fan across the sky .PERIOD 
do you see the fan-like scans made across the sky ?QUESTIONMARK 
so again ,COMMA you can see the extension of this great wall of galaxies showing up here .PERIOD 
and we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out right .PERIOD 
so i'll show you the next movie .PERIOD 
we're going to keep zooming in .PERIOD ok .PERIOD 
and so i forgot to tell you the scale .PERIOD 
so it takes light three billion years to travel over that distance .PERIOD 
there's a very simple fluid to begin with .PERIOD 
and so you know when you first saw this picture ,COMMA it didn't mean quite so much to you .PERIOD 
here you're looking across one percent of the volume of the visible universe and you're seeing billions of galaxies ,COMMA right ,COMMA and nodes ,COMMA but you realize they're not even the main structure .PERIOD 
and we're going to fly around ,COMMA and we'll fly around ,COMMA and you'll see occasionally a couple of filaments intersect ,COMMA and you get a large cluster of galaxies .PERIOD 
so the question is ,COMMA how hard would it be to assemble this ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
and so here we are .PERIOD 
this is how ,COMMA if you took billions of years to go around ,COMMA it might look to you ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
and if you could see invisible matter ,COMMA too .PERIOD 
we're going to start and realize that the entire visible universe ,COMMA everything we can see in every direction with the hubble space telescope plus our other instruments ,COMMA was once in a region that was smaller than an atom .PERIOD 
so i'm going to show you one that can be run on a desktop in two days in the next picture .PERIOD 
and at that point ,COMMA the universe mysteriously starts accelerating its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger-scale structure .PERIOD 
the fact is that we're living longer .PERIOD 
it really involves many different areas .PERIOD 
and that's where the field is today .PERIOD 
we then grow the cells outside the body ,COMMA take the scaffold ,COMMA coat the scaffold with the cells - the patient's own cells ,COMMA two different cell types .PERIOD 
so the strategy here is - this is actually a ct scan ,COMMA an x-ray - and we go layer by layer ,COMMA using computerized morphometric imaging analysis and <NUM> reconstruction to get right down to those patient's own kidneys .PERIOD 
and this is actually a new technology we're working on now .PERIOD 
i was able to do more things .PERIOD 
most of my professors were all for it ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA bring pictures and show me the clips online ,COMMA and i'm happy for you .PERIOD 
' i failed !EXCLAMATIONMARK' he cried .PERIOD 
one was - never be late .PERIOD never be late .PERIOD 
that's what he tried to teach me and my brothers at one time .PERIOD 
he spelled moriarty with only one' i' .PERIOD 
you and i know deeper down ,COMMA there's always a chance to win the crown .PERIOD 
giving all ,COMMA it seems to me ,COMMA is not so far from victory .PERIOD 
don't whine .PERIOD don't complain .PERIOD don't make excuses .PERIOD 
not necessary to what you would want them to be ,COMMA but they will be about what they should ,COMMA and only you will know whether you can do that .PERIOD 
i mention in my book ,COMMA they call me coach .PERIOD 
so they had qualities that - they came close to - as close to reaching possibly their full potential as any players i ever had .PERIOD 
so in other words ,COMMA what's happening here is that swaptree solves my carrying company's sugar rush problem ,COMMA a problem the economists call the coincidence of wants ,COMMA in approximately <NUM> seconds .PERIOD 
so what's happening here ?QUESTIONMARK 
we're bartering ,COMMA trading ,COMMA swapping ,COMMA sharing ,COMMA but they're being reinvented into dynamic and appealing forms .PERIOD 
over the next minute ,COMMA you're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display of all the dots that went on in my head .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA we're monkeys ,COMMA and we're born and bred to share and cooperate .PERIOD 
and we were doing so for thousands of years ,COMMA whether it's when we hunted in packs ,COMMA or farmed in cooperatives ,COMMA before this big system called hyper-consumption came along and we built these fences and created out own little fiefdoms .PERIOD 
they're growing up sharing - files ,COMMA video games ,COMMA knowledge .PERIOD 
thomas friedman is one of my favorite new york times columnists ,COMMA and he poignantly commented that <NUM> is when we hit a wall ,COMMA when mother nature and the market both said ,COMMA no more .PERIOD 
the second is collaborative lifestyles .PERIOD 
just think of libraries and laundrettes .PERIOD 
they are what i consider to be the cities of tomorrow ,COMMA the new urban world .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA why do i say that ?QUESTIONMARK 
after we finished ,COMMA armstrong straightened his tie ,COMMA put on a wool sports jacket ,COMMA and we headed out into the glare .PERIOD 
i thought they might be playing king of the hill ,COMMA but i was wrong .PERIOD 
'it's a simple life ,COMMA but nobody is restricting you .PERIOD 
beer is a very important thing in brazil .PERIOD 
this here ,COMMA on the right-hand side ,COMMA is what's called a - if you look at the fine print under the awning - it's a hotel .PERIOD 
and the second aspect is that once you have <NUM> people in the community ,COMMA you can petition the government to be recognized as a legal sub-municipality .PERIOD 
my family moved ;SEMICOLON we're nomads .PERIOD 
but these two people worked something out .PERIOD 
right now ,COMMA those and other neurologic diseases - for which we have no cure or prevention - cost about a third of a trillion dollars a year .PERIOD 
it will be well over a trillion dollars by <NUM> .PERIOD 
and the avian flu is also not a good idea .PERIOD 
you should also keep your blood pressure down ,COMMA because chronic high blood pressure is the biggest single risk factor for alzheimer ’ s disease .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA when it comes to cognitive effects ,COMMA use it or lose it applies ,COMMA so you want to stay mentally stimulated .PERIOD 
and one of the first things that i started to investigate was the history of the name of technology .PERIOD 
and obviously ,COMMA technology had existed before then ,COMMA but we weren't aware of it ,COMMA and so it was sort of an awakening of this force in our life .PERIOD 
and that's the very first use of the word .PERIOD 
even the hunter-gatherers used some elementary tools .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA climate change is not a new thing .PERIOD 
and flowers and plants are the same thing ,COMMA extended ,COMMA and technology is basically an extension of life .PERIOD 
and the energy density that we see in the greatest of anywhere in the universe is actually in a pc chip .PERIOD 
and there are things moving towards greater complexity ,COMMA moving towards greater diversity ,COMMA moving towards greater specialization ,COMMA sentience ,COMMA ubiquity and most important ,COMMA evolvability :COLON those very same things are also present in technology .PERIOD 
he could buy things that king henry ,COMMA in all his wealth ,COMMA could never buy .PERIOD 
and what i mean by that is that we find a new job for it .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA better ideas is really - always the response to technology that we don't like is basically ,COMMA better technology .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA every technology is sort of a creative force looking for the right job .PERIOD 
and we are aware of the price .PERIOD 
great movement that is starting billions of years ago is moving through us and it continues to go ,COMMA and our choice ,COMMA so to speak ,COMMA in technology ,COMMA is really to align ourselves with this force much greater than ourselves .PERIOD 
i really appreciate your attention today .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD 
neil and i were sitting there comparing how little we've slept in anticipation for this .PERIOD i've never been so nervous - and i do this when i'm nervous ,COMMA i just realized .PERIOD 
in the brooklyn neighborhood that i lived in ,COMMA park slope ,COMMA there are a lot of writers - it's like a very high per capita ratio of writers to normal people .PERIOD 
so when i moved back to san francisco ,COMMA we rented this building .PERIOD 
so we thought ,COMMA we'll have all these writers and editors and everybody - sort of a writing community - coming into the office every day anyway ,COMMA why don't we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school ,COMMA get extra help on their written homework ,COMMA so you have basically no border between these two communities ?QUESTIONMARK 
and we looked around and somebody else said ,COMMA well ,COMMA you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer .PERIOD 
this is replacement eyes in case you lose one .PERIOD 
while you're reading the sign ,COMMA we pull a rope behind the counter and eight mop heads drop on your head .PERIOD 
it became mop heads .PERIOD and this is the fish theater ,COMMA which is just a saltwater tank with three seats ,COMMA and then right behind it we set up this space ,COMMA which was the tutoring center .PERIOD 
and we thought ,COMMA oh ,COMMA they're going to storm the gates ,COMMA they're gon na love it .PERIOD and they didn't .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA it's been proven that <NUM> to <NUM> hours a year with one-on-one attention ,COMMA a student can get one grade level higher .PERIOD 
but there was something psychological happening there that was just a little bit different .PERIOD 
they're allowed to go home at <NUM> p.m. enjoy their family ,COMMA enjoy other hobbies ,COMMA get outside ,COMMA play .PERIOD 
then we said ,COMMA well ,COMMA what are we going to do with the space during the day ,COMMA because it has to be used before <NUM> p.m .PERIOD 
so this is one of the books that they do .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA meanwhile ,COMMA there's an adult in the back typing this up ,COMMA taking it completely seriously ,COMMA which blows their mind .PERIOD 
it's right off the library .PERIOD and there we serve all <NUM> kids in this middle school .PERIOD 
you can see amy tan sponsored the next one ,COMMA i might get somewhere .PERIOD 
we sell all the student books .PERIOD 
they would say ,COMMA what is this ?QUESTIONMARK 
so the store actually did really well .PERIOD 
this is sam potts' great design that did this .PERIOD 
this is a little vault - you have to put your product in there ,COMMA it goes up an electric lift and then the guy behind the counter tells you that you have to recite the vow of heroism ,COMMA which you do ,COMMA if you want to buy anything .PERIOD and it limits ,COMMA really ,COMMA their sales .PERIOD 
so then ,COMMA the secret door - this is one of the shelves you don't see when you walk in ,COMMA but it slowly opens .PERIOD 
this is one of the students ,COMMA khaled hamdan .PERIOD 
came in .PERIOD got this concentrated attention .PERIOD 
i'm going to switch to we ,COMMA and not i ,COMMA hope :COLON we hope that the attendees of this conference will usher in a new era of participation in our public schools .PERIOD 
we hope that you will take the lead in partnering your innovative spirit and expertise with that of innovative educators in your community .PERIOD 
hot studio did a great job in a very tight deadline .PERIOD so ,COMMA visit the site .PERIOD 
i've been a priest in the church for <NUM> years .PERIOD 
do we really believe that god is the kind of male boss that we've been presenting in our worship and in our liturgies over all these years ?QUESTIONMARK 
suggesting that god expresses himself or herself through powerlessness ,COMMA rather than power .PERIOD 
acknowledging that god is unknown and unknowable by definition .PERIOD 
and this is what i said .PERIOD 
and we want an explanation from god .PERIOD 
for hundreds of years ,COMMA the prevailing orthodoxy ,COMMA the accepted truth ,COMMA was that god the father ,COMMA the creator ,COMMA is unchanging and therefore by definition cannot feel pain or sadness .PERIOD 
and the devastating events of the <NUM> century have forced people to question the cold ,COMMA unfeeling god .PERIOD 
who is god in all this ?QUESTIONMARK 
do we have a local god who can do little things like parking spaces ,COMMA but not big things like <NUM> mile-per-hour waves ?QUESTIONMARK 
that's just not acceptable to intelligent christians ,COMMA and we must acknowledge it .PERIOD 
you probably heard some of them :COLON the man who surfed the wave ,COMMA the teenage girl who recognized the danger because she had just been learning about tsunamis at school .PERIOD 
if we believe something like this ,COMMA we must let go of the puppet-master completely ,COMMA take our leave of the almighty controller ,COMMA abandon traditional models .PERIOD 
maybe god isn't an agent like all of us are agents .PERIOD 
the people knew their god by his mighty acts .PERIOD 
in the incredible intricacy and magnificence of the natural world .PERIOD 
in the end ,COMMA we have to say ,COMMA i don't know .PERIOD 
to have faith in this god would be more like trusting an essential benevolence in the universe ,COMMA and less like believing a system of doctrinal statements .PERIOD 
and how would one deepen such a faith ?QUESTIONMARK 
but in the end ,COMMA the only thing i could say for sure was ,COMMA i don't know ,COMMA and that just might be the most profoundly religious statement of all .PERIOD 
it was deep at night .PERIOD 
and i kept on staring at it until it disappeared .PERIOD 
this is not a story of a nameless survivor of war ,COMMA and nameless refugees ,COMMA whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers and our tv with tattered clothes ,COMMA dirty face ,COMMA scared eyes .PERIOD 
war ,COMMA a friend of mine said ,COMMA is not about sound at all .PERIOD 
it is actually about silence ,COMMA the silence of humanity .PERIOD 
i have since left iraq and founded a group called women for women international that ends up working with women survivors of wars .PERIOD 
she said ,COMMA but it's not fair ,COMMA because there is only one life ,COMMA and there should only be one death .PERIOD 
ninety percent of modern war casualties are civilians .PERIOD 
how interesting .PERIOD 
there is a side that is led by men ,COMMA and there is a side that is led by women .PERIOD 
there is no way we can talk about the building of stability if we don't start investing in women and girls .PERIOD 
she got into women for women international's program .PERIOD 
to start with ,COMMA these women that i told you about are dancing and singing every single day ,COMMA and if they can ,COMMA who are we not to dance ?QUESTIONMARK 
by accepting this dichotomy ,COMMA whether it's tongue-in-cheek ,COMMA when we attempt to accommodate it in our world ,COMMA and we try to build our foundation for the world ,COMMA we're messing up the future ,COMMA because ,COMMA who wants to be uncreative ?QUESTIONMARK 
now i grew up in the <NUM> and i'll admit it ,COMMA actually ,COMMA my childhood spanned the <NUM> ,COMMA and i was a wannabe hippie and i always resented the fact that i wasn't really old enough to be a hippie .PERIOD 
and i know there are people here ,COMMA the younger generation who want to be hippies ,COMMA but people talk about the <NUM> all the time ,COMMA and they talk about the anarchy that was there ,COMMA but when i think about the <NUM> ,COMMA what i took away from it was that there was hope for the future .PERIOD 
you see ,COMMA i always assumed i would go into space ,COMMA because i followed all of this ,COMMA but i also loved the arts and sciences .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA my mother helped me figure that one out .PERIOD 
but when i went into space ,COMMA when i went into space i carried a number of things up with me .PERIOD i carried a poster by alvin ailey ,COMMA which you can figure out now ,COMMA i love the dance company .PERIOD 
and yeah ,COMMA sub-atomic physics is deconstructive .PERIOD you literally try to tear atoms apart to understand what's inside of them .PERIOD but sculpture ,COMMA from what i understand from great sculptors ,COMMA is deconstructive ,COMMA because you see a piece and you remove what doesn't need to be there .PERIOD 
it's the universe ,COMMA as experienced by everyone ,COMMA and the arts manifest our desire ,COMMA our attempt to share or influence others through experiences that are peculiar to us as individuals .PERIOD 
do you know these books ,COMMA these such and such for dummies ?QUESTIONMARK 
but i was looking online at amazon.com for other books like this .PERIOD 
there's a sort of business model around being stupid in some sense .PERIOD 
i was in milan last week ,COMMA for the italian launch .PERIOD 
so it was traumatizing ,COMMA actually .PERIOD 
modernism means white box ,COMMA and it's a perfect white box .PERIOD 
i have a default title as a father of a bunch of daughters .PERIOD 
as a child ,COMMA we used to wake up at <NUM> a.m. and work till <NUM> p.m. six days a week .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
but the media lab is an interesting place ,COMMA and it's important to me because as a student ,COMMA i was a computer science undergrad ,COMMA and i discovered design later on in my life .PERIOD 
and there was this person ,COMMA muriel cooper .PERIOD 
it was the best advice i ever got .PERIOD so i went to art school ,COMMA because of her .PERIOD 
i think that the mentors that we all meet sort of humanize us .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA if you sort of compare that ,COMMA like this ,COMMA you'll see that computer versus human - i've been tracking this for the last year - computer versus human over the last year has changed .PERIOD 
i spent my entire early career making complex stuff .PERIOD 
lots of complex stuff .PERIOD 
this is a floral theme calendar in <NUM> ,COMMA and this is a firework calendar .PERIOD so ,COMMA you launch the number into space ,COMMA because the japanese believe that when you see fireworks ,COMMA you're cooler for some reason .PERIOD 
i've been lucky to have been there before people made these kind of things ,COMMA and so i made all this kind of stuff that messes with your eyes .PERIOD 
and eye meat is something different ,COMMA something more fibrous ,COMMA something more powerful ,COMMA perhaps .PERIOD but what could that be ,COMMA eye meat ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA i went back to the computer ,COMMA and i bought five large fries ,COMMA and scanned them all .PERIOD and i was looking for some kind of food theme ,COMMA and i wrote some software to automatically lay out french-fry images .PERIOD 
and also ,COMMA as a child ,COMMA i was the fattest kid in class ,COMMA so i used to love cheetos .PERIOD oh ,COMMA i love cheetos ,COMMA yummy .PERIOD 
i discovered that cheetos are good ,COMMA expressive material .PERIOD 
it's a strange business model .PERIOD i can come into work everyday and staple five pieces of paper and just stare at it with my latte .PERIOD 
in japan ,COMMA they say that sushi is challenging .PERIOD 
this book i wrote because i want to figure out life .PERIOD 
he's an expert in aging .PERIOD this horizontal axis is how old you are - twelve years old ,COMMA twenty-four years old ,COMMA seventy-four ,COMMA ninety-six years old - and this is some medical data .PERIOD so ,COMMA brain strength increases up to <NUM> ,COMMA and then after <NUM> ,COMMA it sort of goes down .PERIOD kind of depressing in a way .PERIOD 
your social responsibility is very interesting .PERIOD 
how dare we be optimistic ?QUESTIONMARK 
but ,COMMA as important as it is to change the lightbulbs ,COMMA it is more important to change the laws .PERIOD 
and there are lots of those .PERIOD but the climate crisis is the rare but all-important global ,COMMA or strategic ,COMMA conflict .PERIOD 
greenland remains .PERIOD twenty-eight years ago ,COMMA this is what the polar ice cap - the north polar ice cap - looked like at the end of the summer ,COMMA at the fall equinox .PERIOD 
this last fall ,COMMA i went to the snow and ice data center in boulder ,COMMA colorado ,COMMA and talked to the researchers here in monterey at the naval postgraduate laboratory .PERIOD 
the north polar ice cap is the same size geographically - doesn't look quite the same size - but it is exactly the same size as the united states ,COMMA minus an area roughly equal to the state of arizona .PERIOD 
they have exactly the same amount of carbon .PERIOD 
what is missing is a sense of urgency .PERIOD 
nbc - i'll show all of the networks here - the top journalists for nbc asked <NUM> questions in <NUM> of the presidential candidates :COLON two of them were about the climate crisis .PERIOD abc :COLON <NUM> questions ,COMMA two about the climate crisis .PERIOD 
this is gasoline consumption in all of these countries .PERIOD and us .PERIOD 
we have the technologies .PERIOD 
we have to have a unified view of how to go about this :COLON the struggle against poverty in the world and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions ,COMMA all has a single ,COMMA very simple solution .PERIOD 
but responses can actually make a huge difference in the poor countries .PERIOD this is a proposal that has been talked about a lot in europe .PERIOD 
lot of other things contributed to it ,COMMA but the new prime minister announced that his very first priority would be to change australia's position on kyoto ,COMMA and he has .PERIOD now ,COMMA they came to an awareness partly because of the horrible drought that they have had .PERIOD 
but we have a planetary emergency .PERIOD 
if we had just one week's worth of what we spend on the iraq war ,COMMA we could be well on the way to solving this challenge .PERIOD 
this challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization .PERIOD 
demand - change the light bulbs ,COMMA but change the laws .PERIOD change the global treaties .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA nobody is talking on that scale .PERIOD but i do believe that between now and november ,COMMA it is possible .PERIOD 
in terms of your own personal role going forward ,COMMA al ,COMMA is there something more than that you would like to be doing ?QUESTIONMARK 
al gore ,COMMA thank you so much for coming to ted .PERIOD 
and that's certainly how it seemed to me when i started this project .PERIOD 
all this noise around us actually has information .PERIOD 
so what i started thinking was ,COMMA perhaps there is something like open source intelligence here .PERIOD 
so we started doing this .PERIOD and you can see here on the horizontal axis you've got the number of people killed in an attack or the size of the attack .PERIOD 
you take all of the conflict ,COMMA all of the chaos ,COMMA all of the noise ,COMMA and out of that comes this precise mathematical distribution of the way attacks are ordered in this conflict .PERIOD 
and we found that not only were the distributions these straight lines ,COMMA but the slope of these lines ,COMMA they clustered around this value of alpha equals <NUM> .PERIOD 
and we could generate an equation that could predict the likelihood of an attack .PERIOD 
this is data ,COMMA statistics .PERIOD what does it tell us about these conflicts ?QUESTIONMARK 
turns out we kind of do a reasonable job .PERIOD 
so what's going on ?QUESTIONMARK 
why should these different - seemingly different conflicts have the same patterns ?QUESTIONMARK 
what does it look like ?QUESTIONMARK 
we can push it up :COLON the forces become more fragmented ;SEMICOLON there is more of them ,COMMA but they are weaker .PERIOD 
the opposite happened .PERIOD 
the groups became stronger .PERIOD 
but designers are great at taking big revolutions that happen and transforming them so that we can use them .PERIOD 
you work over different time zones ,COMMA you talk to very different people ,COMMA you multitask .PERIOD we all know it ,COMMA and we do it kind of automatically .PERIOD 
and all of a sudden scientists are seeking designers ,COMMA just like designers are seeking scientists .PERIOD 
and keith has come ,COMMA and also jonathan has come and many others .PERIOD 
and it was great ,COMMA because at the beginning was this apology fest - you know ,COMMA scientists would tell designers ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i don't know what style is ,COMMA i'm not really elegant .PERIOD 
i'm showing to you different sections of the show right now ,COMMA just to give you a taste of it .PERIOD 
in this case i'm showing more the designers' work ,COMMA because they're the ones that have really been stimulated .PERIOD 
but the problem is that it's a really ugly patty .PERIOD 
when you don't have to kill cows and it can have any shape ,COMMA what should it be like ?QUESTIONMARK 
one of the most important topics of the show - you know ,COMMA as anything in our life today ,COMMA we can look at it from many ,COMMA many different viewpoints ,COMMA and at different levels .PERIOD 
one of the most interesting and most important concepts is the idea of scale .PERIOD we change scale very often :COLON we change resolution of screens ,COMMA and we're not really fazed by it ,COMMA we do it very comfortably .PERIOD 
you can be in the subway and you can be completely isolated and have your own room in your ipod .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA this communal sense of experience that seems to be so important today .PERIOD 
and so this student at the rca designed this beautiful blown-glass object where the bees move from one chamber to the other if they detect that particular smell that signifies ,COMMA in this case ,COMMA pregnancy .PERIOD 
design for debate is a very interesting new endeavor that designers have really shaped for themselves .PERIOD 
and usually they are accompanied by videos .PERIOD 
it's quite amazing how these things can make you smile ,COMMA can make you laugh ,COMMA can make you cry sometimes .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
the only trouble is the people next door ;SEMICOLON i can't stand them .PERIOD 
and yet ,COMMA if i just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings ,COMMA i wouldn't be doing my job - because i have to actually be there for them and make sure that rituals happen ,COMMA that practicalities are seen to .PERIOD 
who cannot be touched by compassion when we see the terrible horrors of the results of war ,COMMA or famine ,COMMA or earthquakes ,COMMA or tsunamis ?QUESTIONMARK 
and ,COMMA of course ,COMMA you can't do that unless you understand yourself a bit more .PERIOD 
therefore ,COMMA there should be justice throughout the world .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA like snoopy ,COMMA we can't just lie there and think great thoughts about our neighbors .PERIOD 
there has to be a willingness to do good deeds ,COMMA but not ,COMMA of course ,COMMA at the expense of our own sanity .PERIOD 
what does this compassion entail ?QUESTIONMARK 
and ,COMMA as many people do ,COMMA he was dozing off during the sermon .PERIOD 
and he rushed home .PERIOD and after the sabbath ,COMMA he made <NUM> loaves of bread ,COMMA took them to the synagogue ,COMMA went into the synagogue ,COMMA opened the ark and said ,COMMA god ,COMMA i don't know why you want this bread ,COMMA but here you are .PERIOD 
and he called the two of them to his office .PERIOD 
you mean god didn't want my bread ?QUESTIONMARK 
and the rabbi said ,COMMA you've misunderstood me .PERIOD 
you've misunderstood totally ,COMMA he said .PERIOD 
please keep your seat .PERIOD 
wrap it in an ace bandage ,COMMA take some ibuprofen for a week or two ,COMMA and that's the end of the story .PERIOD 
how can the nervous system get this so wrong ?QUESTIONMARK 
in your house ,COMMA wires run in the wall ,COMMA from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling and from the junction box to the light bulb .PERIOD 
it's almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your walls so that the next time you turned on the light switch ,COMMA the toilet flushed three doors down ,COMMA or your dishwasher went on ,COMMA or your computer monitor turned off .PERIOD 
if you look out your window and you can see long's peak ,COMMA you're probably familiar with it .PERIOD 
take meeker ,COMMA mt .PERIOD meeker .PERIOD lump that in there ,COMMA and put that in space as well ,COMMA and mt .PERIOD everest ,COMMA and <NUM> ,COMMA and the indian peaks .PERIOD 
because back then ,COMMA video cameras were just starting to become popular ,COMMA and people would bring them ,COMMA parents would bring them ,COMMA to their kids' football games to film their kids play football .PERIOD and since this came in on a friday ,COMMA they were able to get this great footage of this thing breaking up as it came in over west virgina ,COMMA maryland ,COMMA pennsylvania and new jersey until it did that to a car in new york .PERIOD 
this did a huge amount of damage .PERIOD 
the one over tunguska was probably made of rock ,COMMA and that's much more crumbly ,COMMA so it blew up in the air .PERIOD either way ,COMMA these are tremendous explosions ,COMMA <NUM> megatons .PERIOD 
i don't think apophis is a problem .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA apophis is a blessing in disguise ,COMMA because it woke us up to the dangers of these things .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA let me ask you ,COMMA what happens if you're standing in the middle of the road and a car's headed for you ?QUESTIONMARK what do you do ?QUESTIONMARK you do this .PERIOD 
i think even nasa can do that ,COMMA and they proved that they can .PERIOD 
after the big macho rrrrrrr bam !EXCLAMATIONMARK we're gon na hit this thing in the face ,COMMA then we bring in the velvet gloves .PERIOD 
there's a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts and they call themselves the <NUM> foundation .PERIOD for those of you who've read the little prince ,COMMA you understand that reference ,COMMA i hope .PERIOD the little prince who lived on an asteroid ,COMMA it was called <NUM> .PERIOD 
so think about this ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
now those of you who are lucky enough to live in those societies that represent <NUM> percent ,COMMA i think should enjoy it until it lasts .PERIOD 
my story starts - the story i want to share - starts in <NUM> .PERIOD 
the problem was that we had to re-tape that history a week later ;SEMICOLON because if we did not ,COMMA we could not afford enough tapes to keep archives of that history .PERIOD 
so here we are having our first client ,COMMA brilliant .PERIOD 
it's a kind of very nice ,COMMA sophisticated way how to economically strangle a daily newspaper .PERIOD 
and we said ,COMMA that's fine ;SEMICOLON let's meet ;SEMICOLON you'll bring us your business plan ,COMMA which eventually they did .PERIOD 
we start the meeting .PERIOD 
but however you put it ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the numbers do not make any sense .PERIOD 
we were the best that they could do .PERIOD 
we do it in <NUM> countries of the developing world .PERIOD 
so what the governor got was an empty shell .PERIOD 
so from that perspective ,COMMA what we did is just really one drop in the sea of that need that we can identify .PERIOD 
imagine two thirds over here running excellent organizations ,COMMA doing very important work .PERIOD 
now imagine that every second person over here is deaf ,COMMA does not hear ,COMMA and switch the lights off .PERIOD 
so we thought that some kind of a big idea is needed to reform ,COMMA to totally rethink fundraising .PERIOD 
and then two weeks later ,COMMA iqbal quadir can issue his electricity in bangladesh bonds .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA indeed ,COMMA i have spent my life looking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive .PERIOD 
so since i tell stories ,COMMA let me look back on the lives of two of the presidents i've studied to illustrate this point - abraham lincoln and lyndon johnson .PERIOD 
but he read books in every spare moment he could find .PERIOD 
three things had combined to lay him low .PERIOD 
he was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal .PERIOD 
and his great friend speed went to his side and said ,COMMA lincoln ,COMMA you must rally or you will die .PERIOD 
and with a beauty of language - almost as if the shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child had worked their way into his very soul .PERIOD 
knowing that tolstoy was in their midst ,COMMA they asked him to tell stories of the great men of history .PERIOD 
but instead ,COMMA surprisingly ,COMMA he said ,COMMA oh ,COMMA bring her down here for a year ,COMMA and if i can't win her over ,COMMA no one can .PERIOD 
but they were great ,COMMA nonetheless .PERIOD 
but i also worried that part of it was that i was then a young woman .PERIOD 
and there was wine and cheese and a red-checked tablecloth - all the romantic trappings .PERIOD 
and the british people were still upset about losing the revolution ,COMMA so they decided to embarrass him a little bit by putting a huge picture of general washington in the only outhouse ,COMMA where he'd have to encounter it .PERIOD 
which allows me ,COMMA from the beginning of spring training to the end of the fall ,COMMA to have something to occupy my mind and heart other than my work .PERIOD 
but it so happened he was speaking in a protestant church .PERIOD 
so i went to my father in tears ,COMMA what are we going to do ?QUESTIONMARK 
i tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church ,COMMA wishing harm to others ,COMMA being mean to my sisters .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA here's an example from my own experience .PERIOD 
there are lots of people who believe that ,COMMA and i think it is utter baloney .PERIOD 
i think that's the main point to be made .PERIOD 
and i won't go into a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics and what it's like ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD 
there are even movies about it with a lot of wrong stuff .PERIOD 
and in a lot of familiar cases ,COMMA they of course are .PERIOD 
so it's not a theory of everything .PERIOD and in fact ,COMMA a huge amount of the information in the universe around us comes from those accidents ,COMMA and not just from the fundamental laws .PERIOD 
you know what it means .PERIOD a circle ,COMMA for example ,COMMA is symmetric under rotations about the center of the circle .PERIOD 
maxwell's equations are of course symmetrical under rotations of all of space .PERIOD 
the next - second - equation says that there is no magnetism other than that .PERIOD 
so here we say ,COMMA again ,COMMA what we said before :COLON that each skin of the onion shows a similarity to the adjoining skins .PERIOD 
and therefore it looks beautiful because we already know how to write it in a lovely ,COMMA concise way .PERIOD 
steps toward unification exhibit the simplicity .PERIOD 
symmetry exhibits the simplicity .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA who today would claim that as a mere conceit of the human mind ?QUESTIONMARK 
they are what we call emergent properties .PERIOD 
you don't need - you don't need something more to get something more .PERIOD 
life can emerge from physics and chemistry ,COMMA plus a lot of accidents .PERIOD 
the things we make have one supreme quality - they live longer than us .PERIOD 
we perish ,COMMA they survive ;SEMICOLON we have one life ,COMMA they have many lives ,COMMA and in each life they can mean different things .PERIOD 
the central element ,COMMA still ,COMMA of the notion of return ,COMMA a central part of the life of judaism .PERIOD 
all of those are respected by cyrus .PERIOD 
it left a dream of the middle east as a unit ,COMMA and a unit where people of different faiths could live together .PERIOD 
for them ,COMMA of course ,COMMA it can't possibly by marduk that made all this happen .PERIOD 
and it's quite clear the cylinder is older than the text of isaiah ,COMMA and yet ,COMMA jehovah is speaking in words very similar to those used by marduk .PERIOD 
the state of israel is setup ,COMMA and <NUM> years later ,COMMA in the late <NUM> ,COMMA it's clear that britain's role as the imperial power is over .PERIOD 
it's shown being presented here ,COMMA put into its case by the director of the national museum of tehran ,COMMA one of the many women in iran in very senior positions ,COMMA mrs. ardakani .PERIOD 
and it's the subject of a huge debate about what this cylinder means ,COMMA what cyrus means ,COMMA but above all ,COMMA cyrus as articulated through this cylinder - cyrus as the defender of the homeland ,COMMA the champion ,COMMA of course ,COMMA of iranian identity and of the iranian peoples ,COMMA tolerant of all faiths .PERIOD 
will iran set free the people that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated ?QUESTIONMARK 
a replica of this is at the united nations .PERIOD 
but i think it's possible that the most powerful and the wisest voice of all of them may well be the voice of this mute thing ,COMMA the cyrus cylinder .PERIOD 
making sense of those things is a very difficult thing to do .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA i have got qualifications .PERIOD 
so i started thinking about peace ,COMMA and i was obviously ,COMMA as i said to you ,COMMA very much moved by these images ,COMMA trying to make sense of that .PERIOD 
could i go and speak to older and wiser people who would tell me how they made sense of the things that are going on ?QUESTIONMARK 
and that was when i had the idea .PERIOD 
there was no day of global unity .PERIOD 
and that's why we wanted it to be the <NUM> of september as the date of peace .PERIOD 
could you give me a flight ?QUESTIONMARK because we're going to go see him .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA we went and saw him and it was amazing .PERIOD 
and just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing and really empowering actually .PERIOD 
and we were listening to everybody .PERIOD 
and working with ngos and building this case .PERIOD 
i felt that i was presenting a case on behalf of the global community to try and create this day .PERIOD 
and this young child who'd taken about an inch and a half out of her leg with no antiseptic ,COMMA and that young boy who was a child soldier ,COMMA who told me he'd killed people - he was about <NUM> - these things made me realize that this was not a film that i could just stop .PERIOD 
if this is the only film that i ever make ,COMMA i'm going to document until this becomes a reality .PERIOD 
the costa rican government and the british government had put forward to the united nations general assembly ,COMMA with <NUM> co-sponsors ,COMMA the idea of the first ever ceasefire nonviolence day ,COMMA the <NUM> of september ,COMMA as a fixed calendar date ,COMMA and it was unanimously adopted by every head of state in the world .PERIOD 
and as i mentioned ,COMMA when it started ,COMMA we were at the globe ,COMMA and there was no press .PERIOD 
it's been created ;SEMICOLON nobody knows .PERIOD 
but we have to continue this journey ,COMMA and we have to tell people ,COMMA and we have to prove it can work .PERIOD 
and after lots and lots of meetings obviously ,COMMA i'm delighted that this man ,COMMA ahmad fawzi ,COMMA one of my heroes and mentors really ,COMMA he managed to get unicef involved .PERIOD 
and i saw him because he was an actor ,COMMA i was an actor ,COMMA i had a connection to him ,COMMA because we needed to get to the press ,COMMA we needed this attraction ,COMMA we needed the media to be involved .PERIOD 
because if we start pumping it up a bit maybe more people would listen and there'd be more - when we got into certain areas ,COMMA maybe there would be more people interested .PERIOD 
i won't go into that .PERIOD 
so jude said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA i'll do some statements for you .PERIOD 
and i could sort of see a little look in his eye of interest .PERIOD 
so these guys were absolutely crucial .PERIOD 
this amazing woman ,COMMA fatima gailani ,COMMA was absolutely instrumental in what went on as she was the spokesperson for the resistance against the russians .PERIOD 
and her afghan network was just absolutely everywhere .PERIOD 
we will observe this day .PERIOD 
we see it as a window of opportunity .PERIOD 
and so then we wrapped the film up and we put it together because we had to go back .PERIOD 
and we wanted to go back and show them the film and say ,COMMA look ,COMMA you guys made this possible .PERIOD and thank you very much .PERIOD 
and i kept thinking about this <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
<NUM> percent reduction in violence - in what everyone said was completely impossible and you couldn't do .PERIOD 
he's an amazing man .PERIOD 
it's all about the individuals .PERIOD 
and it then made me think about a glass of water ,COMMA which is clear .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD 
there was not a flashlight ,COMMA not a lantern ,COMMA not a candle - pitch black .PERIOD 
anesthetic wears off .PERIOD the patient feels pain .PERIOD 
and her recommendation is take this opportunity to fire everyone ,COMMA start all over again .PERIOD 
now what does this have to do with leadership ?QUESTIONMARK 
they are the elite .PERIOD they are our leaders .PERIOD 
and we need to train them right .PERIOD 
and one day i go to the airport to meet my father ,COMMA and as i walk up this grassy slope from the car park to the terminal building ,COMMA i'm stopped by two soldiers wielding ak-47 assault weapons .PERIOD 
so a few years after this event ,COMMA i leave ghana on a scholarship to go to swarthmore college for my education .PERIOD 
they wanted us to be analytical .PERIOD 
they wanted us to be concerned about social issues .PERIOD 
it was brilliant .PERIOD 
somebody trained them to do the work that they do .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA we cannot achieve perfection ,COMMA but if we reach for it ,COMMA then we can achieve excellence .PERIOD 
i don't know ultimately what they will do .PERIOD 
but the conversation they're having now - about what their good society should look like ,COMMA what their excellent society should look like ,COMMA is a really good thing .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i just wanted to leave that slide up because it's important that we think about it .PERIOD 
i am even more thrilled by the fact that least year our student body elected a woman to be the head of student government .PERIOD 
it's the first time in the history of ghana that a woman has been elected head of student government at any university .PERIOD 
it says a lot about her peers who elected her .PERIOD 
my job is to make arms and legs - well it's not completely true .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA not only for war victims ,COMMA but it was for any kind of patient .PERIOD 
i was also working in the orthopedic center ,COMMA we call it .PERIOD 
but it was a terrific job .PERIOD 
so the orthopedic center was closed because physical rehabilitation was not considered a priority .PERIOD 
anyway ,COMMA you know every time i make this speech - it's not the first time - but it's an emotion .PERIOD 
i wanted to go home .PERIOD i was driving .PERIOD 
and everybody disappeared from the street .PERIOD 
the man was without legs and only with one arm .PERIOD 
and i ask ,COMMA what are you doing out in the street in this situation ?QUESTIONMARK 
and then i said ,COMMA oh ,COMMA my god .PERIOD what did i say ?QUESTIONMARK 
he was coming every day ,COMMA crossing the front line .PERIOD 
two groups of mujahideen started fighting .PERIOD 
so we dashed ,COMMA all of us ,COMMA towards the shelter .PERIOD 
everybody was grabbing something .PERIOD 
and i will never forget mahmoud and his son walking together pushing the empty wheelchair .PERIOD 
i don't want them to be teased at school by the other students .PERIOD 
i said ,COMMA okay .PERIOD 
and then he sat down .PERIOD 
so the only things i could manage to obtain was a kind of a compromise .PERIOD 
i understood that i was wrong again .PERIOD 
and then we started a new policy - a new policy completely different .PERIOD 
we decided to employ as many disabled as possible to train them in any possible job .PERIOD 
i said ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA we can't .PERIOD 
and you should see me during the match .PERIOD 
i shout like a true italian .PERIOD 
in this image of the tokyo skyline ,COMMA i've hidden data from the newest planet-hunting space telescope on the block ,COMMA the kepler mission .PERIOD 
there we go .PERIOD 
and we can measure this very ,COMMA very precisely with kepler and trace their effects .PERIOD 
wrong .PERIOD i'm not looking at you .PERIOD i can't see you .PERIOD 
i have to do something now ,COMMA which seems a little bit strange for a magician .PERIOD 
oh ,COMMA they gladly sell you that ,COMMA yes .PERIOD 
but the one thing that has made a big comeback just recently is this business of speaking with the dead .PERIOD 
i don't think so ,COMMA because this subculture of people use exactly the same gimmicks that we magicians do ,COMMA exactly the same - the same physical methods ,COMMA the same psychological methods - and they effectively and profoundly deceive millions of people around the earth ,COMMA to their detriment .PERIOD 
good bye .PERIOD 
the second question that i'd like to ask ,COMMA rather simple :COLON suppose i ask them to contact the spirit of my deceased father-in-law ,COMMA as an example .PERIOD 
is this a hunting game ?QUESTIONMARK 
but it is a cruel ,COMMA vicious ,COMMA absolutely conscienceless - i'll be all right ,COMMA keep your seats - game that these people play .PERIOD 
folks ,COMMA that's what dying is all about !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
now ,COMMA it may bring a certain amount of comfort ,COMMA but that comfort lasts only about <NUM> minutes or so .PERIOD 
we all know who he is on television .PERIOD 
he's well educated ,COMMA he's smart ,COMMA he knows what sylvia browne is doing but he doesn't give a damn .PERIOD 
because ,COMMA the bottom line is ,COMMA the sponsors love it ,COMMA and he will expose her to television publicity all the time .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA without that ,COMMA how could we possibly function ?QUESTIONMARK 
she gives you the names of previous lives ,COMMA who you were in previous lives .PERIOD 
duh .PERIOD 
nothing is ever said about a <NUM> year-old bootblack in the streets of london who died of consumption .PERIOD 
all the more reason to take the million dollars ,COMMA wouldn't you think ,COMMA sylvia ?QUESTIONMARK 
why don't they affect me ?QUESTIONMARK 
now folks ,COMMA this is not just a metaphor i'm going to give you now ,COMMA it's true .PERIOD 
and another claim that they make - you'll love this one - the more dilute the medicine is ,COMMA they say ,COMMA the more powerful it is .PERIOD 
largely ,COMMA it's the media who are to blame for this sort of thing .PERIOD 
it's the bottom line ,COMMA the dollar line .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA we've offered this carrot ,COMMA as i say ,COMMA we've dangled the carrot .PERIOD 
ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA i'm james randi ,COMMA and i'm waiting .PERIOD 
and one of the major gaps in care ,COMMA almost across the board ,COMMA is access to safe surgery .PERIOD 
in the background there is a very sophisticated anesthesia machine .PERIOD 
in order to operate ,COMMA this machine needs a number of things that this hospital has to offer .PERIOD 
and finally ,COMMA i think you can see that infrastructure is not very strong .PERIOD 
similarly compressed oxygen and other medical supplies are really a luxury and can often be out of stock for months or even a year .PERIOD 
one of our partners at johns hopkins was observing surgeries in sierra leone about a year ago .PERIOD 
and the first surgery of the day happened to be an obstetrical case .PERIOD 
and everything began pretty auspiciously .PERIOD 
my colleague ,COMMA dr. paul fenton ,COMMA was living this reality .PERIOD 
he went to work every day in an operating theater like this one ,COMMA trying to deliver anesthesia and teach others how to do so using that same equipment that became so unreliable ,COMMA and frankly unsafe ,COMMA in his hospital .PERIOD 
but this gives control to the provider ,COMMA whether there's power or not ,COMMA because they can adjust the flow based on the percentage of oxygen they see that they're giving their patient .PERIOD 
this is in <NUM> hospitals in four countries ,COMMA and since <NUM> ,COMMA we've done well over <NUM> surgeries with no clinically adverse events .PERIOD 
so we're thrilled .PERIOD 
because only once before has the fate of individual people and the fate of all of humanity been so intertwined .PERIOD 
maybe a few lung diseases here and there ,COMMA but ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that's not such a big deal .PERIOD 
but back to animals and junk food .PERIOD 
two :COLON both have been marketed heavily ,COMMA creating unnatural demand .PERIOD 
and they do this here .PERIOD it's the same deal .PERIOD 
that's just the united states .PERIOD 
there were no restaurant chains .PERIOD 
fats ,COMMA carbs ,COMMA proteins - they weren't bad or good ,COMMA they were food .PERIOD 
the south and west became agricultural hubs ,COMMA and in other parts of the country ,COMMA suburbs took over farmland .PERIOD 
if we had a slide of salisbury steak ,COMMA even more so ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
thanks to farm subsidies ,COMMA the fine collaboration between agribusiness and congress ,COMMA soy ,COMMA corn and cattle became king .PERIOD 
not that they were any good ,COMMA but they were there .PERIOD 
for dessert ,COMMA store-bought ice cream or cookies .PERIOD 
so now ,COMMA you've got your pizza nights ,COMMA you've got your microwave nights ,COMMA you've got your grazing nights ,COMMA you've got your fend-for-yourself nights and so on .PERIOD 
meat ,COMMA junk food ,COMMA cheese :COLON the very stuff that will kill you .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA now we clamor for organic food .PERIOD 
i don't know .PERIOD 
ann cooper's right .PERIOD 
the usda is not our ally here .PERIOD 
cruelty :COLON i knew that the <NUM> billion animals we raise each year for meat are raised in factory farm conditions that we ,COMMA hypocritically ,COMMA wouldn't even consider for our own cats ,COMMA dogs and other pets .PERIOD 
so why was i stalling ?QUESTIONMARK 
best of all ,COMMA i'm healthier ,COMMA i know that i'm going to live longer ,COMMA and i've even lost a little weight .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
some of these have already been touched upon by other speakers ,COMMA which is encouraging .PERIOD 
the first is - death is a big problem .PERIOD 
sometimes ,COMMA we don't see a problem because either it's too familiar or it's too big .PERIOD 
people like - it's roughly the population in this room has just died .PERIOD 
suppose we approximated one person with one book ?QUESTIONMARK 
so that's the first big problem .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA let's first look at the probability - and this is very ,COMMA very difficult to estimate - but there have been only four studies on this in recent years ,COMMA which is surprising .PERIOD 
he estimated a probability that we will fail to survive the current century :COLON <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
another author doesn't give any numerical estimate ,COMMA but says the probability is significant that it will fail .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA if we think about what just reducing the probability of human extinction by just one percentage point - not very much - so that's equivalent to <NUM> million lives saved ,COMMA if we just count the currently living people ,COMMA the current generation .PERIOD 
the only thing you should focus on would be to reduce existential risk because even the tiniest decrease in existential risk would just overwhelm any other benefit you could hope to achieve .PERIOD 
and even if you just look at the current people ,COMMA and ignore the potential that would be lost if we went extinct ,COMMA it should still have a high priority .PERIOD 
we were very successful .PERIOD 
we might end up with something like this ,COMMA which is - i mean ,COMMA it's a heck of a lot better than that .PERIOD 
and they also all seem a little bit - most people have this instinct that ,COMMA well ,COMMA sure ,COMMA there needs to be anti-depressants for the really depressed people .PERIOD 
intellectual capacity - let's take that box ,COMMA which falls into a lot of different sub-categories :COLON memory ,COMMA concentration ,COMMA mental energy ,COMMA intelligence ,COMMA empathy .PERIOD 
able to switch back and forth more easily would be a neat thing to be able to do - easier to achieve the flow state ,COMMA when you're totally immersed in something you are doing .PERIOD 
if you could actually choose to preserve your romantic attachments to one person ,COMMA undiminished through time ,COMMA so that wouldn't have to - love would never have to fade if you didn't want it to .PERIOD 
might be more complicated in humans ,COMMA but perhaps not that much .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA we know already that in this little human circle there ,COMMA there are these enormously wonderful and worthwhile modes of being - human life at its best is wonderful .PERIOD 
we have no reason to believe that within this much ,COMMA much larger space there would not also be extremely worthwhile modes of being ,COMMA perhaps ones that would be way beyond our wildest ability even to imagine or dream about .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA to fix this third problem ,COMMA i think we need - slowly ,COMMA carefully ,COMMA with ethical wisdom and constraint - develop the means that enable us to go out in this larger space and explore it and find the great values that might hide there .PERIOD 
the sun end was about four inches in diameter ,COMMA and then it tapered over about <NUM> feet to about a millimeter at the earth end .PERIOD 
so i got it down to just one tether to be able to support that .PERIOD 
so many forces there .PERIOD 
if i throw a very concentric circle ,COMMA or concentric ellipse ,COMMA it just dutifully makes these evenly spaced lines ,COMMA which get closer and closer together ,COMMA which describes how gravity works .PERIOD 
because since it has the ability to make forms that look like forms that we're familiar with in biology ,COMMA it's also making other forms that we're not familiar with .PERIOD 
oh ,COMMA let's hope so .PERIOD oh ,COMMA my god ,COMMA let's .PERIOD 
and i think nature wants to express itself in the sense that we are nature ,COMMA humans are of the universe .PERIOD 
and we are expressions of the universe ,COMMA basically .PERIOD 
as humans ,COMMA ultimately being part of the universe ,COMMA we're kind of the spokespeople or the observer part of the constituency of the universe .PERIOD 
and to interface with it ,COMMA with a device that lets these forces that are everywhere act and show what they can do ,COMMA giving them pigment and paint just like an artist ,COMMA it's a good ally .PERIOD 
it's become an art form ,COMMA a form of sculpture .PERIOD 
but even more importantly ,COMMA he created a language ,COMMA a way we could communicate ,COMMA a code of dots ,COMMA dashes and arrows .PERIOD 
this is an origami figure - one sheet ,COMMA no cuts ,COMMA folding only ,COMMA hundreds of folds .PERIOD 
this ,COMMA too ,COMMA is origami ,COMMA and this shows where we've gone in the modern world .PERIOD 
you can get horns ,COMMA antlers - even ,COMMA if you look close ,COMMA cloven hooves .PERIOD 
and what changed is something you might not have expected in an art ,COMMA which is math .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA a stag beetle - it's got two points for jaws ,COMMA it's got antennae .PERIOD can you be that specific in the detail ?QUESTIONMARK 
if i make the flaps skinnier ,COMMA i can use a bit less paper .PERIOD 
and i can use those patterns now to create origami shapes .PERIOD 
do a little more complicated instrument .PERIOD 
and he used it to design this solar array .PERIOD 
the telescope ,COMMA going up in space ,COMMA it unfolds in two places .PERIOD 
the design called for geosynchronous orbit <NUM> miles up ,COMMA 100-meter diameter lens .PERIOD 
and rockets are small .PERIOD so you have to make it smaller .PERIOD 
but this pattern's not going to work to get something <NUM> meters down to a few meters .PERIOD 
and they want to do their design by simulation .PERIOD 
and as weird and surprising as it may sound ,COMMA origami may someday even save a life .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA ecstasy in greek meant simply to stand to the side of something .PERIOD 
you can't understand more than two people talking to you .PERIOD 
and it has become a kind of a truism in the study of creativity that you can't be creating anything with less than <NUM> years of technical-knowledge immersion in a particular field .PERIOD 
whether it's mathematics or music ,COMMA it takes that long to be able to begin to change something in a way that it's better than what was there before .PERIOD 
you see that these people define success as something that helps others and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it .PERIOD 
the other combinations of challenge and skill become progressively less optimal .PERIOD 
and that is the kind of challenge that we're trying to understand .PERIOD 
not a lot of women did .PERIOD 
the <NUM> and the <NUM> also come to mind .PERIOD 
this is really just about the facts of this economic moment that we live in .PERIOD 
this second set of headlines - you can see that families and marriages are starting to shift .PERIOD 
and so they decided ,COMMA because they were intrigued by this finding ,COMMA to do a nationwide survey .PERIOD 
so they spread out all the census data ,COMMA and what they found ,COMMA the guy described to me as a shocker ,COMMA which is that in <NUM> out of <NUM> communities ,COMMA women ,COMMA young women ,COMMA were making more money than young men .PERIOD 
watch what happens to the women .PERIOD watch what happens to the men .PERIOD 
it looks like women got some power boost on a video game ,COMMA or like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth-control pills that lets them shoot up high .PERIOD 
what it's about is that the economy has changed a lot .PERIOD 
so that's childcare ,COMMA elder care and food preparation .PERIOD 
and some people say it's because ,COMMA in 9th grade ,COMMA boys start dropping out of school .PERIOD 
basically ,COMMA the way they said it to me is that they would be working <NUM> hours a day ,COMMA that their husband would maybe have a job ,COMMA but that mostly he would be at home taking care of the kiddies .PERIOD 
and this was kind of a shocker to me .PERIOD 
they basically enshrined the second-class status of women in the civil code .PERIOD 
for one thing ,COMMA it puts men and women in a really antagonistic relationship with one another ,COMMA because the men are these devious tricksters up there who've put up this glass ceiling .PERIOD 
so the image that i like to think of ,COMMA instead of glass ceiling ,COMMA is the high bridge .PERIOD 
there's no man or woman standing in the middle about to cut the cables .PERIOD 
to the dismay of my mother ,COMMA this is dangerous teenage fashion right there .PERIOD 
really make a fully integrated product ,COMMA something beautiful .PERIOD 
this baby is fully electric .PERIOD 
they will start flying .PERIOD 
the year is <NUM> .PERIOD 
can you see ,COMMA as the years pass by ,COMMA child survival is increasing ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's only by child survival that we will stop population growth .PERIOD 
in the front ,COMMA you see ,COMMA actually ,COMMA joe murray getting the patient ready for the transplant ,COMMA while in the back room you see hartwell harrison ,COMMA the chief of urology at harvard ,COMMA actually harvesting the kidney .PERIOD 
that really has to do with our aging population .PERIOD 
it's not really that foreign of a concept ,COMMA actually ;SEMICOLON it happens on the earth every day .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA your body is constantly regenerating .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA how can we harness that power ?QUESTIONMARK 
that's exactly what you see here .PERIOD 
to the naked eye they look like a piece of your blouse ,COMMA or your shirt ,COMMA but actually these materials are fairly complex and they are designed to degrade once inside the body .PERIOD 
it disintegrates a few months later .PERIOD 
what about other structures ?QUESTIONMARK 
this is actually an engineered blood vessel .PERIOD 
you now have your fully seeded scaffold .PERIOD 
we then take a scaffold that we shape like a bladder .PERIOD 
we place it back into this oven-like device .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA bladders are definitely a little bit more complex than the other structures .PERIOD 
but there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it .PERIOD 
we exercise these prior to implantation .PERIOD 
all we are left with is the skeleton ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA of the liver ,COMMA all made up of collagen ,COMMA a material that's in our bodies ,COMMA that will not reject .PERIOD 
this is still experimental .PERIOD but we are able to actually reproduce the functionality of the liver structure ,COMMA experimentally .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA another strategy we're following is actually to create wafers that we stack together ,COMMA like an accordion ,COMMA if you will .PERIOD 
if at all possible ,COMMA we really would like to use smart biomaterials that we can just take off the shelf and regenerate your organs .PERIOD 
why ?QUESTIONMARK because we'd rather take those cells which already know that those are the cell types you want .PERIOD 
and we prefer cells that will not reject and will not form tumors .PERIOD 
and we're working a lot with the stem cells that we published on two years ago ,COMMA stem cells from the amniotic fluid ,COMMA and the placenta ,COMMA which have those properties .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i always like to show this cartoon .PERIOD 
and there you see the stagecoach driver ,COMMA and he goes ,COMMA on the top panel ,COMMA he goes a ,COMMA b ,COMMA c ,COMMA d ,COMMA e ,COMMA f .PERIOD 
entrepreneurs are people - because we have a lot of them in this room - who have these ideas and these passions or see these needs in the world and we decide to stand up and do it .PERIOD 
and as a young kid ,COMMA nobody can say it can't happen because you're too dumb to realize that you couldn't figure it out .PERIOD 
if we can teach our kids to become entrepreneurial - the ones that show those traits to be - like we teach the ones who have science gifts to go on in science ,COMMA what if we saw the ones who had entrepreneurial traits and taught them to be entrepreneurs ?QUESTIONMARK 
we could actually have all these kids spreading businesses instead of waiting for government handouts .PERIOD 
and the media says that it's really cool if we could go out and be a model or a singer or a sports hero like luongo ,COMMA crosby .PERIOD 
our mba programs do not teach kids to be entrepreneurs .PERIOD 
we didn't fit in the normal work .PERIOD we couldn't work for somebody else because we're too stubborn and we have all these other traits .PERIOD 
i could go on and on .PERIOD 
fit into this other system and try to become a student .PERIOD 
i'm also quoted - and i told the person who wrote the textbook - i'm now quoted in that exact same university textbook in every canadian university and college studies .PERIOD 
i open up chapter eight talking about budgeting .PERIOD 
and i told the author ,COMMA after they did my interview ,COMMA that i cheated in that same course .PERIOD 
and my mom came into the room and she said ,COMMA where are you going to get the coat hangers to sell to the dry cleaners ?QUESTIONMARK 
i'm like ,COMMA but you have two cars and they don't have license plate protectors .PERIOD 
so i knew there were two cars with two license plates on each .PERIOD 
but it was obvious to me ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK buy low ,COMMA sell high .PERIOD 
don't try to sell to the poor kids ;SEMICOLON they don't have cash .PERIOD the rich people do .PERIOD go get some .PERIOD 
so that's obvious ,COMMA right .PERIOD 
and making money off that too .PERIOD 
i built these little pincushions when i was <NUM> years old in cubs ,COMMA and we made these pin cushions for our moms for mother's day .PERIOD 
and you'd make these chairs .PERIOD 
you get the golf balls ,COMMA and you just throw them in your bathing suit trunks and when you're done you've got a couple hundred of them .PERIOD 
and they could use those for practice balls .PERIOD 
but it paid the bills .PERIOD 
i remember being told to walk out in the middle of a street in banff ,COMMA alberta because i'd thrown a penny out in the street ,COMMA and my dad said ,COMMA go pick it up .PERIOD 
but then we negotiate on what they're going to get paid .PERIOD 
you breed that kind of stuff .PERIOD each of my kids has two piggy banks .PERIOD 
the <NUM> percent that goes in their house account ,COMMA every six months ,COMMA goes to the bank .PERIOD 
just do that kind of stuff and have fun with it .PERIOD 
we have all these lessons in front of us ,COMMA but we don't take those opportunities ;SEMICOLON we teach kids to go get a tutor .PERIOD 
my kids love this stuff .PERIOD 
it's a video that was done by one of the companies that i mentor .PERIOD 
they were trying to figure out how to rebuild their universities .PERIOD 
since education under the soviet union was essentially propaganda serving the purposes of a state ideology ,COMMA they appreciated that it would take wholesale transformations if they were to provide an education worthy of free men and women .PERIOD 
you may think you know what is going on in that jane austen novel - that is ,COMMA until your first encounter with postmodern deconstructionism .PERIOD 
when the astronomical distance between the realities of the academy and the visionary intensity of this challenge were more than enough ,COMMA i can assure you ,COMMA to give one pause ,COMMA what was happening outside higher education made backing off unthinkable .PERIOD 
and that was only the beginning .PERIOD 
incredibly ,COMMA this nation ,COMMA with all its material ,COMMA intellectual and spiritual resources ,COMMA seems utterly helpless to reverse the freefall in any of these areas .PERIOD 
we are playing with fire .PERIOD 
on a more personal note ,COMMA this betrayal of our principles ,COMMA our decency ,COMMA our hope ,COMMA made it impossible for me to avoid the question ,COMMA what will i say ,COMMA years from now ,COMMA when people ask ,COMMA'where were you ?QUESTIONMARK' as president of a leading liberal arts college ,COMMA famous for its innovative history ,COMMA there were no excuses .PERIOD 
the challenge :COLON to figure out what it will take to actually do something that makes a significant and sustainable difference .PERIOD 
even more valuable ,COMMA history provides a laboratory in which we see played out the actual ,COMMA as well as the intended consequences of ideas .PERIOD 
students ,COMMA in turn ,COMMA continuously move outside the classroom to engage the world directly .PERIOD 
this is a political education ,COMMA to be sure .PERIOD 
the center will embody and sustain this new educational commitment .PERIOD 
what is certain is that the individual talent exhibited in such abundance here ,COMMA needs to turn its attention to that collaborative ,COMMA messy ,COMMA frustrating ,COMMA contentious and impossible world of politics and public policy .PERIOD 
all right .PERIOD okay ,COMMA so .PERIOD perfect .PERIOD 
they go to church ,COMMA by which i mean ,COMMA they do lots of things for free for each other .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i know you don't believe me ,COMMA really ,COMMA here .PERIOD 
he's a terrible producer of videos ,COMMA but it's great content ,COMMA so i'm going to give you a little bit of it .PERIOD 
so here he is beginning .PERIOD 
this is this fantastic brat pack remix set to lisztomania .PERIOD 
they decided they wanted to do the same .PERIOD 
so that's importantly different from the earlier videos we looked at because here ,COMMA remix isn't just about an individual doing something alone in his basement ;SEMICOLON it becomes an act of social creativity .PERIOD 
indeed ,COMMA mickey mouse himself ,COMMA of course ,COMMA as steamboat willie ,COMMA is a remix of the then ,COMMA very dominant ,COMMA very popular steamboat bill by buster keaton .PERIOD 
he is the celebration and ideal of exactly this kind of creativity .PERIOD 
but then the company passes through this dark stage to this democrat .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA for a second example ,COMMA think about this cultural hero ,COMMA icon on the left ,COMMA creator of this character .PERIOD 
look at the site that he built :COLON star wars mashups ,COMMA inviting people to come and use their creative energy to produce a new generation of attention towards this extraordinarily important cultural icon .PERIOD 
so the point is the republicans here recognize that there's a certain need of ownership ,COMMA a respect for ownership ,COMMA the respect we should give the creator ,COMMA the remixer ,COMMA the owner ,COMMA the property owner ,COMMA the copyright owner of this extraordinarily powerful stuff ,COMMA and not a generation of sharecroppers .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i think there are lessons we should learn here ,COMMA lessons about openness .PERIOD 
our lives are sharing activities ,COMMA at least in part .PERIOD 
that's number one .PERIOD number two :COLON this ecology of sharing needs freedom within which to create .PERIOD 
and number three :COLON we need to respect the creator ,COMMA the creator of these remixes through rights that are directly tied to them .PERIOD 
these tools that we built enable this sharing in parts through licenses that make it clear and a freedom to create without requiring permission first because the permission has already been granted and a respect for the creator because it builds upon a copyright the creator has licensed freely .PERIOD 
and it explains the vast right-wing conspiracy that's obviously developed around these licenses ,COMMA as now more than <NUM> million digital objects are out there ,COMMA licensed freely in this way .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA if we can learn those values from at least some influences on the right ,COMMA if we can take them and incorporate them ,COMMA maybe we could do a little trade .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA someone on reddit thought ,COMMA oh ,COMMA what a great thing ,COMMA we should all vote this up .PERIOD 
and that was that the internet loves mister splashy pants .PERIOD 
they even created an e-card so you could send your friend a dancing splashy .PERIOD 
there are so many great publishing tools that are available ,COMMA it only takes a few minutes of your time now to actually produce something .PERIOD 
if you want to succeed you've got to be okay to just lose control .PERIOD 
well we all know the world wide web has absolutely transformed publishing ,COMMA broadcasting ,COMMA commerce and social connectivity ,COMMA but where did it all come from ?QUESTIONMARK 
vannevar bush was the u.s. government's chief scientific adviser during the war .PERIOD 
and the memex would link information ,COMMA one piece of information to a related piece of information and so forth .PERIOD 
he built a system .PERIOD 
and we delivered the world's first hypertext system .PERIOD 
they had a 12-page supplement in the wall street journal the day it launched .PERIOD 
i thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA interesting ,COMMA but a guy from cern ,COMMA he's not going to do this .PERIOD 
in <NUM> ,COMMA his paper was rejected for the hypertext conference .PERIOD 
secondly ,COMMA for the first time in the modern era ,COMMA the dominant country in the world - which i think is what china will become - will be not from the west and from very ,COMMA very different civilizational roots .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i know it's a widespread assumption in the west that as countries modernize ,COMMA they also westernize .PERIOD 
it will remain in very fundamental respects very different .PERIOD 
in other words ,COMMA china ,COMMA unlike the western states and most countries in the world ,COMMA is shaped by its sense of civilization ,COMMA its existence as a civilization-state ,COMMA rather than as a nation-state .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA basically the east was swallowed by the west .PERIOD 
hence their attitude ,COMMA for example ,COMMA to the uyghurs and to the tibetans .PERIOD 
this is the chinese view of the state - very ,COMMA very different to ours .PERIOD 
know that china believes in the market and the state .PERIOD 
moreover ,COMMA this is a very old state tradition ,COMMA a very old tradition of statecraft .PERIOD 
and yet we still insist ,COMMA by and large ,COMMA in thinking that we can understand china by simply drawing on western experience ,COMMA looking at it through western eyes ,COMMA using western concepts .PERIOD 
but it's not .PERIOD 
whereas those cultures - virtually the rest of the world ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA which have been in a far weaker position ,COMMA vis-a-vis the west - have been thereby forced to understand the west ,COMMA because of the west's presence in those societies .PERIOD 
because what's happening ?QUESTIONMARK back to that chart at the beginning ,COMMA the goldman sachs chart .PERIOD 
europe was not at the final negotiating table .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA maybe that's true ,COMMA maybe that's an exaggeration .PERIOD 
but there's another problem which goes along with this - that europe is increasingly out of touch with the world - and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future .PERIOD 
or take this :COLON now this is an idea ,COMMA but it's an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of beijing .PERIOD 
accelerometers on each hand read hand position .PERIOD 
and he was very impressed .PERIOD he was all tearing up .PERIOD ready to hug me .PERIOD 
i must have done about <NUM> caricatures .PERIOD 
that evening ,COMMA i came home to hundreds of hate mails ,COMMA hundreds of people telling me how they could have lived another day without seeing this .PERIOD 
i was also asked to leave the organization ,COMMA a cartoonists' organization in america ,COMMA that for me was my lifeline .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA all of a sudden ,COMMA my paintings came alive .PERIOD 
the collaborative effort was fabulous .PERIOD 
since i mentioned my wife ,COMMA the most important collaboration has been with her ,COMMA netra .PERIOD 
i must have been <NUM> and a half then ,COMMA and it was love at first sight .PERIOD 
i lived in india .PERIOD she lived in america .PERIOD 
notice one thing ,COMMA we're equal here .PERIOD 
we had fashion designers ,COMMA installation artists ,COMMA models ,COMMA we had makeup artists ,COMMA jewelry designers ,COMMA all kinds of people working with me to make my wedding an art installation .PERIOD 
and i had a special installation in tribute to my in-laws .PERIOD 
i could not live this larger than life person .PERIOD 
this time i said let's try something different .PERIOD 
and this was just eight months ago .PERIOD 
i walk into her room ,COMMA and there was a shy girl ,COMMA and she was bald ,COMMA and she was trying to hide her baldness .PERIOD 
i whipped out my pen ,COMMA and i started drawing on her head and i drew a crown for her .PERIOD 
our computers ,COMMA our systems will be as primitive as the apollo's are for today .PERIOD 
we can develop any part of the body .PERIOD 
the other major development is going to be in the area of what can happen in genetics .PERIOD 
this would imply a massive leap in migration .PERIOD 
an individual ,COMMA for the first time in the history of humanity ,COMMA will have the capacity ,COMMA by <NUM> ,COMMA to destroy the planet ,COMMA to wreck everything ,COMMA through the creation ,COMMA for example ,COMMA of a biopathogen .PERIOD 
more people ,COMMA smaller spaces ,COMMA less stuff .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA i want to use zipcar .PERIOD 
and so from a branding perspective ,COMMA they got a lot right .PERIOD 
platforms are invitations .PERIOD 
so creating craigslist or itunes and the iphone developer network ,COMMA there are all these networks - facebook as well .PERIOD 
essentially ,COMMA there are all sorts of restaurants in oakland ,COMMA near where i live .PERIOD 
and one quick example is velib ,COMMA in <NUM> ,COMMA came forward in paris with a very bold proposition ,COMMA a very big bike-sharing service .PERIOD 
we're at the very beginning of something that ,COMMA what we're seeing and the way that mesh companies are coming forward ,COMMA is inviting ,COMMA it's engaging ,COMMA but it's very early .PERIOD 
you have to make a wish to save the world .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA i can't save the world .PERIOD nobody can .PERIOD 
i know those guys .PERIOD 
it was the only one i had at that time .PERIOD 
they were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves .PERIOD 
so we decided to take portraits of palestinians and israelis doing the same jobs - taxi-driver ,COMMA lawyer ,COMMA cooks .PERIOD 
the experts said ,COMMA no way .PERIOD 
we said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA let's try and push as far as we can .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA for example ,COMMA that's palestine .PERIOD 
we need culture out there .PERIOD 
you see that enough in the media .PERIOD 
what i want to show is the incredible life .PERIOD 
during that time ,COMMA you haven't thought about what you're going to eat tomorrow .PERIOD 
when you look at kibera now ,COMMA they look back .PERIOD 
so we could just walk in the street during the next days and the photos would get revealed by themselves .PERIOD 
so we didn't get caught this time .PERIOD 
hopefully ,COMMA you'll see the film ,COMMA and you'll understand the scope of the project and what the people felt when they saw those photos .PERIOD 
because that's a big part of it .PERIOD there's layers behind each photo .PERIOD 
but tell me ,COMMA advertising for what ?QUESTIONMARK 
the people i photograph were proud to participate in the project and to have their photo in the community .PERIOD 
the importance is what you do with the images ,COMMA the statement it makes where it's pasted .PERIOD 
this image of three men wearing gas masks was taken in chernobyl originally ,COMMA and i pasted it in southern italy ,COMMA where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground .PERIOD 
so a subject you're passionate about ,COMMA a person who you want to tell their story or even your own photos - tell me what you stand for .PERIOD 
einstein's especially interested in penelope's talk .PERIOD 
a lot of her research goes on in caves ,COMMA which can get pretty dusty .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA that's really cool ,COMMA but what einstein's really hoping is that maybe he'll genetically engineer a five-pound peanut .PERIOD 
that is one big peanut .PERIOD since einstein is a bird ,COMMA she's very interested in things that fly .PERIOD 
or maybe sirena huang would like to learn some arias on her violin ,COMMA and einstein can sing along with some opera ?QUESTIONMARK 
or maybe stu just needs another backup singer ?QUESTIONMARK 
you like to drink water .PERIOD 
again .PERIOD 
e :COLON ooooowww .PERIOD 
e :COLON goodbye .PERIOD 
and about five years ago ,COMMA we asked what was the most important need for innovation in schooling here in the u.k .PERIOD 
the minister of education down south in london described himself as a big fan .PERIOD 
they're not like all of you who can sit in rows and hear things said to you for hour after hour .PERIOD 
i would run into the living room ,COMMA jump up on the couch ,COMMA rip the cushions off ,COMMA throw them on the floor ,COMMA scream at the top of my lungs and run out because i was the incredible hulk .PERIOD 
and i would like to share my art .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA moving onward .PERIOD 
first principles ,COMMA this is very important .PERIOD 
i tried kickboards .PERIOD 
hand paddles ,COMMA everything .PERIOD 
kicking harder doesn't solve the problem because the average swimmer only transfers about three percent of their energy expenditure into forward motion .PERIOD 
so let's look at some examples .PERIOD this is terry .PERIOD 
rather ,COMMA he is entering the water at a 45-degree angle with his forearm ,COMMA and then propelling himself by streamlining - very important .PERIOD 
below is what most swimmers will find enables them to do what i did ,COMMA which is going from <NUM> strokes per 20-yard length to <NUM> strokes in two workouts with no coach ,COMMA no video monitoring .PERIOD 
in freestyle ,COMMA easiest way to remedy this is to turn with body roll ,COMMA and just to look at your recovery hand as it enters the water .PERIOD 
then i transferred to a different school sophomore year ,COMMA and i had a choice of other languages .PERIOD most of my friends were taking japanese .PERIOD 
i couldn't believe i was on the other side of the world .PERIOD 
and a teacher came up to me and handed me a piece of paper .PERIOD 
and that's pretty much my response .PERIOD 
nothing worked until i found this .PERIOD 
many of the publications in japan limit themselves to these characters ,COMMA to facilitate literacy - some are required to .PERIOD 
and now i love languages .PERIOD 
i was so concerned with her perception of what i was doing ,COMMA that it exploded in my face ,COMMA never to return to the ballroom dancing club .PERIOD 
everyone burst into laughter .PERIOD i was humiliated .PERIOD 
so i had a very short deadline for a competition .PERIOD 
these seemed to be the three areas that i could exploit to compete if i wanted to comptete against people who'd been practicing for <NUM> to <NUM> years .PERIOD 
that photo is of the semi-finals of the buenos aires championships ,COMMA four months later .PERIOD 
then one month later ,COMMA went to the world championships ,COMMA made it to the semi-final .PERIOD and then set a world record ,COMMA following that ,COMMA two weeks later .PERIOD 
so he can lift the woman to break her ,COMMA for example .PERIOD 
there are many different types .PERIOD 
i have hundreds of hours of footage - all categorized ,COMMA much like george carlin categorized his comedy .PERIOD 
so fear is your friend .PERIOD fear is an indicator .PERIOD 
especially with fears you gained when you were a child .PERIOD 
and if any of you are interested in that ,COMMA i would love to speak with you .PERIOD 
but i ask a lot of questions ,COMMA and i would love your advice .PERIOD 
it's written using wiki software - which is the type of software he just demonstrated - so anyone can quickly edit and save ,COMMA and it goes live on the internet immediately .PERIOD 
so when yochai is talking about new methods of organization ,COMMA he's exactly describing wikipedia .PERIOD and what i'm going to do today is tell you a little bit more about how it really works on the inside .PERIOD 
and so if you think about what that means ,COMMA it means a lot more than just building a cool website .PERIOD 
and so that's a big part of why we've chosen the free licensing model ,COMMA because that empowers local entrepreneurs - or anyone who wants to ,COMMA can take our content and do anything they like with it - you can copy it ,COMMA redistribute it and you can do it commercially or non-commercially .PERIOD 
the biggest languages are german ,COMMA japanese ,COMMA french - all the western european languages are quite big .PERIOD 
so the big question when you've got this really chaotic organization is ,COMMA why isn't it all rubbish ?QUESTIONMARK why is the website as good as it is ?QUESTIONMARK 
the actual truth about the specific bush-kerry incident is that the bush-kerry articles were locked less than one percent of the time in <NUM> ,COMMA and it wasn't because they were contentious ;SEMICOLON it was just because there was routine vandalism - which happens sometimes even on stage ,COMMA people - sometimes even reporters have reported to me that they vandalize wikipedia and were amazed that it was fixed so quickly .PERIOD 
so the biggest and the most important thing is our neutral point-of-view policy .PERIOD 
if you engage in that type of behavior ,COMMA you'll be asked to leave the community .PERIOD 
and then users can set up their own personal watch list .PERIOD 
so my page is on quite a few volunteers' watch lists ,COMMA because it is sometimes vandalized .PERIOD 
and that's a really important thing to understand ,COMMA is that the vast majority of the edits that go on on the website are from a very close-knit community of maybe <NUM> to <NUM> people who are in constant communication .PERIOD 
another thing that we do within the community is we leave everything very open-ended .PERIOD 
i give this talk sometimes with angela ,COMMA who was just re-elected to the board from the community - to the board of the foundation ,COMMA with more than twice the votes of the person who didn't make it .PERIOD 
of course ,COMMA the vote ended up being about <NUM> to <NUM> ,COMMA so there was no real danger to our democratic processes .PERIOD 
it strikes me that much of the textbooks that are used to educate our children are inherently biased .PERIOD 
have you found wikipedia being used by teachers ,COMMA and how do you see wikipedia changing education ?QUESTIONMARK 
it builds on the storyline of bloggers versus newspapers .PERIOD 
i sent it from my harvard email address ,COMMA because i was recently appointed a fellow there .PERIOD 
and so the wiki books project is an effort to do that .PERIOD 
in the jungles of guatemala ,COMMA in tikal ,COMMA stands a temple .PERIOD 
his name was jasaw chan k'awiil .PERIOD 
he lived into his <NUM> ,COMMA and he was buried beneath this monument in <NUM> ad .PERIOD 
they've never found a society that did not have it .PERIOD 
it was told by an anonymous kwakiutl indian of southern alaska to a missionary in <NUM> ,COMMA and here it is .PERIOD 
it's below your emotions .PERIOD 
it comes from a david mamet play ,COMMA and there's two con artists in the play ,COMMA and the woman is conning the man ,COMMA and the man looks at the woman and says ,COMMA oh ,COMMA you're a bad pony ,COMMA i'm not going to bet on you .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what have i learned from this experiment that i would like to tell the world ?QUESTIONMARK 
too old ,COMMA too young ,COMMA too scruffy ,COMMA too stupid ,COMMA and they won't do it .PERIOD 
and in fact ,COMMA sometimes i feel a little sorry for the chicken on my dinner plate ,COMMA when i think of how intense this brain system is .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA i've spent the last three years on this .PERIOD

if australia had to send a thousand people tomorrow to west papua for example ,COMMA we don't have a thousand police officers hanging around that could just go tomorrow and we do have a thousand soldiers that could go .PERIOD 
so when we have to send someone ,COMMA we send the military - because they're there ,COMMA they're available and ,COMMA heck ,COMMA they're used to going off and doing these things and living by themselves and not having all this extra support .PERIOD 
one particular thing that's come up that i am especially interested in is the question of whether ,COMMA when we're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs ,COMMA we ought to be equipping them differently ,COMMA and in particular ,COMMA whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the sorts of non-lethal weapons that police have .PERIOD 
military personnel are being trained for war ,COMMA so they're trained that ,COMMA as soon as things go bad ,COMMA their first response is lethal force .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA being australian ,COMMA i started looking at stuff in australia ,COMMA knowing ,COMMA again ,COMMA from my own experience about various times when non-lethal weapons have been introduced in australia .PERIOD 
this is something they can use instead of a firearm in those situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone .PERIOD 
this was something explicitly introduced to be an alternative to firearms ,COMMA but it's being routinely used to deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems .PERIOD 
now one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of non-lethal weapons - and people when they're actually saying ,COMMA well hey ,COMMA there might be some problems - there's a couple of particular problems that get focused on .PERIOD 
you have to be careful about who you're shooting at .PERIOD 
they were holding something like <NUM> people hostage .PERIOD 
and it's no surprise that people died ,COMMA because you don't know how much of this gas each person is going to inhale ,COMMA what position they're going to fall in when they become unconscious and so on .PERIOD 
the person who's spraying the o.c .PERIOD spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don't get contaminated and so on .PERIOD 
just in case you think it's only going to happen in the united states ,COMMA it happened in canada as well .PERIOD 
and a colleague of mine sent me this one from london .PERIOD 
i looked at it .PERIOD i was really surprised .PERIOD 
so if you have these problems with police officers with non-lethal weapons ,COMMA what on earth would make you think it's going to be better with military personnel ?QUESTIONMARK 
what would these guys have done if they'd had access to tasers or to a manned ,COMMA portable version of the active denial system - a small heat ray that you can use on people and not worry about it .PERIOD 
and here he'll explain a little bit about what it does .PERIOD 
and i found this old video .PERIOD 
with our strengths and our minds and spirit ,COMMA we gather ,COMMA we form ,COMMA and we fashion .PERIOD 
this particular reel - it's an industrial video - but it was shown in drive-in theaters in <NUM> - in the detroit area ,COMMA in fact - and it preceded alfred hitchcock's psycho .PERIOD 
and when i sat down next to him ,COMMA he was telling me about a company he formed ,COMMA and he was building some robots for automobile factories to move things around on the factory floor .PERIOD 
now the other thing that i think is taking off ,COMMA another reason making is taking off today ,COMMA is there's some great new tools out there .PERIOD 
so they're the brains of maker projects ,COMMA and here's an example of one .PERIOD 
these guys came up with a kit version for <NUM> dollars ,COMMA and that means that hobbyists and ordinary folks can get a hold of this and begin playing with <NUM> printers .PERIOD 
isn't that cool ?QUESTIONMARK 
well he did a little bit better than free .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we all think we know what glamour is .PERIOD here it is .PERIOD 
it's glamorous movie stars ,COMMA like marlene dietrich .PERIOD 
fantastic ,COMMA glamorous pictures of steel mills and paper mills and all kinds of glamorous industrial places .PERIOD 
you had a glamour .PERIOD 
there is a process of idealization ,COMMA glorification and dramatization ,COMMA and it's not just the case for people .PERIOD 
glamour doesn't have to be people .PERIOD 
it puts you into this special ,COMMA special world .PERIOD 
she's not looking away from you exactly ,COMMA but you have to mentally imagine her world .PERIOD 
she's encouraging you to contemplate this higher world to which she belongs ,COMMA where she can be completely tranquil while holding the iron instruments of her death by torture .PERIOD 
this sort of streamlining styling is not just glamorous because we associate it with movies of that period ,COMMA but because ,COMMA in it's streamlining ,COMMA it transports us from the everyday .PERIOD 
to conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort :COLON and this is one of the critical aspects of glamour .PERIOD 
but if you look in a catalog - particularly a catalog of modern ,COMMA beautiful objects for your home - it looks like this .PERIOD 
part of the thing is that ,COMMA in rear window ,COMMA the question is ,COMMA is she too glamorous to live in his world ?QUESTIONMARK 
and the answer is no ,COMMA but of course it's really just a movie .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this session's supposed to be about pure pleasure but glamour's really partly about meaning .PERIOD 
the perfect love life - symbolized by the perfect necklace ,COMMA the perfect diamond ring .PERIOD 
this is an interior design firm that is literally called utopia .PERIOD 
but there's a kind of wonder in the stuff that gets edited away in the cords of life .PERIOD 
david hockney talks about how the appreciation of this very glamorous painting is heightened if you think about the fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash ,COMMA which only took a fraction of a second to happen .PERIOD 
but i also knew how hard they worked all week .PERIOD 
but as a scientist ,COMMA i'm interested in a different problem of other minds ,COMMA and that is the one i'm going to introduce to you today .PERIOD 
and then finally ,COMMA to show that some of the differences between people ,COMMA in how we judge others ,COMMA can be explained by differences in this brain system .PERIOD 
child :COLON what ?QUESTIONMARK rs :COLON pirates really like cheese sandwiches .PERIOD 
this pirate is called joshua .PERIOD 
now i'm going to show you a three-year-old who got the same puzzle .PERIOD 
so the three-year-old does two things differently .PERIOD 
and second ,COMMA when he sees ivan taking the sandwich where he left his ,COMMA where we would say he's taking that one because he thinks it's his ,COMMA the three-year-old comes up with another explanation :COLON he's not taking his own sandwich because he doesn't want it ,COMMA because now it's dirty ,COMMA on the ground .PERIOD 
so that's why he's taking the other sandwich .PERIOD 
and we can see the continuation of this process of learning to think about other people's thoughts by upping the ante and asking children now ,COMMA not for an action prediction ,COMMA but for a moral judgment .PERIOD 
remember the five-year-old completely understood why ivan took joshua's sandwich .PERIOD 
was ivan being mean and naughty for taking joshua's sandwich ?QUESTIONMARK 
he says the wind should get in trouble for switching the sandwiches .PERIOD 
and so what we wanted to know was ,COMMA could differences among adults in how they think about other people's thoughts be explained in terms of differences in this brain region ?QUESTIONMARK 
and her friend drinks the coffee ,COMMA and is fine .PERIOD 
and what you can see is ,COMMA on the left when there was very little activity in this brain region ,COMMA people paid little attention to her innocent belief and said she deserved a lot of blame for the accident .PERIOD 
first ,COMMA i'm going to show you that this is a magnetic pulse .PERIOD 
i'm going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine .PERIOD 
but in the case of a failed attempt to harm ,COMMA where grace thought that it was poison ,COMMA although it was really sugar ,COMMA people now say it was more okay ,COMMA she deserves less blame for putting the powder in the coffee .PERIOD 
so it's not a surreptitious technology .PERIOD 
so i've got one last question .PERIOD there is this thing called the hard problem of consciousness ,COMMA that puzzles a lot of people .PERIOD 
why ?QUESTIONMARK 
me was composed of stories ,COMMA of cravings ,COMMA of strivings ,COMMA of desires of the future .PERIOD 
me only existed in the trying .PERIOD 
babies actually don't come out of your mouth .PERIOD 
i would drive it and demand things from it .PERIOD 
i didn't heed it ;SEMICOLON no ,COMMA i organized it and i directed it .PERIOD 
i took more than my body had to offer .PERIOD 
cancer exploded the wall of my disconnection .PERIOD 
now i am swimming in it .PERIOD 
so we brought her home ,COMMA and i prayed that the oil wouldn't wash up on her beach before she died .PERIOD 
and i said ,COMMA but what's the water part ?QUESTIONMARK 
it was my whole self melting into michaela's lap .PERIOD 
it was finding my place and the huge responsibility that comes with connection .PERIOD 
it was energy ,COMMA love and joy .PERIOD 
it was all these things .PERIOD 
because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down ,COMMA but they want to know how to slow down really quickly .PERIOD so .PERIOD 
so i was in new york recently ,COMMA and i walked past a gym that had an advertisement in the window for a new course ,COMMA a new evening course .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA a burnout ,COMMA or eventually the body says ,COMMA i can't take it anymore ,COMMA and throws in the towel .PERIOD 
am i really in such a hurry that i'm prepared to fob off my son with a sound byte at the end of the day ?QUESTIONMARK 
i just thought ,COMMA and i thought long and hard .PERIOD 
and by the time i got off that plane ,COMMA i'd decided i wanted to do something about it .PERIOD 
time is scarce ,COMMA so what do we do ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i guess that the question is ,COMMA is it possible to break free from that mindset ?QUESTIONMARK 
and ,COMMA in this kind of cauldron of moments and places and acts of deceleration ,COMMA lie what a lot of people now refer to as the international slow movement .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA you tap into that - those deeper ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA psychological ,COMMA emotional ,COMMA spiritual currents ,COMMA and you get a better orgasm with the buildup .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA you heard that i got a speeding ticket while i was researching my book on the benefits of slowness ,COMMA and that's true ,COMMA but that's not all of it .PERIOD 
i think there's a kind of metaphysical dimension - that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off from the bigger ,COMMA deeper questions .PERIOD 
we fill our head with distraction ,COMMA with busyness ,COMMA so that we don't have to ask ,COMMA am i well ?QUESTIONMARK am i happy ?QUESTIONMARK are my children growing up right ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's become my reward at the end of the day ,COMMA something i really cherish .PERIOD 
i was downstairs by the front door ,COMMA and i was waiting for a taxi ,COMMA and my son came down the stairs and he'd made a card for me .PERIOD and he was carrying it .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what i'd like to talk about is something that was very dear to kahn's heart ,COMMA which is :COLON how do we discover what is really particular about a project ?QUESTIONMARK 
this used to be an island - ackerman island - and we filled in the channel during the depression to create jobs .PERIOD 
and here's the building as it opened ,COMMA with a channel overlooking downtown ,COMMA and as seen from downtown .PERIOD 
every piece of the building works .PERIOD 
i was very moved by what i saw today .PERIOD 
let's get back to the town and walk to the site .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA as things are a little easier in india ,COMMA the site was purchased within a week and we were working .PERIOD 
and the structures rise from the sand cliffs - they're built in concrete and sandstones ;SEMICOLON the roofs are stainless steel - they are facing south and reflecting light towards the temple itself ,COMMA pedestrians crisscross from one side to the other .PERIOD 
back to yad vashem three years ago .PERIOD after all this episode began ,COMMA yad vashem decided to rebuild completely the historic museum because now washington was built - the holocaust museum in washington - and that museum is so much more comprehensive in terms of information .PERIOD 
they said ,COMMA let's rebuild the museum .PERIOD 
and here studying ,COMMA in three dimensions ,COMMA how to give some kind ,COMMA again ,COMMA of order ,COMMA a structure ;SEMICOLON not something you feel you could just change because you stop the design of that particular process .PERIOD 
i'd like to conclude by relating all of what i've said to the term beauty .PERIOD 
we call a natural object beautiful because we see that its form expresses fitness ,COMMA the perfect fulfillment of function .PERIOD 
nevertheless ,COMMA beauty as the kind of fit ;SEMICOLON something that tells us that all the forces that have to do with our natural environment have been fulfilled - and our human environment - for that .PERIOD 
he who seeks truth shall find beauty .PERIOD he who seeks beauty shall find vanity .PERIOD 
he who considers himself the servant of his fellow beings shall find the joy of self-expression .PERIOD he who seeks self-expression shall fall into the pit of arrogance .PERIOD 
my name is kailash .PERIOD and i like to enrich lives through technicolored glass .PERIOD 
a rising tide lifts all boats .PERIOD 
it felt like it was really important .PERIOD 
i just really wanted to acknowledge you .PERIOD 
it is really a sacred space .PERIOD 
see ,COMMA these all lie right inside of this general emotional palette that we were painting .PERIOD 
the only way that i would say it was a mistake is in that we didn't react to it .PERIOD 
it was an opportunity that was missed .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it's just a season .PERIOD and there are two seasons in most of south asia .PERIOD 
high pressure builds over india .PERIOD 
a few kilometers ,COMMA maybe ,COMMA is quite typical .PERIOD 
and this is called the globe skimmer ,COMMA or wandering glider .PERIOD 
but it really hasn't been studied very much .PERIOD 
it's a rather mediocre looking dragonfly .PERIOD 
if you're going to study dragonflies ,COMMA you want to study those really bright beautiful ones ,COMMA like that red one .PERIOD or the really rare ones ,COMMA the endemic endangered ones .PERIOD 
and they were there for some time .PERIOD and then they were gone .PERIOD 
and i didn't think anything more of it until the following year ,COMMA when it happened again ,COMMA and then the year after that ,COMMA and then the year after that .PERIOD 
and on top of the coral reefs are sand banks .PERIOD 
those of you who are indian or spent your childhood here ,COMMA let me have a show of hands ,COMMA who of you - not yet ,COMMA not yet !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
so ,COMMA are these things ,COMMA how are these things getting here ?QUESTIONMARK 
it stretches about <NUM> miles ,COMMA of course it's india here .PERIOD 
when do you see the dragonflies appear ?QUESTIONMARK 
and then the southernmost maldives .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i started a very rigorous scientific process .PERIOD 
it doesn't make sense .PERIOD there is nothing for them in maldives .PERIOD 
and we're starting in june .PERIOD so this is the monsoon rain .PERIOD 
nothing for these dragonflies .PERIOD there is no more seasonal rain .PERIOD 
they're looking for somewhere to breed .PERIOD if it rains here they'll breed .PERIOD 
they'll hatch out in six weeks .PERIOD by that time the seasonal rains have moved on .PERIOD it's not there ,COMMA it's down here .PERIOD 
they'll fly down here .PERIOD and the clever thing is the wind is always converging to where the rain is .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA the little fellow that hatches out here ,COMMA he gets up into the air ,COMMA he is automatically carried to where the rain is falling .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA in four generations ,COMMA one ,COMMA two ,COMMA three ,COMMA four and then back .PERIOD 
a complete circuit of the indian ocean .PERIOD 
there is more to the story .PERIOD 
which is an area along the amur river ,COMMA which is up here .PERIOD 
he's an engineer .PERIOD 
half as much money was spent on this norden bombsight as was spent on the most famous military-industrial project of the modern era .PERIOD 
it allowed you to bomb only those things that you absolutely needed and wanted to bomb .PERIOD 
and it's carried in a box with a canvas shroud over it .PERIOD 
it's never allowed to be photographed .PERIOD 
there are clouds ,COMMA right .PERIOD 
the leuna chemical plant ,COMMA after one of the most extensive bombings in the history of the war ,COMMA was up and running within weeks .PERIOD 
so i would like to invite you ,COMMA also ,COMMA for a while ,COMMA to the himalayas themselves .PERIOD 
and to show the place where meditators ,COMMA like me ,COMMA who began with being a molecular biologist in pasteur institute ,COMMA and found their way to the mountains .PERIOD 
i just wrote an essay on happiness ,COMMA and there was a controversy .PERIOD 
as pascal said ,COMMA even the one who hangs himself ,COMMA somehow ,COMMA is looking for cessation of suffering - he finds no other way .PERIOD 
although we want to avoid suffering ,COMMA it seems we are running somewhat towards it .PERIOD 
and that can also come from some kind of confusions .PERIOD 
it is something that - changes of nature .PERIOD 
it is a deep sense of serenity and fulfillment ,COMMA a state that actually pervades and underlies all emotional states ,COMMA and all the joys and sorrows that can come one's way .PERIOD 
can we have this kind of well-being while being sad ?QUESTIONMARK in a way ,COMMA why not ?QUESTIONMARK 
but there's also wicked joy ,COMMA you can rejoice in someone's suffering .PERIOD 
we know ,COMMA by experience ,COMMA that we can be what we call a little paradise ,COMMA and yet ,COMMA be completely unhappy within .PERIOD 
the experience that translates everything is within the mind .PERIOD 
we have to know from ourselves ,COMMA there are certain states of mind that are conducive to this flourishing ,COMMA to this well-being ,COMMA what the greeks called eudaimonia ,COMMA flourishing .PERIOD 
just the mere fact of doing that fills such a sense of adequation with our deep nature .PERIOD 
for that we have to ask ,COMMA what is nature of mind ?QUESTIONMARK 
and if we look from the experiential point of view ,COMMA there is a primary quality of consciousness that's just the mere fact to be cognitive ,COMMA to be aware .PERIOD 
usually ,COMMA when we feel annoyed ,COMMA hatred or upset with someone ,COMMA or obsessed with something ,COMMA the mind goes again and again to that object .PERIOD 
but we think we could sit on the cloud - but if you go there ,COMMA it's just mist .PERIOD 
mind transformation - that is the very meaning of meditation .PERIOD 
so that's what those great meditators have been doing .PERIOD 
if you are happy about something ,COMMA you'll go more to the left side .PERIOD 
here ,COMMA the <NUM> is the full standard deviation of a meditator who meditated on compassion .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i've no time to go into all the different scientific results .PERIOD 
some meditators ,COMMA without trying to stop it ,COMMA but simply by being completely open ,COMMA thinking that that bang is just going to be just a small event like a shooting star ,COMMA they are able not to move at all .PERIOD 
so the whole point of that is not ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA to make ,COMMA like ,COMMA a circus thing of showing exceptional beings who can jump ,COMMA or whatever .PERIOD 
we are ready to spend <NUM> years achieving education .PERIOD 
i'm not going to show you a presentation .PERIOD i'm going to talk to you .PERIOD 
the thing that was always striking to me was that we as people could have so many really amazing ideas about things we'd like to do ,COMMA but are so often unable ,COMMA in the real world ,COMMA to actually do those things - to actually cobble together the materials and go through the actual execution phase of building something that you imagine from a design perspective .PERIOD 
it's going to be different than here .PERIOD 
to give you an idea of scale ,COMMA second life is about <NUM> cpus at this point .PERIOD 
and let me justify that with two statements .PERIOD 
and i think that's something that people have talked about for <NUM> years - you know ,COMMA that <NUM> ,COMMA that lifelike environments are really important in some magical way to us .PERIOD 
second life originally had <NUM> simulators .PERIOD it now has <NUM> .PERIOD 
and we had - we zoned it ,COMMA you know :COLON we put a nightclub ,COMMA we put a disco where you could dance ,COMMA and then we had a place where you could fight with guns if you wanted to ,COMMA and we had another place that was like a boardwalk ,COMMA kind of a coney island .PERIOD 
and so the existence of an economy is critical .PERIOD 
the question is ,COMMA there appears to be a lack of cultural fine-tuning in second life .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA the multicultural nature and the sort of cultural melting pot that's happening inside second life is quite - i think ,COMMA quite remarkable relative to what in real human terms in the real world we've ever been able to achieve .PERIOD 
other questions ?QUESTIONMARK right here .PERIOD 
what's your demographic ?QUESTIONMARK 
in terms of psychographic - oh ,COMMA men and women :COLON men and women are almost equally matched in second life ,COMMA so about <NUM> percent of the people online right now on second life are women .PERIOD 
in terms of psychographic ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the people in second life are remarkably dissimilar relative to what you might think ,COMMA when you go in and talk to them and meet them ,COMMA and i would ,COMMA you know ,COMMA challenge you to just do this and find out .PERIOD 
if you count ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA cities .PERIOD so - but i did - and i didn't do - i think i didn't do as well in school as i could have .PERIOD i think you're right .PERIOD 
yeah ,COMMA so let me restate that .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA you're saying that in the pamphlet there's a statement that we may come to prefer our digital selves to our real ones - our more malleable or manageable digital identities to our real identities - and that in fact ,COMMA much of human life and human experience may move into the digital realm .PERIOD 
that's a frightening change ,COMMA frightening disruption .PERIOD 
i guess ,COMMA and you're asking ,COMMA what do i think about that ?QUESTIONMARK how do i - jh :COLON what's your response to the people who would say ,COMMA that's horrifying ?QUESTIONMARK 
now ,COMMA the problem of human diversity ,COMMA like all big scientific questions - how do you explain something like that - can be broken down into sub-questions .PERIOD 
what we're asking about though is human ancestry .PERIOD 
digging things up out of the ground ,COMMA and largely on the basis of morphology - the way things are shaped ,COMMA often skull shape - saying ,COMMA this looks a little bit more like us than that ,COMMA so this must be my ancestor .PERIOD 
you think you've got a tough job ?QUESTIONMARK 
now ,COMMA a quick primer on dna .PERIOD 
mitochondrial dna ,COMMA tracing a purely maternal line of descent .PERIOD 
turn them on their sides ,COMMA combine them so that they look like a tree with the root at the bottom and the branches going up .PERIOD 
was it millions of years ago ,COMMA which we might suspect by looking at all this incredible variation around the world ?QUESTIONMARK 
why was it that we seem to have come out of africa so recently ?QUESTIONMARK 
what was going on to the world's weather around <NUM> years ago ?QUESTIONMARK 
the reason for that is that ice actually sucks moisture out of the atmosphere .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists or physical anthropologists in the audience ,COMMA basically there's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA you want the ultimate african success story ?QUESTIONMARK 
look in the mirror .PERIOD you're it .PERIOD the reason you're alive today is because of those changes in our brains that took place in africa - probably somewhere in the region where we're sitting right now ,COMMA around <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> thousand years ago - allowing us not only to survive in africa ,COMMA but to expand out of africa .PERIOD 
these would have been savannah hunters .PERIOD 
entering europe around <NUM> years ago ,COMMA and finally ,COMMA a small group migrating up through the worst weather imaginable ,COMMA siberia ,COMMA inside the arctic circle ,COMMA during the last ice age - temperature was at <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA even <NUM> ,COMMA perhaps - migrating into the americas ,COMMA ultimately reaching that final frontier .PERIOD 
the changes that allowed us to do that ,COMMA the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us ,COMMA allowing us to create novel cultures ,COMMA allowing us to develop the diversity that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one i've just been on .PERIOD 
the field research that we're doing around the world with indigenous peoples .PERIOD 
the human genome project ,COMMA or a mars rover mission .PERIOD 
in this case ,COMMA you actually can .PERIOD 
and you'll now see the yolk and the white have separated .PERIOD 
and we all know in our heart of hearts that this is not the way the universe works .PERIOD 
and yet ,COMMA look around us .PERIOD 
now we move forward <NUM> years .PERIOD 
but that's not completely true .PERIOD 
recent studies by satellites such as the wmap satellite have shown that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA there are just tiny differences in that background .PERIOD 
we have our first stars .PERIOD 
so we've crossed a fourth threshold of complexity .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it copies itself and scatters the templates through the ocean .PERIOD 
and that's why ,COMMA as a species ,COMMA we're so creative and so powerful ,COMMA and that's why we have a history .PERIOD 
and then from about <NUM> years ago ,COMMA humans began to link up globally through shipping ,COMMA through trains ,COMMA through telegraph ,COMMA through the internet ,COMMA until now we seem to form a single global brain of almost seven billion individuals .PERIOD 
we've been on a journey ,COMMA a return journey ,COMMA of <NUM> billion years .PERIOD

collective learning is a very ,COMMA very powerful force ,COMMA and it's not clear that we humans are in charge of it .PERIOD 
the program ,COMMA in a sense ,COMMA is an example of behavioral finance on steroids - how we could really use behavioral finance .PERIOD 
how many of you have iphones ?QUESTIONMARK 
and that's what i really want to focus on today .PERIOD 
and what i'm going to talk about today is save more tomorrow .PERIOD 
first thing to notice is ,COMMA half of them do not even have access to a <NUM> plan .PERIOD

we're going to talk about what happens if people are overwhelmed and scared to make their <NUM> choices .PERIOD 
they're really mad .PERIOD 
we first implemented it ,COMMA richard thaler and i ,COMMA back in <NUM> .PERIOD 
we invited them to save three percentage points more every time they get a pay raise .PERIOD

this song is called fingertips .PERIOD 
this is eleanor roosevelt .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA i think we're going to stop that part of the show .PERIOD 
here's a song we like to think of as the future anthem of ted .PERIOD 
and the third said ,COMMA let's find another director .PERIOD 
so how many people who saw the film did not get that here was a woman in love ,COMMA that she was completely innocent and saw great joy in her life ,COMMA and she was youthful ?QUESTIONMARK 
and how many of you did not get that ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's a symbolic gesture .PERIOD i tear up the script ,COMMA i go and i panic myself ,COMMA i get scared .PERIOD 
get rid of your mind .PERIOD 
in delhi ,COMMA we used to live - we used to call it a chhat or the khota .PERIOD 
and i don't know why ,COMMA but i remember the story .PERIOD 
there was a woodcutter who's about to take his ax and chop a piece of wood ,COMMA and the whole galaxy is one atom of that ax .PERIOD 
and when that ax hits that piece of wood ,COMMA that's when everything will destroy and the big bang will happen again .PERIOD 
but all before that there was a woodcutter .PERIOD 
so every time ,COMMA i could tell my story again and again and get over this problem ,COMMA and so i got over the problem .PERIOD 
if we do not create the stories ,COMMA we probably go mad .PERIOD 
are you with child ?QUESTIONMARK 
you ask my permission before you rut ,COMMA before you breed .PERIOD 
elizabeth :COLON this man has seduced a ward of the queen ,COMMA and she has married without royal consent .PERIOD 
remember the word i said ,COMMA suck up .PERIOD 
but i can go on about telling you how we evolve stories ,COMMA and how stories effectively are who we are and how these get translated into the particular discipline that i am in ,COMMA which is film .PERIOD 
we're born for them .PERIOD 
the children's television host mr. rogers always carried in his wallet a quote from a social worker that said ,COMMA frankly ,COMMA there isn't anyone you couldn't learn to love once you've heard their story .PERIOD 
and the way i like to interpret that is probably the greatest story commandment ,COMMA which is make me care - please ,COMMA emotionally ,COMMA intellectually ,COMMA aesthetically ,COMMA just make me care .PERIOD 
and so if i were going to give you the ending of this story ,COMMA it would go something like this :COLON and that's what ultimately led me to speaking to you here at ted about story .PERIOD 
he insisted ,COMMA no embalming ,COMMA no open coffin ,COMMA no funeral .PERIOD 
it didn't happen to me ,COMMA it happened to somebody else ,COMMA but it's going to be worth your time .PERIOD 
♫ and that is all ♫ ♫ that love's about ♫ ♫ and we'll recall ♫ ♫ when time runs out ♫ ♫ that it only ♫ as :COLON storytelling without dialogue .PERIOD 
it confirmed something i really had a hunch on ,COMMA is that the audience actually wants to work for their meal .PERIOD 
and it's something that always drove all his choices .PERIOD 
wall-e's was to find the beauty .PERIOD 
sometimes you can make some horrible choices with them .PERIOD 
but a major threshold is passed when you mature enough to acknowledge what drives you and to take the wheel and steer it .PERIOD 
and that's why change is fundamental in story .PERIOD 
and it's interesting to see how that led us places that were actually pretty good .PERIOD 
and we got a hold of that fax .PERIOD 
and when an artist does that to another artist ,COMMA it's like you're compelled to pass it on .PERIOD 
i was going to help alleviate poverty .PERIOD 
we paid two to three times more than anybody else .PERIOD 
we may have some innovative ,COMMA new ideas .PERIOD 
there's no more of it .PERIOD 
this is where we stand today .PERIOD 
and then we need to use less again .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA so let's be generous .PERIOD 
how do you evaluate all the scientific data around a product ,COMMA the data that's changing on a weekly ,COMMA if not a daily ,COMMA basis ?QUESTIONMARK 
how is a consumer going to walk through this minefield ?QUESTIONMARK 
these are the <NUM> commodities that fundamentally pose the biggest threats to these places because of deforestation ,COMMA soil loss ,COMMA water use ,COMMA pesticide use ,COMMA over-fishing ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
are we going to work with <NUM> billion producers ?QUESTIONMARK 
if we work with those ,COMMA if we change those companies and the way they do business ,COMMA then the rest will happen automatically .PERIOD 
because if these companies demand sustainable products ,COMMA they'll pull <NUM> to <NUM> percent of production .PERIOD 
by companies asking for this ,COMMA we can leverage production so much faster than by waiting for consumers to do it .PERIOD 
after <NUM> years ,COMMA the global organic movement has achieved <NUM> of one percent of global food .PERIOD 
we can't wait that long .PERIOD 
we need change that's going to accelerate .PERIOD 
so it's the demand that brings them to the table .PERIOD 
so we're pulling out all the stops .PERIOD 
they're doing it with ibm and the usda ,COMMA and they're putting it in the public domain because they want everybody to have access to this data ,COMMA because they want everybody to help them make cocoa more productive and more sustainable .PERIOD 
if you divide the amount of water into what the farmer was paid ,COMMA the farmer didn't receive enough money to pay a decent price for water in any of those commodities .PERIOD 
this is called bundling .PERIOD it's bringing those externalities back into the price of the commodity .PERIOD 
we can't just focus on identifying the best ;SEMICOLON we've got to move the rest .PERIOD 
and i'm honored to meet you ,COMMA the future leaders of great britain and this world .PERIOD 
and my mother ,COMMA the most important role model in my life ,COMMA who lives with us at the white house and helps to care for our two little daughters ,COMMA malia and sasha .PERIOD 
that's why all of this that you're going through - the ups and the downs ,COMMA the teachers that you love and the teachers that you don't - why it's so important .PERIOD 
and having done so ,COMMA these women moved many obstacles .PERIOD 
i liked being smart .PERIOD 
i liked being on time .PERIOD i liked getting my work done .PERIOD 
history proves that it doesn't matter whether you come from a council estate or a country estate .PERIOD 
in the white house ,COMMA there's the desk that he sits at - it's called the resolute desk .PERIOD 
she is a world-class soprano singer who studied in rochester ,COMMA new york .PERIOD 
for me ,COMMA the human voice is the vessel on which all emotions travel - except perhaps jealousy .PERIOD 
when you're totally in the moment ,COMMA when i'm totally in the moment ,COMMA the vessel of expression is open .PERIOD 
the emotions can flow from me to you and back .PERIOD 
it's called aria .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA there are different colors and each color gets a different type of singing - pop ,COMMA country and western ,COMMA opera ,COMMA jazz - and you just have to be consistent with that color .PERIOD 
they had one great limitation and one great freedom as they tried to conceive of a global network .PERIOD 
so unusual ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA that it was said that it's not clear the internet could work .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA of course ,COMMA in a mosh pit it's hard to specify a destination .PERIOD 
this is a system that relies on kindness and trust ,COMMA which also makes it very delicate and vulnerable .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA for example ,COMMA last year ,COMMA the government of pakistan asked its internet service providers there to prevent citizens of pakistan from seeing youtube .PERIOD 
and here is the message where one of them says ,COMMA looks like we've got a live one .PERIOD we have a hijacking of youtube !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
and today ,COMMA wikipedia is so ubiquitous that you can now find it on chinese restaurant menus .PERIOD 
i am not making this up .PERIOD 
and there are a bunch of people who ,COMMA on a sunny day ,COMMA would rather be inside and monitoring this ,COMMA the administrator's notice board ,COMMA itself a wiki page that anyone can edit .PERIOD 
there are spambots crawling it ,COMMA trying to turn every article into an ad for a rolex watch .PERIOD 
it's something they feel impelled to do because they care about it .PERIOD 
here is just a snapshot of some of them .PERIOD 
if you do ,COMMA it will be removed immediately ,COMMA removed by people who may have disagreed with the original decision ,COMMA but respect the outcome and work to make it stay because they believe in something bigger than their own opinion .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA this is a <NUM> business week cover .PERIOD 
yeah ,COMMA i know .PERIOD number four ,COMMA it's like ,COMMA can you imagine coming home to that cat everyday ?QUESTIONMARK 
this one says ,COMMA bucolic meadow with split-rail fence .PERIOD 
and then have technology that the person taking the photo will know later ,COMMA this person requested to be contacted before this goes anywhere big ,COMMA if you don't mind .PERIOD 
and that person taking the photo can make a decision about how and whether to respect it .PERIOD 
and we now have means that we can build ,COMMA like this system ,COMMA so that people can report the filtering as they encounter it .PERIOD 
why ?QUESTIONMARK there is the craigslist rideshare board .PERIOD 
if it were called the craigslist hitchhiking board ,COMMA tumbleweeds would be blowing through it .PERIOD 
but it's the rideshare board ,COMMA and it's basically the same thing .PERIOD 
it's a bee that ,COMMA yes ,COMMA flies .PERIOD 
we all live in the same planet ,COMMA but there's still a great deal of poverty in the world .PERIOD 
and by and large ,COMMA this has failed .PERIOD 
aid actually did the opposite .PERIOD 
so <NUM> years ago ,COMMA i was trying to be an investment banker in new york .PERIOD 
and it reminded me of a day in <NUM> .PERIOD 
and after all ,COMMA poor countries ,COMMA like rich countries ,COMMA one thing we've got equal ,COMMA is their days are the same length :COLON <NUM> hours .PERIOD 
the question was ,COMMA how much did it cost to install a new telephone in bangladesh ?QUESTIONMARK 
it turns out :COLON <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA if the cost of installing a telephone is going down ,COMMA because there's a digital revolution going on ,COMMA then it would be even more dramatic .PERIOD 
but in any event ,COMMA it's connectivity that leads to dependability .PERIOD 
there were a lot of reasons people told me why we don't have enough telephones .PERIOD 
the work pays them a salary ;SEMICOLON the salary allows them to pay for the car over time .PERIOD 
the car pays for itself .PERIOD 
see ,COMMA you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing .PERIOD 
for instance ,COMMA the internet was booming in the u.s .PERIOD 
and she sells the milk to the villagers ,COMMA and pays off the loan .PERIOD 
and these phones are generating about <NUM> million dollars for the company .PERIOD 
it's just an experiment .PERIOD 
i was a guest student during one month of a public health course .PERIOD 
they read the textbook twice ,COMMA or three times or four times .PERIOD 
and they were the first to twitter transatlantically .PERIOD 
those are nice words .PERIOD but i got sort of curious of what he meant with liberty ,COMMA and liberty for whom .PERIOD 
but really ,COMMA really natural sovereignty was good for japan .PERIOD 
in <NUM> india finally gained its independence .PERIOD 
you can see that the health started to improve .PERIOD 
in <NUM> india follows with a market reform .PERIOD 
and they go quite closely together ,COMMA and you can see that the similarity with india and china ,COMMA in many ways ,COMMA are greater than the differences with them .PERIOD 
kerala is flying on top there ,COMMA matching united states in health ,COMMA but not in economy .PERIOD 
we have an enormous disparity in the world .PERIOD 
you see ,COMMA china under foreign domination actually lowered their income and came down to the indian level here .PERIOD 
japan did it like this ,COMMA until full catch up ,COMMA and then they follow with the other high-income economies .PERIOD 
can be worse ,COMMA can be better .PERIOD 
but more recently ,COMMA i've been turning my attention to the universe on the largest scale .PERIOD 
by invisible ,COMMA i mean it doesn't absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum .PERIOD 
when those measurements are made ,COMMA instead what we find is that the speed is basically constant ,COMMA as a function of distance .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA this galaxy and every other galaxy appears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter .PERIOD 
it would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA how do we deduce where the galaxy is ?QUESTIONMARK 
where will this observer see the galaxy ?QUESTIONMARK 
so there's a whole ray of light - rays of light on a cone - that will all be bent by that cluster and make it into the observer's eye .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA actually ,COMMA at home ,COMMA whenever we break a wineglass ,COMMA i save the bottom ,COMMA take it over to the machine shop .PERIOD 
we shave it off ,COMMA and i have a little gravitational lens ,COMMA ok .PERIOD 
and we see these gravitational lensing effects ,COMMA these distortions that say that ,COMMA again ,COMMA clusters are embedded in dark matter .PERIOD 
they're moving away from each other because space itself is getting bigger ,COMMA ok .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA in the last century ,COMMA ok ,COMMA people debated about whether this expansion of space would continue forever ;SEMICOLON whether it would slow down ,COMMA you know ,COMMA will be slowing down ,COMMA but continue forever ;SEMICOLON slow down and stop ,COMMA asymptotically stop ;SEMICOLON or slow down ,COMMA stop ,COMMA and then reverse ,COMMA so it starts to contract again .PERIOD 
by how much less is it expanding today ,COMMA compared to ,COMMA say ,COMMA a couple of billion years ago ?QUESTIONMARK 
so we need something to be able to explain that .PERIOD 
but we don't know if either of those are actually the dark matter candidate ,COMMA ok .PERIOD 
they haven't seen anything ,COMMA ok ,COMMA but it puts limits on what the mass and the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are .PERIOD 
there's going to be a satellite telescope launched later this year and it will look towards the middle of the galaxy ,COMMA to see if we can see dark matter particles annihilating and producing gamma rays that could be detected with this .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA there is a lot of new physics whose signature could be missing energy ,COMMA so it will be hard to tell the difference .PERIOD 
and finally ,COMMA for future endeavors ,COMMA there are telescopes being designed specifically to address the questions of dark matter and dark energy - ground-based telescopes ,COMMA and there are three space-based telescopes that are in competition right now to be launched to investigate dark matter and dark energy .PERIOD 
and over the course of half an hour ,COMMA not one syringe was filmed being unwrapped .PERIOD 
they started with two and they ended with two .PERIOD 
in china ,COMMA recycling is a major issue .PERIOD 
and they use them ,COMMA in the breaks ,COMMA for water pistols .PERIOD 
and they are having great fun .PERIOD 
and they squirt the water into their mouths .PERIOD 
you load it up in the normal way .PERIOD this is made on existing equipment in <NUM> factories that we license .PERIOD 
imagine that orchestration .PERIOD 
this happens every year .PERIOD 
and one time he came up to me - he was about seven or eight years old - he came up to me .PERIOD 
and there was a wasp's nest that i had let grow in my yard ,COMMA right outside my door .PERIOD 
and like ,COMMA knock like a woodpecker on my door until i opened it up .PERIOD 
and i told him ,COMMA you know ,COMMA cody ,COMMA the wasps actually made that .PERIOD 
they're the people who make the bullet train .PERIOD 
and those bumps act like a magnet for water .PERIOD 
and the fog comes in and it builds up on the tips .PERIOD 
now it's reversing that equation ,COMMA and actually sequestering half a ton of co2 thanks to the recipe from the coral .PERIOD 
they actually export water molecules through .PERIOD 
and those scalloped edges play with flow in such a way that is reduces drag by <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
the question is - biomimicry is an incredibly powerful way to innovate .PERIOD 
and we are in a long ,COMMA long line of organisms to come to this planet and ask ourselves ,COMMA how can we live here gracefully over the long haul ?QUESTIONMARK 
now in order to do this ,COMMA the design challenge of our century ,COMMA i think ,COMMA we need a way to remind ourselves of those geniuses ,COMMA and to somehow meet them again .PERIOD 
and we're working with eol ,COMMA encyclopedia of life ,COMMA ed wilson's ted wish .PERIOD 
and this is a pretty well-educated audience ,COMMA so i imagine you all know something about aids .PERIOD 
if you know something more ,COMMA you probably know that uganda ,COMMA to date ,COMMA is the only country in sub-saharan africa that has had success in combating the epidemic .PERIOD 
but i'm going to use tools and ideas that are familiar to economists to think about a problem that's more traditionally part of public health and epidemiology .PERIOD 
we see almost no change in sexual behavior .PERIOD 
aids is the same kind of thing .PERIOD it's costly to avoid aids .PERIOD 
and the way that i'm going to do that is ,COMMA i'm going to look across areas with different levels of malaria .PERIOD 
and so people who live in areas with a lot of malaria are going to have lower life expectancy than people who live in areas with limited malaria .PERIOD 
even if you only cared about aids in africa ,COMMA it might still be a good idea to invest in malaria ,COMMA in combating poor indoor air quality ,COMMA in improving maternal mortality rates .PERIOD 
if people have no incentive to avoid aids on their own ,COMMA even if they know everything about the disease ,COMMA they still may not change their behavior .PERIOD 
we know they had this campaign .PERIOD that's how we learn about what works .PERIOD 
so this is another way to see this .PERIOD 
so i am going to talk about exports and prices .PERIOD 
but openness and inter-connectedness ,COMMA it comes with a cost when we think about disease .PERIOD i don't think this should be a surprise .PERIOD 
areas with a lot of economic activity - with a lot of roads ,COMMA with a lot of urbanization - those areas have higher prevalence than others .PERIOD 
and what's really ,COMMA really great about being here is i'm sure that the questions that you guys have are very ,COMMA very different than the questions that i think up myself .PERIOD 
it's great being here at ted .PERIOD 
their relationship is a love story that feeds the earth .PERIOD 
it reminds us that we are a part of nature ,COMMA and we're not separate from it .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA their answer was ,COMMA it's all about risk and reward .PERIOD 
and chip taylor ,COMMA our monarch butterfly expert ,COMMA he replied ,COMMA nothing lasts forever .PERIOD 
and that blew my mind .PERIOD 
we were four girls and no boys .PERIOD 
out of <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> are your creation .PERIOD 
this is about tough policing ,COMMA equal policing .PERIOD 
i now went to a prison assignment as a police officer .PERIOD 
here i got a prison assignment .PERIOD 
obviously ,COMMA it was .PERIOD 
and then how did i deal with them ?QUESTIONMARK 
the first day when i went in ,COMMA i didn't know how to look at them .PERIOD 
i said ,COMMA do you pray ?QUESTIONMARK do you want to pray ?QUESTIONMARK 
i think that's the bigger change .PERIOD 
teachers were prisoners .PERIOD teachers were volunteers .PERIOD 
you want to know more about this ,COMMA go and see this film ,COMMA doing time ,COMMA doing vipassana .PERIOD 
let me wrap it up .PERIOD 
but the best part is the message that the yahoo help desk got about <NUM> minutes later .PERIOD 
captcha project is something that we did here at carnegie melllon over <NUM> years ago ,COMMA and it's been used everywhere .PERIOD 
so then i started feeling bad .PERIOD 
so can we get you to do useful work for those <NUM> seconds ?QUESTIONMARK 
so you start with a book ,COMMA and then you scan it .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA for things that were written more than <NUM> years ago ,COMMA the computer cannot recognize about <NUM> percent of the words .PERIOD 
johnedwards.com so we keep on insulting people left and right everyday .PERIOD 
there are tens of thousands of these .PERIOD 
some of them are very cute .PERIOD 
and it is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda .PERIOD 
it hasn't yet been launched .PERIOD it's called duolingo .PERIOD 
it started with me posing a question to my graduate student ,COMMA severin hacker .PERIOD 
actually it was a forum post .PERIOD 
remember ,COMMA it's a question about javascript .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA so computer translation ,COMMA not yet good enough .PERIOD 
we could pay professional language translators to translate the whole web .PERIOD 
we could do that .PERIOD 
if we wanted to translate the other <NUM> percent into spanish ,COMMA it would cost at least <NUM> million dollars - and this is at even the most exploited ,COMMA outsourcing country out there .PERIOD 
so it would be very expensive .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA in the united states alone ,COMMA there are over five million people who have paid over $ <NUM> for software to learn a new language .PERIOD 
there's ,COMMA of course ,COMMA a lot of very simple sentences on the web .PERIOD 
since all the projects that my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users ,COMMA we're hopeful that we'll be able to translate extremely fast with this project .PERIOD 
so here's the site .PERIOD 
but then by the end of the decade ,COMMA the country had fallen back into political instability and mismanagement .PERIOD 
we the children had gathered at a friend's house .PERIOD 
i wanted to document on film the <NUM> presidential elections .PERIOD 
and there ,COMMA i started by searching for the footprints in my childhood .PERIOD 
the polling stations opened to the voters at <NUM> am ,COMMA but voters ,COMMA eager to take their own political fate into their hands ,COMMA were starting to line up at <NUM> am in the morning .PERIOD 
they were chanting ,COMMA we want peace .PERIOD 
now the uphill battle for ghana and for africa is not over ,COMMA but i have proof that the other side of democracy exists ,COMMA and that we must not take it for granted .PERIOD 
that - you know ,COMMA i was born thinking about things that way ,COMMA and i had always been like a little scientist guy .PERIOD 
and people in the <NUM> century ,COMMA they didn't really understand the same way we do about you know ,COMMA this stuff is a bunch of different kinds of molecules ,COMMA and we breathe it in for a purpose and all that .PERIOD 
and boyle said ,COMMA bullshit .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA charles said ,COMMA i'm going to put up the money give you guys a building ,COMMA come here and you can meet in the building ,COMMA but just don't talk about religion in there .PERIOD 
but experimental science had been tied up with all those things .PERIOD 
kary mullis :COLON they might have done it for the teddy bear ,COMMA yeah .PERIOD 
i thought that anybody with any brains will do it that way .PERIOD 
i was thinking about making my own little rockets .PERIOD 
that's why i thought ,COMMA as long as i don't blow my eyes out .PERIOD 
i may not care about the fact that it's prohibited from heating this solution .PERIOD 
i'm sure it's got to do with rockets or it wouldn't be in that manual .PERIOD 
and it - they burned .PERIOD 
at any rate ,COMMA i bring it up because it's a good story ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA tell personal things ,COMMA you know ,COMMA and that's a personal - i was going to tell you about the first night that i met my wife ,COMMA but that would be too personal ,COMMA wouldn't it .PERIOD 
but in the actual process ,COMMA you get an idea - like ,COMMA when i got the idea one night that i could amplify dna with two oligonucleotides ,COMMA and i could make lots of copies of some little piece of dna ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the thinking for that was about <NUM> minutes while i was driving my car ,COMMA and then instead of going - i went back and i did talk to people about it ,COMMA but if i'd listened to what i heard from all my friends who were molecular biologists - i would have abandoned it .PERIOD 
but i knew ,COMMA you'd go into the lab and you'd try to make it work yourself .PERIOD and then you're the authority ,COMMA and you can say ,COMMA i know it works ,COMMA because right there in that tube is where it happened ,COMMA and here ,COMMA on this gel ,COMMA there's a little band there that i know that's dna ,COMMA and that's the dna i wanted to amplify ,COMMA so there !EXCLAMATIONMARK so it does work .PERIOD 
so you have to be honest .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA let's see .PERIOD 
they made bigger guns to shoot them down with .PERIOD 
and the people i'm talking about are people that like - they say that they're a member of the committee called ,COMMA say ,COMMA the inter-governmental panel on climate change .PERIOD 
so the planet should get warmer .PERIOD 
so the planet is a pretty amazing thing ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's big and horrible - and big and wonderful ,COMMA and it does all kinds of things we don't know anything about .PERIOD 
in new york city ,COMMA rats are part of commuters' daily lives .PERIOD 
i was very fond of this space because it's the first massive industrial complex i found on my own that is abandoned .PERIOD 
the nature had really reclaimed the whole complex .PERIOD 
i was really frightened at first ,COMMA but i calmly explained to him that i was working on an art project and he didn't seem to mind and so i went ahead and put my camera on self-timer and ran back and forth .PERIOD 
that homeless man ,COMMA to me ,COMMA really represented an element of the unconscious of the city .PERIOD 
they were consistently dug as limestone quarries and by the <NUM> century ,COMMA the caving-in of some of these quarries posed safety threats ,COMMA so the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries and dug new observation tunnels in order to monitor and map the whole place .PERIOD 
as you can see ,COMMA the system is very complex and vast .PERIOD 
i'm going to try and explain why it is that perhaps we don't understand as much as we think we do .PERIOD 
i think we agree on that .PERIOD where does the tree get the stuff that makes up this chair ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK where does all this stuff come from ?QUESTIONMARK 
and would you be able to ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA draw a - you don't have to draw the diagram ,COMMA but would you be able to draw the diagram ,COMMA if you had to do it ?QUESTIONMARK or would you just say ,COMMA that's actually not possible ?QUESTIONMARK 
that's what plants actually do for a living .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA these mental models - we look for evidence that reinforces our models .PERIOD 
and it's amateur ,COMMA but amateur in the best sense ,COMMA in other words ,COMMA the root of the word being of love and passion .PERIOD 
and governments do very well .PERIOD they pat themselves on the back .PERIOD 
ok ?QUESTIONMARK we collude ,COMMA and actually if you - if someone had designed a test for me when i was doing my biology exams ,COMMA to really understand ,COMMA to see whether i'd understood more than just kind of putting starch and iodine together and seeing it go blue ,COMMA and really understood that plants took their mass out of the air ,COMMA then i might have done better at science .PERIOD 
i love manipulating the infrastructure of biology .PERIOD 
but within that infrastructure ,COMMA we have to remember that the driving force of biology is really coming from evolution .PERIOD 
this is a dead crystal ,COMMA and i'm going to do something to it ,COMMA and it's going to become alive .PERIOD 
but there's a problem ,COMMA because up until maybe a decade ago ,COMMA we were told that life was impossible and that we were the most incredible miracle in the universe .PERIOD 
if we can make matter alive ,COMMA would we have a matterhazard ?QUESTIONMARK 
chemists are trying to study the molecules to look at disease .PERIOD 
you can decode the genome ,COMMA you can look back ,COMMA you can link us all together by a mitochondrial dna ,COMMA but we can't get further than the last ancestor ,COMMA the last visible cell that we could sequence or think back in history .PERIOD 
what is life ?QUESTIONMARK what is this stuff of life ?QUESTIONMARK 
so the whole area's been stuck for a while ,COMMA and it got reignited in the <NUM> when analytical technologies and computer technologies were coming on .PERIOD 
and the answer ,COMMA of course ,COMMA lies with mice .PERIOD 
they're all made of the same stuff ,COMMA but they want their shape to win .PERIOD 
and that is the key .PERIOD 
let's zoom out to what that could mean .PERIOD 
if we could get evolution into the material world ,COMMA then i propose we should have a general theory of evolution .PERIOD 
and that's really worth thinking about .PERIOD 
so that means we could then start to develop different platforms for exploring this evolution .PERIOD 
but not only just that ,COMMA we will start to think about how we can start to develop a symbiotic relationship with biology .PERIOD 
evolution cannot be cut apart .PERIOD 
and we're really becoming very close to understanding the key steps that makes dead stuff come alive .PERIOD 
look here - you have to end poverty ,COMMA education ,COMMA gender ,COMMA child and maternal health ,COMMA control infections ,COMMA protect the environment and get the good global links between nations in every aspect from aid to trade .PERIOD 
that's a four percent reduction per year - and this ,COMMA with measuring .PERIOD 
i'll prove them wrong on both points .PERIOD 
and i will take kenya as an example .PERIOD 
i was actually ,COMMA on friday ,COMMA sitting in front of my computer ,COMMA and i saw the death rate fall from <NUM> to <NUM> just that morning .PERIOD 
that's unfair .PERIOD 
had i been in the ministry of health in kenya ,COMMA i may have joined these two points .PERIOD 
so look at the average here - this is the average for all of sub-saharan africa .PERIOD 
i give you congo ,COMMA which was high ,COMMA ghana - lower .PERIOD and kenya - even lower .PERIOD 
their countries are so different ,COMMA and they merit to be recognized in the same way ,COMMA as we don't talk about europe as one place .PERIOD 
there we are today .PERIOD 
look - even if we look in africa - these are the african countries .PERIOD 
it's very clear that this is what happens .PERIOD 
that is ,COMMA when we get girls in school ,COMMA we'll get an impact <NUM> to <NUM> years later ,COMMA which is a secular trend which is very strong .PERIOD 
it's a decent life for children ,COMMA we are talking about .PERIOD 
do we care about those four billion people whose income levels are less than two dollars a day ,COMMA the so-called bottom of the pyramid ?QUESTIONMARK 
but if you don't have money ,COMMA what happens ?QUESTIONMARK 
and if they do so ,COMMA then ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the conditions improve ,COMMA and they start riding on scooters .PERIOD 
an innovator is one who does not know it cannot be done .PERIOD 
they combine all that .PERIOD 
and it was that compassion which bothered them ,COMMA because when he saw - in fact ,COMMA he told me about eight or nine years ago how he was driving his own car - he drives his own car by the way - and he saw in the rain ,COMMA a family like the one that i showed to you getting drenched with an infant .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA how we started :COLON ratan just began with a five-engineer team ,COMMA young people in their mid-twenties .PERIOD 
it was an open innovation ,COMMA ideas from all over were welcome .PERIOD 
and the seat riser ,COMMA for example ,COMMA serving as a mounting for the seat as well as a structural part of the functional rigidity .PERIOD 
and british motor was around <NUM> .PERIOD 
and unbelievably ,COMMA in <NUM> years ,COMMA i was the first indian to be honored .PERIOD 
are you getting more drugs because you are spending more time and more money ?QUESTIONMARK 
the ideas have to be such that you think in completely different terms .PERIOD 
and incubator costs <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
but then he held it for a little while ,COMMA lakshmi .PERIOD 
that gave me a great message :COLON focus and you can achieve .PERIOD 
and currently i'm president of global research alliance ,COMMA <NUM> scientists in nine counties ,COMMA right from india to the u.s .PERIOD 
commodities are things that you grow in the ground ,COMMA raise on the ground or pull out of the ground :COLON basically ,COMMA animal ,COMMA mineral ,COMMA vegetable .PERIOD 
long-distance telephone service sold on price ,COMMA price ,COMMA price ;SEMICOLON fast-food restaurants with all their value pricing ;SEMICOLON and even the internet is commoditizing not just goods ,COMMA but services as well .PERIOD 
now most places that i talk to ,COMMA when i talk about experience ,COMMA i talk about disney - the world's premier experience-stager .PERIOD 
and then i always finish off by talking about - the thing that amazes me the most about this question ,COMMA particularly coming from the dutch ,COMMA is that the netherlands is every bit as manufactured as disneyland .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA you can look at how each of these economies developed ,COMMA that each one has their own business imperative ,COMMA matched with a consumer sensibility .PERIOD 
because all businesses are man-made objects ;SEMICOLON all business is involved with money ;SEMICOLON all business is a matter of using machinery ,COMMA and all those things make something inauthentic .PERIOD 
at the end of a laundry list of advice he's giving to his son ,COMMA laertes ,COMMA he says this :COLON and this above all :COLON to thine own self be true .PERIOD 
as businesses ,COMMA are the economic offerings you are providing - are they true to themselves ?QUESTIONMARK 
and of course ,COMMA if you are both true to yourself ,COMMA and are what you say you are ,COMMA then you're real real !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
universal city walk is a real fake - in fact ,COMMA we got this very term from ada louise huxtable's book ,COMMA the unreal america .PERIOD 
but is it really true to itself ?QUESTIONMARK 
so she calls it a real fake .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA understand what - your past limits what you can do in the future .PERIOD 
right ,COMMA if you could check into the ads ,COMMA you'd have a great experience .PERIOD 
then you have that perception that you are phony .PERIOD 
a few words about how i got started ,COMMA and it has a lot to do with happiness ,COMMA actually .PERIOD 
i would make things for people as a way of ,COMMA you know ,COMMA giving ,COMMA showing them my love .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it has to end with this - - gratuitous violence .PERIOD 
so that was how i first started to explore the way things moved ,COMMA and expressed it .PERIOD 
i was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery and becoming a surgeon ,COMMA because it meant working with my hands in a very focused ,COMMA intense way .PERIOD 
when i see objects ,COMMA i imagine them in motion .PERIOD 
that's about that big .PERIOD 
this kind of work is also very much like puppetry ,COMMA where the found object is ,COMMA in a sense ,COMMA the puppet ,COMMA and i'm the puppeteer at first ,COMMA because i'm playing with an object .PERIOD 
and they would coalesce for just a moment ,COMMA so you could perceive that there was a chair there .PERIOD 
what would i love ?QUESTIONMARK 
so this is a little wire-bending tool .PERIOD 
after many years of bending gears with a pair of pliers ,COMMA i made that tool ,COMMA and then i made this other tool for sort of centering gears very quickly - sort of developing my own little world of technology .PERIOD 
and the idea ,COMMA their premise was that we wanted to show pieces of sculpture on the street ,COMMA and there'd be no subjective decision about what was the best .PERIOD 
so i'll just let this chair come down .PERIOD 
and what we were going to do was scan a new project on the development of the fetus from conception to birth using these kinds of new technologies .PERIOD 
<NUM> days :COLON heart chamber developing <NUM> days :COLON arms & amp ;SEMICOLON hands are developing <NUM> days :COLON beginning of the primitive vertabrae these weeks are the period of the most rapid development of the fetus .PERIOD 
<NUM> days <NUM> days :COLON developing retina ,COMMA nose and fingers the fetus' continual movement in the womb is necessary for muscular and skeletal growth .PERIOD 
every six months until they're six years old - we're going to be doing actually to about <NUM> children - watching exactly how the gyri and the sulci of the brains fold to see how this magnificent development actually turns into memories and the marvel that is us .PERIOD 
i'm a spectroscopist .PERIOD 
sometimes we have to deal with just one tiny ,COMMA weak spectral line to measure the composition of that chemical element in the atmosphere .PERIOD 
for instance ,COMMA you see the spectral line of the gold is the only spectral line in the spectrum of the sun .PERIOD 
it's a heavy element produced in thermonuclear explosions of supernovae .PERIOD 
it's the only place where you can produce ,COMMA actually ,COMMA osmium .PERIOD 
it was incredible .PERIOD the only conclusion we could make from this is clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion in this system ,COMMA which polluted the atmosphere of this star .PERIOD 
they actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra is an alien .PERIOD it comes from a different galaxy .PERIOD 
and sometimes they just capture stars .PERIOD 
we were very surprised to discover a super flare ,COMMA a flare which is thousands of millions of times more powerful than those we see in the sun .PERIOD 
this can be done with the future spectrographs .PERIOD 
coming back to the most important question ,COMMA is there anybody out there ?QUESTIONMARK 
connection between life and radioactive nuclei is straightforward .PERIOD 
it's exactly the same game .PERIOD a very tiny feature .PERIOD 
it's amazing that we can detect vegetation from a spectrum .PERIOD 
now very recently ,COMMA very recently ,COMMA i'm talking about last six ,COMMA seven ,COMMA eight months ,COMMA water ,COMMA methane ,COMMA carbon dioxide have been detected in the spectrum of a planet outside the solar system .PERIOD 
and with the known physics etc ,COMMA it's something actually which has been pointed out by frank drake ,COMMA many years ago ,COMMA and shklovsky .PERIOD 
they want to actually signal their presence through these spectral lines ,COMMA in the spectrum of a star ,COMMA in different ways .PERIOD 
and we are doing this job since <NUM> and it's a very heavy project .PERIOD 
we have been working very hard .PERIOD 
i think it will come from a spectrum like this .PERIOD 
it will take about five years .PERIOD 
and she said ,COMMA but the thing i liked about your talk is you're a storyteller .PERIOD 
and she said ,COMMA i'm going to call you a storyteller .PERIOD 
i'm a qualitative researcher .PERIOD 
and maybe i'm just a storyteller .PERIOD 
the other thing that they had in common was this :COLON they fully embraced vulnerability .PERIOD 
they're willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out .PERIOD 
do you have any recommendations ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i said ,COMMA i'm great .PERIOD i'm okay .PERIOD 
i just need some strategies .PERIOD 
and then i said ,COMMA it's bad ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
the problem is - and i learned this from the research - that you cannot selectively numb emotion .PERIOD 
you can't numb those hard feelings without numbing the other affects ,COMMA our emotions .PERIOD 
religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty .PERIOD 
there's no conversation .PERIOD 
which just ,COMMA i hope in <NUM> years ,COMMA people will look back and go ,COMMA wow .PERIOD 
and when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand ,COMMA our job is not to say ,COMMA look at her ,COMMA she's perfect .PERIOD 
my job is just to keep her perfect - make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and yale by seventh grade .PERIOD 
we do that in our personal lives .PERIOD 
it is ,COMMA as you can see ,COMMA very small and also very cheap .PERIOD 
so that when we think about using them to get some systematic improvement ,COMMA we also think about how they can be useful for self-improvement ,COMMA for self-discovery ,COMMA self-awareness ,COMMA self-knowledge .PERIOD 
some people will say it's for public health research .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
i want to talk about it in the context of a story .PERIOD 
all of our statuses are different .PERIOD 
all of our hopes and dreams ,COMMA what we want to accomplish ,COMMA is different ,COMMA and our paths will be different ,COMMA they are all stories .PERIOD 
and go from this concept of walking ,COMMA breathing ,COMMA and then his hands ,COMMA speak ,COMMA and ultimately happiness and function .PERIOD 
and we took this ,COMMA and we converted it into data .PERIOD 
but it's not a data point at that one moment in time .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA here's steven alone ,COMMA sharing this story in the world .PERIOD 
we need to give to others to be successful .PERIOD 
and i'm going to show you what patients like me ,COMMA the company that myself ,COMMA my youngest brother and a good friend from mit started .PERIOD 
but you can aggregate this and you can discover things about treatments .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA you can see the duration .PERIOD 
i'm going to log in .PERIOD 
and this is a new version of our platform we're launching right now .PERIOD 
i'm taking three drugs to manage it .PERIOD some of them are experimental .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA can i take this data - rearrange yourself ,COMMA put the symptoms in the left ,COMMA the drugs across the top ,COMMA tell me everything we know about steven and everyone else ,COMMA and what interacts .PERIOD 
doctors actually love this sheet ,COMMA and they're actually really engaged .PERIOD 
ten percent of the people in our system took lithium .PERIOD 
it's never going to work .PERIOD you can't do it .PERIOD 
and then we say ,COMMA well how do we line them all up ?QUESTIONMARK 
and it works almost every time .PERIOD 
and yeah ,COMMA all the clinicians in the audience will talk about power and all the standard deviation .PERIOD we'll do that later .PERIOD 
we hired them ,COMMA set them up ,COMMA assisting at lab .PERIOD 
because something went different .PERIOD 
and i am thankful .PERIOD 
we know what they are .PERIOD 
the <NUM> iceberg broke off the ross ice shelf .PERIOD 
and what if we could get exquisite control over the essence of energy ,COMMA the electron ?QUESTIONMARK 
a tremendous amount of energy is coming at us from the sun .PERIOD 
wouldn't it be really great if the window could flick back the heat into the room if we needed it or flick it away before it came in ?QUESTIONMARK 
we'd have to see at night ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
but because it's flexible ,COMMA it can be on any surface whatsoever .PERIOD 
ebox is testing new nanomaterials to park an electron on the outside ,COMMA hold it until you need it ,COMMA and then be able to release it and pass it off .PERIOD 
<NUM> trillion dollars is what we're going to have to spend .PERIOD 
i'm glad to be working with incredibly brilliant and kind scientists ,COMMA no kinder than many of the people in the world ,COMMA but they have a magic look at the world .PERIOD 
by any standard this is wrong .PERIOD 
i was two years older than my sister at the time - i mean ,COMMA i'm two years older than her now - but at the time it meant she had to do everything that i wanted to do ,COMMA and i wanted to play war .PERIOD 
and on the other side were all my sister's my little ponies ready for a cavalry charge .PERIOD 
i was nervous because my parents had charged me with making sure that my sister and i played as safely and as quietly as possible .PERIOD 
.PERIOD with one broken leg .PERIOD 
i can delete that dot because that's clearly a measurement error .PERIOD 
so one of the very first things we teach people in economics and statistics and business and psychology courses is how ,COMMA in a statistically valid way ,COMMA do we eliminate the weirdos .PERIOD 
when i applied to harvard ,COMMA i applied on a dare .PERIOD 
i didn't expect to get in ,COMMA and my family had no money for college .PERIOD 
which i'm glad you liked ,COMMA but they did not like that at all .PERIOD 
here's how we get to health :COLON we need to reverse the formula for happiness and success .PERIOD 
doctors are <NUM> percent faster ,COMMA more accurate at coming up with the correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative ,COMMA neutral or stressed .PERIOD 
what we need to be able to do is to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of .PERIOD 
exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters .PERIOD 
and by the way ,COMMA all of these numbers are significantly higher if you happen to be black ,COMMA if you happen to be poor ,COMMA if you happen to exist in an overcrowded school .PERIOD 
and so we're starting to see the establishment of men centers and men studies to think about how do we engage men in their experiences in the university .PERIOD 
the next reason that boys' cultures are out of sync with school cultures :COLON there are fewer male teachers .PERIOD 
but male role models for boys that say it's all right to be smart - they've got dads ,COMMA they've got pastors ,COMMA they've got cub scout leaders ,COMMA but ultimately ,COMMA six hours a day ,COMMA five days a week they're spending in a classroom ,COMMA and most of those classrooms are not places where men exist .PERIOD 
this is a place for girls .PERIOD 
we have a serious compression of the curriculum happening out there .PERIOD 
and if you ask title <NUM> teachers ,COMMA they'll tell you they've got about four or five boys for every girl that's in their program ,COMMA in the elementary grades .PERIOD 
all of those conversations need to be happening .PERIOD 
who has a computer ?QUESTIONMARK yeah .PERIOD 
o.k .PERIOD so ,COMMA everyone has a computer .PERIOD 
i went to mit ,COMMA did my math ,COMMA but i had this wonderful opportunity ,COMMA because computers had just become visual .PERIOD 
remember that moment - publishing your designs ?QUESTIONMARK 
i didn't quite get it .PERIOD and paul rand was a kind of crusty designer ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a crusty designer ,COMMA like a good - kind of like a good french bread ?QUESTIONMARK 
this is the first sort of play thing i did ,COMMA my own serious play .PERIOD 
this is actually bad :COLON human experiments .PERIOD 
see ,COMMA humans don't know how to take orders ;SEMICOLON the computer's so good at it .PERIOD 
this guy figured out how to get the computer to draw with two pens at once :COLON you know ,COMMA you ,COMMA pen ,COMMA do this ,COMMA and you ,COMMA pen ,COMMA do this .PERIOD 
and after this i wanted to build a computer out of people ,COMMA called a human-powered computer .PERIOD 
i have behind this wall a disk drive ,COMMA a cpu ,COMMA a graphics card ,COMMA a memory system .PERIOD 
on the computer ,COMMA when you move your mouse ,COMMA that arrow moves around .PERIOD 
i have no staff ;SEMICOLON it's all kind of made by hand - these sort of broken hands .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA naomi was pivotal in that .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA if you can see here ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that program you're seeing in the corner ,COMMA if you spread it out ,COMMA it's all these things all at once .PERIOD 
you get it ?QUESTIONMARK no ?QUESTIONMARK o.k .PERIOD 
they're littler computers ,COMMA so the one-chip computers ,COMMA i began to program one-chip computers and make objects out of p.c .PERIOD boards ,COMMA leds .PERIOD 
i did a show in london last year made out of ipods - i used ipods as a material .PERIOD 
we have this gene defect in our mind .PERIOD 
this is from the cape last year .PERIOD 
this is also out there ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
and i went after it with passion .PERIOD 
i was ,COMMA like ,COMMA aha ,COMMA wait a second .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA thank you everyone .PERIOD 
what is it about flying cars ?QUESTIONMARK 
but we haven't yet gotten to the point where on your way here this morning you see something that really ,COMMA truly seamlessly integrates the two-dimensional world that we're comfortable in with the three-dimensional sky above us - that ,COMMA i don't know about you ,COMMA but i really enjoy spending time in .PERIOD 
for those of us that spend most of our lives on the ground ,COMMA this may be counter-intuitive ,COMMA but driving has potholes ,COMMA cobblestones ,COMMA pedestrians ,COMMA other drivers and a rather long and detailed list of federal motor vehicle safety standards to contend with .PERIOD 
you just push a few buttons in the cockpit ,COMMA and the wings come out .PERIOD 
radio <NUM> :COLON that was gorgeous .PERIOD 
the transition will cost in line with other small airplanes .PERIOD 
and i'm certainly not out to replace your chevy ,COMMA but i do think that the transition should be your next airplane .PERIOD 
and mobility to your destination is clearly solved .PERIOD 
the question was given to a bunch of engineers ,COMMA about <NUM> years ago ,COMMA how do we make the journey to paris better ?QUESTIONMARK 
what you should in fact do is employ all of the world's top male and female supermodels ,COMMA pay them to walk the length of the train ,COMMA handing out free chateau petrus for the entire duration of the journey .PERIOD 
they seem fantastic to me .PERIOD they cost very little to develop .PERIOD 
someone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further ,COMMA and actually produce placebo education .PERIOD 
before long ,COMMA there was a massive underground potato-growing operation in germany .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA boring people would have just simply banned the veil .PERIOD 
all value is perceived value .PERIOD 
these funny signs that flash your speed at you ,COMMA some of the new ones ,COMMA on the bottom right ,COMMA now actually show a smiley face or a frowny face ,COMMA to act as an emotional trigger .PERIOD 
the wealthy prussians ,COMMA to help in the war against the french ,COMMA were encouraged to give in all their jewelry .PERIOD 
the interesting thing is that for <NUM> years hence ,COMMA the highest status jewelry you could wear in prussia wasn't made of gold or diamonds .PERIOD 
it was made of cast iron .PERIOD 
because actually ,COMMA never mind the actual intrinsic value of having gold jewelry .PERIOD this actually had symbolic value ,COMMA badge value .PERIOD 
if you think about it ,COMMA shakerism was a proto-environmental movement .PERIOD 
and that what we add on top is kind of false .PERIOD it's a fake version .PERIOD 
however ,COMMA what we do have now is a much more variegated media ecosystem in which to kind of create this kind of value ,COMMA and it's much fairer .PERIOD 
yet we've never created the opportunity for impulse saving .PERIOD 
i would say it's a work of genius .PERIOD 
so i just want to get your first impressions when you see that ,COMMA when you see the diamond shreddies box there .PERIOD 
but it's kind of like flipping a six or a nine .PERIOD like a six ,COMMA if you flip it over it looks like a nine .PERIOD 
thank you very much indeed .PERIOD 
we're seeing the consequences all around us .PERIOD 
i would say not just biological design ,COMMA but all of the design that we think of as human design .PERIOD 
and <NUM> pages later .PERIOD 
and another <NUM> pages later .PERIOD 
or design out of chaos ,COMMA without the aid of mind .PERIOD 
chaos ?QUESTIONMARK no .PERIOD what ?QUESTIONMARK mind ?QUESTIONMARK no .PERIOD 
but that it will get copied if it can ,COMMA regardless of the consequences .PERIOD 
this is design process going on .PERIOD 
a meme is not equivalent to an idea .PERIOD 
audience :COLON sink ,COMMA toilet !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
this has spread all over the world .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this is a view of what humans are .PERIOD 
and indeed ,COMMA in the short time i've already been at ted ,COMMA i see we're even closer than i thought we were before .PERIOD 
we'll think we're choosing these things ,COMMA but the temes are making us do it .PERIOD 
it's been very productive ,COMMA that equation .PERIOD 
getting a new replicator is dangerous .PERIOD 
we may take the gaian view .PERIOD 
you know all about big brains .PERIOD 
and why would they do that ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA those are the two possibilities .PERIOD 
i have no idea .PERIOD 
i was afraid of a tsunami ;SEMICOLON what i didn't realize was there was a greater terror in haiti ,COMMA and that was building collapse .PERIOD 
after all ,COMMA it was the buildings ,COMMA not the earthquake ,COMMA that killed <NUM> people ,COMMA that injured <NUM> ,COMMA that displaced <NUM> million people ,COMMA that cut off food and water and supplies for an entire nation .PERIOD 
behind that door is the national judicial archives .PERIOD 
now there's a solution to all these problems .PERIOD 
and because i had <NUM> percent of my body burned ,COMMA it would take about an hour .PERIOD 
so originally i didn't have much money ,COMMA so i went to a hardware store and i bought a carpenter's vice .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA ten commandments is something that is hard to bring into the education system ,COMMA so we said ,COMMA why don't we get people to sign the honor code ?QUESTIONMARK 
and this is particularly interesting ,COMMA because mit doesn't have an honor code .PERIOD 
no bill ever disappeared .PERIOD 
we did not pay them with dollars ;SEMICOLON we paid them with something else .PERIOD 
but this did not solve the big problem i had with enron yet ,COMMA because in enron ,COMMA there's also a social element .PERIOD 
so everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment ,COMMA and we told them that at the end ,COMMA we asked them to pay us back the money they didn't make .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
what would happen to the other people in the group ?QUESTIONMARK 
will they cheat more ,COMMA or will they cheat less ?QUESTIONMARK 
all of the subjects sitting in the experiment were carnegie mellon students .PERIOD 
when we remind people about their morality ,COMMA they cheat less .PERIOD 
but unless we start testing those intuitions ,COMMA we're not going to do better .PERIOD 
okay .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA cèilidh first of all is gaelic for party ,COMMA but kitchen party in cape breton is very common ,COMMA and basically somebody drops into the house ,COMMA and no matter what house you go to in cape breton ,COMMA there's a fiddle there ,COMMA guaranteed ,COMMA and i'd say ,COMMA well there's first of all more fiddlers per capita in cape breton than anywhere in the world ,COMMA so ten chances to one ,COMMA the fellow who walked in the door could play it ,COMMA so you'd have someone come into the house ,COMMA you'd invite them to play a tune ,COMMA and lo and behold a little party would start up and somebody would dance ,COMMA and somebody would sing ,COMMA and all that sort of thing ,COMMA so it was a wonderful ,COMMA wonderful way to grow up ,COMMA and that is where my beginnings in music come from :COLON my surroundings ,COMMA my family ,COMMA just my bloodline in itself ,COMMA and ,COMMA oh ,COMMA i've done lots of things with my music .PERIOD 
donnell leahy :COLON thank you .PERIOD i'm kind of new to the ted experience and i'm glad to be here ,COMMA but i'm just trying to put it all together ,COMMA trying to figure all you people out ,COMMA and i've been here for a short while ,COMMA and i'm starting to understand a little bit better .PERIOD 
we learned to play the instruments ,COMMA but we kind of had to come from within or go from within ,COMMA because we didn't watch television ,COMMA we didn't listen to a lot of radio .PERIOD we went to church and to school sometimes ,COMMA and farmed and played music ,COMMA so we were able ,COMMA i think ,COMMA at a very critical age to develop our own style ,COMMA our own self ,COMMA and my mother plays ,COMMA my father plays ,COMMA and the style that came from the ottawa valley in ontario ,COMMA we call it french-canadian style but it originated in logging camps .PERIOD 
airs were played in europe at burials ,COMMA as a body was carried out from the wake site to the burial site ,COMMA the procession was led by a piper or a fiddle player .PERIOD 
we're laughing ,COMMA like ,COMMA because our styles are totally different ,COMMA as you can hear .PERIOD

i photographed her before and after the birth of her beautiful baby girl ,COMMA issa .PERIOD 
joyce's mother is now taking care of her daughter ,COMMA like so many other zimbabwean children who've been orphaned by the epidemic .PERIOD 
and i was constantly reading the new york times ,COMMA and stunned by the statistics ,COMMA the numbers .PERIOD 
so i quit my job and decided that that's the subject that i wanted to tackle .PERIOD 
we've known about fusion since <NUM> ,COMMA when sir arthur stanley eddington and the british association for the advancement of science conjectured that that's why the sun shines .PERIOD 
and once it was sort of explained to me how fast we were using up the world's resources ,COMMA i got very upset ,COMMA about as upset as i did when i realized that the earth will only last about five billion years before it's swallowed by the sun .PERIOD 
energy ,COMMA at the moment ,COMMA is dominated by resource .PERIOD 
it's a medium-sized nucleus .PERIOD 
and indeed that's exactly what stars do .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA that's that process there .PERIOD deuterium and tritium goes together makes helium <NUM> .PERIOD 
and that energy is what powers fusion .PERIOD 
and as you go across there you see a few tens of years of oil - the blue line ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA is the lowest estimate of existing resources .PERIOD

so ,COMMA how would we make it ?QUESTIONMARK 
we can do fusion .PERIOD in the center of this device we made <NUM> megawatts of fusion power in <NUM> .PERIOD 
if you want to know how ,COMMA ask yourself this question :COLON what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail ?QUESTIONMARK 
because when you ask it ,COMMA you begin to understand how the fear of failure constrains you ,COMMA how it keeps us from attempting great things ,COMMA and life gets dull ,COMMA amazing things stop happening .PERIOD 
the path to truly new ,COMMA never-been-done-before things always has failure along the way .PERIOD 
in october of <NUM> ,COMMA the prevailing opinion of expert aerodynamicists was that maybe in <NUM> million years we could build an aircraft that would fly .PERIOD 
<NUM> years later ,COMMA aero experts coined the term transonic .PERIOD 
since we took to the sky ,COMMA we have wanted to fly faster and farther .PERIOD 
it's boosted to near-space atop a minotaur iv rocket .PERIOD 
that's an unnatural act for a rocket .PERIOD 
the third stage has a camera .PERIOD 
this is the actual rocketcam footage from flight one .PERIOD

this is a hummingbird drone .PERIOD

this green goo is perhaps the vaccine that could save your life .PERIOD 
they are nerds ,COMMA and they are heroes among us .PERIOD 
there is only time enough to iron your cape and back to the skies for you .PERIOD 
well i don't think we ultimately know what it will be ,COMMA right .PERIOD 
it's actually ,COMMA look at that cute hummingbird flying into my headquarters .PERIOD 
well look ,COMMA our singular mission is the creation and prevention of strategic surprise .PERIOD 
that's what we do .PERIOD 
and you persuade people to go to these great feats of invention ,COMMA but at a personal level ,COMMA in a way i can't imagine doing your job .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA quite frankly ,COMMA on this issue ,COMMA there is no other road .PERIOD 
sorry ,COMMA this was my mother ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA in her bead shop in london .PERIOD 
because just that soil could make the acoustic difference .PERIOD 
and the british government saying ,COMMA you need to be in the top five .PERIOD 
but you just have to go to a garden center ,COMMA and they're in little paper packets .PERIOD 
and so there was one particular toy that gave us a clue .PERIOD 
and the government agreed to do that and not do anything else ,COMMA and focus our energy on that .PERIOD 
this is the only project that we've done where the finished thing looked more like a rendering than our renderings .PERIOD 
i'm sorry about my stupid voice there .PERIOD 
so if we could chop that away and give the building a small bottom ,COMMA we could take that bit and put it at the top where the greater commercial value is for a property developer .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
june cohen :COLON so thank you .PERIOD thank you ,COMMA thomas .PERIOD you're a delight .PERIOD 
well that fundamental sense of oneness is lost on us very quickly .PERIOD 
the self changed ,COMMA got affected ,COMMA broken ,COMMA destroyed ,COMMA but another one would evolve - sometimes stronger ,COMMA sometimes hateful ,COMMA sometimes not wanting to be there at all .PERIOD 
the self was not constant .PERIOD 
but nature had its wicked way ,COMMA and brown babies were born .PERIOD 
it was the first time that i existed inside a fully-functioning self - one that i controlled ,COMMA that i steered ,COMMA that i gave life to .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA i thought i had the answer to that one ,COMMA and i said ,COMMA skin color .PERIOD 
for a start ,COMMA we can think about all the times when we do lose ourselves .PERIOD 
i take it to therapy .PERIOD 
and in that disconnected state ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA we can build factory farms with no windows ,COMMA destroy marine life and use rape as a weapon of war .PERIOD 
thank you for listening .PERIOD 
you can see my fellow riders at the end of the picture ,COMMA looking at me with some concern .PERIOD 
and here is another picture of them .PERIOD 
they are supposed to be locked up .PERIOD 
and i became increasingly more and more agitated ,COMMA because i was there not only to be with them ,COMMA but also to ride and create a team and i didn't know what to do .PERIOD 
we're going downhill in some rocky terrain ,COMMA and the front tire of alex gets caught in one of these crevasses here .PERIOD 
i've had it .PERIOD 
it took me several such incidents to figure out what i was supposed to do .PERIOD 
at the beginning ,COMMA it was a disaster .PERIOD 
i tried harsh words and threats and they took me nowhere .PERIOD 
go away you maniac-psychopath .PERIOD 
and i would say ,COMMA relax ,COMMA alex .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA for such a kid ,COMMA when an adult that he learns to respect stays close to him and doesn't walk away from him in any situation ,COMMA irrespective of how he behaves ,COMMA it's a tremendous healing experience .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i come from a cutthroat world of science and high technology .PERIOD 
i used to think that reason and logic and relentless drive were the only ways to make things happen .PERIOD 
all you have to do is play with it ,COMMA change it a little bit ,COMMA and come up with something that does help ,COMMA that does work .PERIOD 
or you can also look back in time and realize that you've already conquered steeper mountains before .PERIOD 
and so we talked about these special words that we teach them .PERIOD 
in every one of these rides i always end up standing in one of these incredible locations ,COMMA taking in this incredible landscape around me ,COMMA and i feel blessed and fortunate that i'm alive ,COMMA and that i sense every fiber in my aching body .PERIOD 
the blank slate was an influential idea in the <NUM> century .PERIOD 
this is a recent study by the neurobiologist paul thompson and his colleagues in which they - using mri - measured the distribution of gray matter - that is ,COMMA the outer layer of the cortex - in a large sample of pairs of people .PERIOD 
and as you can see ,COMMA large amounts of the brain are not purple ,COMMA showing that if one person has a thicker bit of cortex in that region ,COMMA so does his fraternal twin .PERIOD 
and here's what happens if you get a pair of people who share all their dna - namely ,COMMA clones or identical twins .PERIOD 
another political fear of human nature is that if we are blank slates ,COMMA we can perfect mankind - the age-old dream of the perfectibility of our species through social engineering .PERIOD 
and so when thomas jefferson wrote in the declaration of independence ,COMMA we hold these truths to be self-evident ,COMMA that all men are created equal ,COMMA he did not mean we hold these truths to be self-evident ,COMMA that all men are clones .PERIOD 
that is because the human mind is a complex system with many parts ,COMMA and some of them can inhibit others .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA there's excellent reason to believe that virtually all humans are born with a moral sense ,COMMA and that we have cognitive abilities that allow us to profit from the lessons of history .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA the night is young ,COMMA but the book has been out for half a year ,COMMA and nothing terrible has happened .PERIOD 
visual arts - decoration of surfaces and bodies - appears to be a human universal .PERIOD 
a paraphrase of a quote by virginia woolf ,COMMA and there's some debate as to what she actually meant by that .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA this is perhaps a representative example of the visual depiction of the female form in the <NUM> century ;SEMICOLON here is a representative example of the depiction of the female form in the <NUM> century .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA this turned out to be probably the most controversial claim in the book .PERIOD 
and the job in question was sheep rancher .PERIOD 
this one was actually around the playing cards i got yesterday ,COMMA but it had a certain familiarity to it .PERIOD 
albert is the shepherd in question .PERIOD 
albert goes in ,COMMA i follow albert ,COMMA the crew is around .PERIOD 
i say ,COMMA time out .PERIOD stop .PERIOD 
we don't fool around ,COMMA we don't rehearse - we shoot what we get !EXCLAMATIONMARK

he says ,COMMA ok .PERIOD

melanie picks up the lamb ,COMMA puts it on the post ,COMMA opens it up .PERIOD 
i do .PERIOD 
and i'm like ,COMMA what is this jacked-up metaphor ?QUESTIONMARK 
anagnorisis is the greek word for discovery .PERIOD 
that's peripety or peripeteia .PERIOD 
it's crushing when the audience sees it the right way .PERIOD 
looking at that poor other little thing that i'd done it the right way on ,COMMA and i just was struck by if i'm wrong about that and if i'm wrong so often ,COMMA in a literal way ,COMMA what other peripatetic misconceptions might i be able to comment upon ?QUESTIONMARK 
i mean ,COMMA these are the people that i work with every single day .PERIOD 
because ,COMMA dude ,COMMA you know ,COMMA four years .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA follow your dreams and go broke ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
right ?QUESTIONMARK 
they know that other things come first - the business of doing the work comes first ,COMMA the business of getting it done .PERIOD 
most hazardous environment i'd ever seen ,COMMA and i was back with a guy ,COMMA lashing the pots down .PERIOD 
i scamper down ,COMMA i go into the wheelhouse and i say ,COMMA with some level of incredulity ,COMMA captain ,COMMA osha .PERIOD 
it goes like this - we've declared war on work ,COMMA as a society ,COMMA all of us .PERIOD 
we turn them into heroes ,COMMA or we turn them into punch lines .PERIOD 
i just know that that's a front in this war .PERIOD 
and i realized ,COMMA probably too late in this game - i hope not ,COMMA because i don't know if i can do <NUM> more of these things - but we're going to do as many as we can .PERIOD 
it's been great talking to you and get back to work ,COMMA will you ?QUESTIONMARK 
democracy ,COMMA as a type of politics ,COMMA is a technology for the control and deployment of power .PERIOD 
islam represents a way of engaging the world through which one can achieve certain desirable goals .PERIOD 
you can show the capitol - i had the same problem when i was designing the cover of my forthcoming book ,COMMA in fact - what do you put on the cover to show democracy ?QUESTIONMARK 
you can show a mosque ,COMMA or you can show worshippers ,COMMA but there's not a straightforward way of depicting islam .PERIOD 
these are contested points ,COMMA and it's impossible to answer them by saying ,COMMA ah ha ,COMMA i looked in the right place ,COMMA and i found out what these concepts mean .PERIOD 
and i think that that's ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA probably the first appropriate response .PERIOD 
and the hopeful response derives from recognizing that islam and democracy are technologies .PERIOD 
and they're making this argument wherever they're permitted to make it .PERIOD 
they were actually blocked from even forming a party under the political system there .PERIOD why ?QUESTIONMARK 
now what i want to suggest to you is that the reason for hope in this case is that we are on the edge of a real transformation in the muslim world .PERIOD 
when these heartbreaking images of oiled birds finally began to emerge from the gulf of mexico last year during the horrific bp oil spill ,COMMA a german biologist by the name of silvia gaus was quoted as saying ,COMMA we should just euthanize all oiled birds because studies have shown that fewer than one percent of them survive after being released .PERIOD 
and the local seabird rescue center ,COMMA named sanccob ,COMMA immediately launched a massive rescue operation - and this soon would become the largest animal rescue ever undertaken .PERIOD 
i was a penguin aquarist at the new england aquarium .PERIOD 
i was instantly transported back to that moment in time .PERIOD 
so for the few of us that were there in a professional capacity ,COMMA this extraordinary volunteer response to this animal crisis was profoundly moving and awe-inspiring .PERIOD 
now mind you ,COMMA three days earlier ,COMMA we had <NUM> penguins under our care ,COMMA so we were definitely overwhelmed and just a bit terrified - at least i was .PERIOD 
and you may notice they're wearing very thick gloves .PERIOD 
he said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA why don't we try and collect the birds at the greatest risk of getting oiled - they collected <NUM> - and we'll ship them <NUM> miles up the coast to port elizabeth in these open air trucks and release them into the clean waters there and let them swim back home .PERIOD 
about a year prior to this oil spill ,COMMA a <NUM> year-old student had invented a degreaser .PERIOD 
just look at that <NUM> year-old .PERIOD 
and the two main threats to penguins today are overfishing and global warming .PERIOD 
and i was doing some rather controversial religious programs .PERIOD 
this went down very well in the u.k. where religion is extremely unpopular .PERIOD 
indeed ,COMMA some of the world traditions think very little of religious orthodoxy .PERIOD 
you behave in a committed way ,COMMA and then you begin to understand the truths of religion .PERIOD 
why ?QUESTIONMARK because in compassion ,COMMA when we feel with the other ,COMMA we dethrone ourselves from the center of our world and we put another person there .PERIOD and once we get rid of ego ,COMMA then we're ready to see the divine .PERIOD 
and in particular ,COMMA every single one of the major world traditions has highlighted - has said - and put at the core of their tradition what's become known as the golden rule .PERIOD 
hillel stood on one leg and said ,COMMA that which is hateful to you ,COMMA do not do to your neighbor .PERIOD that is the torah .PERIOD the rest is commentary .PERIOD 
so the traditions also insisted - and this is an important point ,COMMA i think - that you could not and must not confine your compassion to your own group :COLON your own nation ,COMMA your own co-religionists ,COMMA your own fellow countrymen .PERIOD you must have what one of the chinese sages called jian ai :COLON concern for everybody .PERIOD love your enemies .PERIOD honor the stranger .PERIOD 
and this ,COMMA again - this universal outreach - is getting subdued in the strident use of religion - abuse of religion - for nefarious gains .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i've lost count of the number of taxi drivers who ,COMMA when i say to them what i do for a living ,COMMA inform me that religion has been the cause of all the major world wars in history .PERIOD wrong .PERIOD 
because it seems to me that with - our current situation is so serious at the moment that any ideology that doesn't promote a sense of global understanding and global appreciation of each other is failing the test of the time .PERIOD 
i was part of that united nations initiative called the alliance of civilizations ,COMMA which was asked by kofi annan to diagnose the causes of extremism ,COMMA and to give practical guidelines to member states about how to avoid the escalation of further extremism .PERIOD 
it was just one of those pot-luck things where you get it right first time .PERIOD 
moving on to something a bit larger ,COMMA this is an x-ray of a bus .PERIOD 
it's not just topshop ,COMMA i get some strange looks when i go out getting my props .PERIOD 
and to carry on with a theme that we've already touched with is how nature is related to architecture .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA that is three months solid x-raying .PERIOD 
and when they do ,COMMA i'm in the queue .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i like to use them .PERIOD 
that flower doesn't come in bright orange ,COMMA i don't think .PERIOD 
i'm now going to show you a short film ,COMMA i'll step to the side .PERIOD 
the bus was done with a cargo-scanning x-ray machine ,COMMA which is used on the borders between countries ,COMMA looking for contraband and illegal immigrants .PERIOD 
i will show how the capillary action works ,COMMA how it feeds ,COMMA i'll be able to get all the cells inside that stem .PERIOD 
sometimes you keep the time up ,COMMA because the time gives you detail .PERIOD 
the longer the exposure goes on for ,COMMA the more detail you get .PERIOD 
i've got the opportunity now to show you what i'm going to be doing in the future .PERIOD 
like ,COMMA my first computer was a big movement in my life .PERIOD 
meet tony .PERIOD he's my student .PERIOD 
if i ever get out of here ,COMMA there will always be a mark by my name .PERIOD 
i'm a convict ;SEMICOLON i am branded'wrong .PERIOD' what are you going to tell me about right and wrong ?QUESTIONMARK 
then can you tell me what wrong is ?QUESTIONMARK 
socrates died in prison ,COMMA his philosophy intact .PERIOD 
his body is in prison ,COMMA but his mind is free .PERIOD 
yes ,COMMA they gave <NUM> monkeys a typewriter for a week ,COMMA and after a week ,COMMA they only used it as a bathroom .PERIOD 
you'll been engulfed by a red giant .PERIOD 
love does not die because of that thing .PERIOD 
i'm very lucky ,COMMA because he's better than all the other children .PERIOD 
that's the wonderful thing about evolution - the predilection to believe that our child is best .PERIOD 
now in many ways ,COMMA that's just a survival thing .PERIOD 
the fact we see here is the vehicle for our genes ,COMMA and therefore we love it .PERIOD 
but we don't notice that bit ;SEMICOLON we just unconditionally love .PERIOD 
perhaps you've been at home for a week on your own .PERIOD 
you house is in a terrible state .PERIOD 
you think ,COMMA what should i do ?QUESTIONMARK 
for me ,COMMA it's a very ,COMMA very important thing .PERIOD 
i look out the window ,COMMA and i realize that every single time we stop and i look out that window ,COMMA framed in that window ,COMMA wherever we are ,COMMA i am observing more life than there is in the rest of the known universe beyond the planet earth .PERIOD 
that ,COMMA to me ,COMMA is an incredible thing .PERIOD 
i began the vagina monologues because i was worried about vaginas .PERIOD 
what does anyone mean when they talk about real security ?QUESTIONMARK 
this is ,COMMA of course ,COMMA unless your whole life is about being secure .PERIOD 
you become whatever it is that will freeze you ,COMMA numb you and protect you from doubt or change .PERIOD 
but all this does ,COMMA actually ,COMMA is shut down your mind .PERIOD 
one of the amazing things that i've discovered in my travels is that there is this emerging species .PERIOD 
i've discovered these people ,COMMA who ,COMMA in v-day world ,COMMA we call vagina warriors .PERIOD 
they raised <NUM> dollars on a production that never occurred .PERIOD 
now this seems like a fairly ,COMMA you know ,COMMA frivolous ,COMMA but what happened as a result of that ,COMMA is that that school now is forming a sex education class .PERIOD it's beginning to talk about sex ,COMMA it's beginning to look at why it would be wrong for a young high school girl to talk about her vagina publicly or to say that she loved her vagina publicly .PERIOD 
in the years that she walked ,COMMA she educated parents ,COMMA mothers ,COMMA fathers .PERIOD 
real security is contemplating death ,COMMA not pretending it doesn't exist .PERIOD 
and i think part of what i'm learning in this process is that one must allow oneself to feel grief .PERIOD 
now i was stupid ,COMMA but not so stupid that i turned it down .PERIOD 
it is the story factory ,COMMA one of the very best in the world .PERIOD 
but they all have one thing in common :COLON they all need to look like something .PERIOD 
they all need a face .PERIOD 
the first was katharine hepburn's memoirs ,COMMA and the second was a biography of marlene dietrich .PERIOD 
so the hepburn story is words and the dietrich story is pictures ,COMMA and so we did this .PERIOD 
and what i ended up with was a graphic representation of us seeing this animal coming into being .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA that is not me .PERIOD 
that's a responsibility .PERIOD 
a book cover is a distillation .PERIOD 
this story was a real puzzle .PERIOD 
huhh !EXCLAMATIONMARK and now the sultan is in danger .PERIOD 
don't get me started .PERIOD 
but something is definitely lost :COLON tradition ,COMMA a sensual experience ,COMMA the comfort of thingy-ness - a little bit of humanity .PERIOD 
what does it look like ?QUESTIONMARK 
yes .PERIOD it can ,COMMA it does and it will ,COMMA but for this book designer ,COMMA page-turner ,COMMA dog-eared place-holder ,COMMA notes in the margins-taker ,COMMA ink-sniffer ,COMMA the story looks like this .PERIOD 
the students should teach their teachers .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA we heard that one too ,COMMA but pioneer germ fighters totally rules .PERIOD 
instead of just scoffing at this heresy that a kid wanted to get published or saying wait until you're older ,COMMA my parents were really supportive .PERIOD 
the school i went to was pretty boring .PERIOD 
and that was the finishing post right there .PERIOD 
but our school at that time got a grant from the government ,COMMA and they got an incredible computer - the research machine 3dz - and they left the programming manuals lying around .PERIOD 
that's what they thought they had built it for .PERIOD 
this is one of my favorite ones here ,COMMA where they have rabbit breeding ,COMMA so males choose the lucky rabbit .PERIOD 
so i went on for the next <NUM> years or so making a lot of different games .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA chris did ask me to bring some statistics with me ,COMMA so i've done that .PERIOD 
but <NUM> percent of games don't have any mature content whatsoever ,COMMA so it's just not true .PERIOD 
it makes about <NUM> million bucks a month in subscriptions .PERIOD 
i wanted to update that video and give you a new look at it .PERIOD 
i played in the backyard ,COMMA learned to read ,COMMA and even ate some of my vegetables .PERIOD 
but as was the case for most of my generation ,COMMA i spent a lot of time in front of the tv .PERIOD 
their importance blends into the sensationalized drama of prime time tv .PERIOD 
i have fought in wars ,COMMA feared for my own survival ,COMMA watched my cohorts die on beaches and woods that look and feel more real than any textbook or any news story .PERIOD 
as gamers we are now living by the same laws of physics in the same cities and doing many of the same things we once did in real life ,COMMA only virtually .PERIOD 
the sensory cues are very similar .PERIOD 
more beautiful and rich than the real world around us .PERIOD 
video games are fun ,COMMA engaging ,COMMA and leave your brain completely vulnerable to re-programming .PERIOD 
there is a potential to do good as well .PERIOD 
wow .PERIOD 
this is just a cool shot ,COMMA because this is students coming to school after class .PERIOD 
she's never going to know a world where video games aren't incredibly emotional and will probably make her cry .PERIOD 
chris anderson :COLON david perry .PERIOD that was awesome .PERIOD 
it's this change in perspective on what it is we think we're perceiving that has helped us make more progress in the last <NUM> years than we have in the rest of human history .PERIOD 
so one of the things that goes from simple to complex is when we do more .PERIOD we like more .PERIOD 
and in fact ,COMMA what murray was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty of nature - of having the descriptions at various levels be rather similar - all goes down to the idea that the elementary particles are both sticky and standoffish ,COMMA and they're in violent motion .PERIOD 
not because it wasn't beautiful or anything ,COMMA but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand about molecular biology ,COMMA and that is :COLON why is there any probability at all of two complex shapes finding each other just the right way so they combine together and be catalyzed ?QUESTIONMARK 
so they had created these artifacts .PERIOD 
so that's what lauren did .PERIOD 
each time i click it ,COMMA car turn .PERIOD 
who's got the apple ?QUESTIONMARK 
we've done that already .PERIOD 
galileo ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA did this very cleverly by running a ball backwards down the strings of his lute .PERIOD 
i'm focusing on biology ,COMMA the biological sciences .PERIOD 
and thereby hangs a tale .PERIOD 
you just have to look at the human genome project .PERIOD 
we're reading the book of life .PERIOD 
on the way there it's going to completely revolutionize medicine and health care ;SEMICOLON that's obvious .PERIOD 
what we're doing is we are seizing control of our evolutionary future .PERIOD 
that is going to be the it challenge of the next generation ,COMMA is communicating all this information .PERIOD 
we're sort of circumventing evolutionary programs that guide our behavior .PERIOD 
it didn't happen .PERIOD 
and pretty soon it's going to be possible to avoid virtually all genetic diseases in that way .PERIOD 
directly going in - it's a little bit further away ,COMMA but not that far away - going in and altering the genes in the first cell in an embryo .PERIOD 
people can try and ban these things .PERIOD 
other people are going to say ,COMMA this is great .PERIOD 
and from the beginning of today's sessions you'd think that they're going to see this as this horrible difficult ,COMMA painful period that we struggled through .PERIOD 
and i don't think that's what's going to happen .PERIOD 
they are going to think about it as this glorious instant when we laid down the very foundations of their lives ,COMMA of their society ,COMMA of their future .PERIOD 
i have a daughter ,COMMA mulan .PERIOD 
it's our own pond .PERIOD and that's how it happens .PERIOD 
i know .PERIOD 
she's like ,COMMA what ?QUESTIONMARK and she goes ,COMMA but mom ,COMMA but men and women can't ever see each other naked ,COMMA mom .PERIOD 
human males and females develop a special bond ,COMMA and when they're much older ,COMMA much ,COMMA much older than you ,COMMA and they have a very special feeling ,COMMA then they can be naked together .PERIOD 
i don't understand the legs .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA the internet has empowered us .PERIOD 
and as he came the second day ,COMMA i thought ,COMMA wow ,COMMA that's really a cartoon lover .PERIOD 
you will not like it .PERIOD 
this looks like a giant hamburger .PERIOD 
i was there to report on that story in cartoons .PERIOD 
i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA maybe we don't have time for this right now .PERIOD 
show the positive power of cartoons .PERIOD 
and i've been doing projects like this ,COMMA in <NUM> in lebanon ,COMMA this year in kenya ,COMMA back in january .PERIOD 
so this was a great project .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i want to start out with this beautiful picture from my childhood .PERIOD 
if you go back two billion years ,COMMA you're not on an earth-like planet any more .PERIOD 
what we call an earth-like planet is actually a very short interval of time .PERIOD 
we are right now in the beautiful oreo of existence - of at least life on planet earth - following the first horrible microbial age .PERIOD 
we have as much time for animals to exist on this planet as they have been here now ,COMMA till we hit the second microbial age .PERIOD 
and that's the fate of a planet ,COMMA too .PERIOD 
all along it was thought to be either an act of god or perhaps long ,COMMA slow climate change ,COMMA and that really changed in <NUM> ,COMMA in this rocky outcrop near gubbio ,COMMA where walter alvarez ,COMMA trying to figure out what was the time difference between these white rocks ,COMMA which held creatures of the cretaceous period ,COMMA and the pink rocks above ,COMMA which held tertiary fossils .PERIOD 
a 10-kilometer body hit the planet .PERIOD 
this is a gorgonopsian ,COMMA or a gorgon .PERIOD 
but there's lots of stuff .PERIOD 
this is called paleontological child abuse .PERIOD 
and the what ,COMMA i think ,COMMA is that we returned ,COMMA over and over again ,COMMA to the pre-cambrian world ,COMMA that first microbial age ,COMMA and the microbes are still out there .PERIOD 
and the last three years have seen an enormous breakthrough in a brand-new field .PERIOD 
we had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period .PERIOD 
this is a tracking experiment ,COMMA and any of you scuba divers ,COMMA if you want to get involved in one of the coolest projects ever ,COMMA this is off the great barrier reef .PERIOD 
this is a great white shark that ate some of my traps .PERIOD 
we pulled it up ;SEMICOLON up it comes .PERIOD so ,COMMA it's out there with me at night .PERIOD

now ,COMMA the same mouse is given <NUM> parts per million hydrogen sulfide in this solid graph ,COMMA and look what happens to its temperature .PERIOD 
do we all have to have a little button saying ,COMMA let me die ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA what we're looking at now :COLON does it leave a signal ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's simultaneously an incredible medical technique ,COMMA but also a terrifying .PERIOD 
this cell phone started its trajectory in an artisanal mine in the eastern congo .PERIOD 
and all of those products probably end their lives in a dump like this one in manila .PERIOD 
some of these governance gaps are run by rogue states .PERIOD 
but right now ,COMMA most of the companies involved in these supply chains don't have any way of assuring us that nobody had to mortgage their future ,COMMA nobody had to sacrifice their rights to bring us our favorite brand name product .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i didn't come here to depress you about the state of the global supply chain .PERIOD 
it's a pharmaceutical product .PERIOD 
you expect that the supply chain that gets it to the hospital ,COMMA probably squeaky clean .PERIOD 
so a couple of years ago ,COMMA we had a scandal which killed about <NUM> people around the world ,COMMA because of contaminants that crept into the heparin supply chain .PERIOD 
and the usfda has a jurisdictional problem .PERIOD 
but they are extremely efficient organizations .PERIOD 
you can call yourself responsible ,COMMA but responsibility without accountability often doesn't work .PERIOD 
just look at pandemics - swine flu ,COMMA bird flu ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD 
there are thousands of suppliers in there .PERIOD 
it seems too daunting ,COMMA too dangerous ,COMMA for any company to take on .PERIOD 
please ask them to treat us like human beings .PERIOD 
so i appeal to you .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA there's a few heartbreaks that chocolate can't fix .PERIOD 
your voice is small ,COMMA but don't ever stop singing .PERIOD 
but there are plenty of things i have trouble understanding .PERIOD 
spoken word poetry is the art of performance poetry .PERIOD 
and step three began when i realized that i didn't have to write poems that were indignant ,COMMA if that's not what i was .PERIOD 
and actually ,COMMA phil kaye and i coincidentally also share the same last name .PERIOD 
and the first list that i assign is <NUM> things i know to be true .PERIOD 
at a certain point ,COMMA you would realize that someone has the exact same thing ,COMMA or one thing very similar ,COMMA to something on your list .PERIOD

somebody once told me it's like walking through life like this .PERIOD

the long-lasting damage of nuclear radiation caused an entire city and its population to turn into powder .PERIOD

that was a tradition i wanted to follow .PERIOD

an aluminum factory in czechoslovakia was filled with carcinogenic smoke and dust ,COMMA and four out of five workers came down with cancer .PERIOD

i tried to tell the story through the work of caregivers .PERIOD 
i thought it was important to emphasize that people were being helped ,COMMA whether by international ngos or by local grassroots organizations .PERIOD 
the international community still hasn't found a way to create the pressure necessary to stop this genocide .PERIOD 
i'd been photographing in the islamic world since <NUM> - not only in the middle east ,COMMA but also in africa ,COMMA asia and europe .PERIOD 
for the first time in years ,COMMA shi'ites were allowed to make the pilgrimage to karbala to observe ashura ,COMMA and i was amazed by the sheer number of people and how fervently they practiced their religion .PERIOD 
the spirit they displayed was absolutely remarkable .PERIOD 
photographers go to the extreme edges of human experience to show people what's going on .PERIOD 
and therefore i will limit myself to only talk about the links between religion and sexuality .PERIOD 
so i will talk of what i remember as the most wonderful .PERIOD 
it's when the young couple whisper ,COMMA tonight we are going to make a baby .PERIOD 
will the number of children increase each year up to <NUM> years ,COMMA or will it continue in the same fast rate and be four billion children up there ?QUESTIONMARK 
so bear with our simplicity now when i take you over to this shot .PERIOD 
and here the income per person in comparable dollars .PERIOD 
otherwise it was only christian countries .PERIOD

it's an amazing improvement ,COMMA from seven children per woman ,COMMA they've gone all the way down to between four and five .PERIOD 
well i do as i always do .PERIOD 
i went to the statistical authority of qatar ,COMMA to their webpage - it's a very good webpage .PERIOD i recommend it - and i looked up - oh yeah ,COMMA you can have lots of fun here - and provided free of charge ,COMMA i found qatar's social trends .PERIOD 
now look again at this .PERIOD 
so what will happen now is quite straightforward .PERIOD 
most of us have to trust that that happens correctly for our own vote ,COMMA and we all have to trust that that happens correctly for all the votes in the election .PERIOD 
so this is how you vote .PERIOD 
so you let a poll station worker scan your encrypted vote .PERIOD 
and these are elections by the people ,COMMA for the people .PERIOD 
i was in india this past year ,COMMA and i may have seen the last cases of polio in the world .PERIOD 
and he made an outrageous prediction that smallpox would be eradicated ,COMMA and that this was god's gift to humanity because of the hard work of dedicated scientists .PERIOD 
audience :COLON early detection ,COMMA early response .PERIOD 
and india was the place where smallpox made its last stand .PERIOD 
you could vaccinate everybody in india ,COMMA but one year later there'll be <NUM> million new babies ,COMMA which was then the population of canada .PERIOD 
we had a scorecard that we wrote on every house .PERIOD 
this may be the year we eradicate polio - that will make it the second disease in history .PERIOD 
i hope that you will take a look at it .PERIOD 
would you get in an airplane with <NUM> people you didn't know ,COMMA coughing and sneezing ,COMMA when you knew that some of them might carry a disease that could kill you ,COMMA for which you had no antivirals or vaccine ?QUESTIONMARK

within three weeks it will be everywhere in the world .PERIOD 
let's increase the websites that they crawl from <NUM> to <NUM> million .PERIOD 
then a number of years went by ,COMMA and there were a lot of rumors about bird flu .PERIOD 
they reported this to who .PERIOD who took a little while taking action because who will only receive a report from a government ,COMMA because it's the united nations .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA what's really important is that ,COMMA before there was gphin ,COMMA <NUM> percent of all the world's reports of bad things - whether you're talking about famine or you're talking about bird flu or you're talking about ebola - <NUM> percent of all those reports came from nations .PERIOD 
the moment these guys in ottawa ,COMMA on a budget of <NUM> dollars a year ,COMMA got cracking ,COMMA <NUM> percent of all the reports in the world came from gphin ,COMMA <NUM> percent of all the reports in the world came from all the other <NUM> nations .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA here's what's real interesting ,COMMA after they'd been working for a couple years ,COMMA what do you think happened to those nations ?QUESTIONMARK 
i was this weird little kid who wanted to have deep talks about the worlds that might exist beyond the ones that we perceive with our senses .PERIOD 
take a breath right now of this clear air in this room .PERIOD 
they've made me a proud i-don't-know-it-all .PERIOD 
and we used some guidelines to keep our conversation elevated ,COMMA and you can use them too ,COMMA because i know you're all going to take an other to lunch .PERIOD 
my lunch partner and i came away with some really important insights ,COMMA and i'm going to share just one with you .PERIOD 
and since we had established some trust ,COMMA we believed in each other's sincerity .PERIOD 
we agreed we'd speak up in our own communities when we witnessed the kind of otherizing talk that can wound and fester into paranoia and then be used by those on the fringes to incite .PERIOD 
instead ,COMMA we had taken first steps together ,COMMA past our knee-jerk reactions ,COMMA to the ubuntu place ,COMMA which is the only place where solutions to our most intractable-seeming problems will be found .PERIOD 
because ubuntu work is slow ,COMMA and it's difficult .PERIOD 
it's two people ,COMMA two warriors ,COMMA dropping their weapons and reaching toward each other .PERIOD 
in my life ,COMMA when i tried to achieve things like success or recognition ,COMMA they eluded me .PERIOD 
and it is ,COMMA for me ,COMMA a language which expressed the intangible ,COMMA and gives voice to people and stories without .PERIOD 
joshua claims to have personally killed more than <NUM> people during liberia's civil war .PERIOD 
but what i saw opened my eyes to an idea of forgiveness which i never thought possible .PERIOD 
i was intensely moved during all this .PERIOD 
and yes ,COMMA all of those people killed were male .PERIOD 
many of the women are married with children ,COMMA and they say the hardest part of their deployment was being kept away from their children .PERIOD 
and when i asked one of the women about the shock and awe response ,COMMA she said ,COMMA don't worry ,COMMA same thing back home .PERIOD 
we know how to deal with these fellows ,COMMA and ignored them .PERIOD 
sometimes ,COMMA when the war is over and all the film crews have left ,COMMA the most inspiring stories are the ones that float just beneath the radar .PERIOD 
they answer more than <NUM> calls in just two months .PERIOD 
it seems that this story helped change perceptions about the dfs ,COMMA at least in the minds of an audience in part on televisions ,COMMA read magazines and whose huts aren't on fire .PERIOD 
that's right ,COMMA yeah .PERIOD very rarely do we ever know ,COMMA and if we find out at some stage then we destroy that information as soon as possible .PERIOD 
wow ,COMMA so your leak really substantially changed the world ?QUESTIONMARK 
let me know when you've got them .PERIOD let's shoot .PERIOD 
hotel .PERIOD bushmaster two-six ,COMMA bushmaster two-six ,COMMA we need to move ,COMMA time now !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
two-six ,COMMA this is two-six ,COMMA we're mobile .PERIOD 
what was the key element of this that actually caused the outrage ,COMMA do you think ?QUESTIONMARK 
i mean ,COMMA in general ,COMMA what's your philosophy ?QUESTIONMARK 
we have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal - personally identifying information in it .PERIOD 
yeah ,COMMA we do get a lot of that .PERIOD 
but do you see any irony in the fact that ,COMMA in order for you to shine that light ,COMMA you have to ,COMMA yourself ,COMMA create secrecy around your sources ?QUESTIONMARK 
you know ,COMMA there might be a couple of views of wikileaks and of julian .PERIOD 
so late last year - in november last year - there was a series of well blowouts in albania ,COMMA like the well blowout in the gulf of mexico ,COMMA but not quite as big .PERIOD 
so under that basis ,COMMA we put it out and said ,COMMA look ,COMMA we're skeptical about this thing .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA we're an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with ,COMMA so we have to restructure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff ,COMMA and then lower security cases .PERIOD 
can that be right ?QUESTIONMARK 
and you were also - i mean ,COMMA you were also a hacker at an early age and ran into the authorities early on .PERIOD 
so this phrase is not ,COMMA not as nice as it used to be .PERIOD 
so just tell us ,COMMA very quickly in the last minute ,COMMA the story :COLON what happened in iceland ?QUESTIONMARK 
instead ,COMMA they publicized your side .PERIOD 
however ,COMMA no studies exist yet that show how or why .PERIOD 
but then one night ,COMMA my mom was cooking grilled chicken for dinner ,COMMA and i noticed that the edges of the chicken ,COMMA which had been marinated in lemon juice ,COMMA turned white .PERIOD 
and later in biology class ,COMMA i learned that it's due to a process called denaturing ,COMMA which is where the proteins will change shape and lose their ability to chemically function .PERIOD 
i was the <NUM> year-old age category winner and then the grand prize winner .PERIOD 
and that was my first science fair project .PERIOD 
my parents suffered through many more of my science fair projects ,COMMA including a remote controlled garbage can .PERIOD 
and that's huge .PERIOD 
so that was my work ,COMMA and it was my way of reimagining the future for future research ,COMMA with figuring out exactly what this protein does ,COMMA but also for the future of chemotherapy effectiveness - so maybe all grandfathers with cancer have a little bit more time to spend with their grandchildren .PERIOD 
but soon after ,COMMA i developed a novel mathematical model that essentially quantifies the effect of these environmental pollutants on the lung health of asthmatic patients .PERIOD 
and it surprises me that no model currently exists that quantifies the effect of environmental factors on human lung health ,COMMA because that relationship seems so important .PERIOD 
because i realized that if we could find a way to target remediation ,COMMA we could also find a way to treat asthmatic patients more effectively .PERIOD 
these chemical pollutants are currently not a criteria air pollutant ,COMMA as defined by the u.s. clean air act .PERIOD 
so any user can come in here and click on lung function report and it'll take them to this report that i created .PERIOD 
my translation medium is a very simple basket .PERIOD 
that means that it is the numbers that control the form ,COMMA not me .PERIOD 
i use these scores to collaborate with musicians .PERIOD 
this piece here is read very differently depending on where you place it .PERIOD 
you place it in a science museum ,COMMA it becomes a three-dimensional visualization of data .PERIOD 
so after being interrogated by this japanese manager for a half an hour ,COMMA he finally said ,COMMA so ,COMMA miss yang ,COMMA do you have any questions to ask me ?QUESTIONMARK 
and sometimes i have young people approaching me say ,COMMA lan ,COMMA you changed my life ,COMMA and i feel proud of that .PERIOD 
so it means young couples will have to support four parents who have a life expectancy of <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
so making a living is not that easy for young people .PERIOD 
and for those who are ready to get married and buy their apartment ,COMMA they figured out they have to work for <NUM> to <NUM> years to afford their first apartment .PERIOD 
for those who do return back to the countryside ,COMMA they find themselves very welcome locally ,COMMA because with the knowledge ,COMMA skills and networks they have learned in the cities ,COMMA with the assistance of the internet ,COMMA they're able to create more jobs ,COMMA upgrade local agriculture and create new business in the less developed market .PERIOD 
and after hours of negotiation ,COMMA <NUM> dogs were rescued .PERIOD 
and here also people are helping to find missing children .PERIOD 
i guess these are the questions people are going to answer .PERIOD 
and our younger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves .PERIOD 
they only learn to be frightened of those differences when an adult influences them to behave that way ,COMMA and maybe censors that natural curiosity ,COMMA or you know ,COMMA reins in the question-asking in the hopes of them being polite little kids .PERIOD 
the doors open ,COMMA the kids descend on this table of legs ,COMMA and they are poking and prodding ,COMMA and they're wiggling toes ,COMMA and they're trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg to see what happens with that .PERIOD 
and immediately a voice shouted ,COMMA kangaroo !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
and then ,COMMA one eight-year-old said ,COMMA hey ,COMMA why wouldn't you want to fly too ?QUESTIONMARK 
so this magazine ,COMMA through the hands of graphic designer peter saville ,COMMA went to fashion designer alexander mcqueen ,COMMA and photographer nick knight ,COMMA who were also interested in exploring that conversation .PERIOD 
today ,COMMA i have over a dozen pair of prosthetic legs that various people have made for me ,COMMA and with them i have different negotiations of the terrain under my feet ,COMMA and i can change my height - i have a variable of five different heights .PERIOD 
today ,COMMA i'm <NUM>' <NUM> .PERIOD 
it's a conversation about augmentation .PERIOD 
as lord blackstone described it ,COMMA land is protected by trespass law ,COMMA for most of the history of trespass law ,COMMA by presuming it protects the land all the way down below and to an indefinite extent upward .PERIOD 
and bmi was much more democratic in the art that it would include within its repertoire ,COMMA including african american music for the first time in the repertoire .PERIOD 
in my view ,COMMA the most significant thing to recognize about what this internet is doing is its opportunity to revive the read-write culture that sousa romanticized .PERIOD 
white europeans were subject to the plague .PERIOD 
we can date it to <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
and if you're thinking of efficient information storage mechanisms ,COMMA it may not turn out to be chips .PERIOD 
we're just beginning this journey of life in the new zoo .PERIOD 
and you can do strange things with this stuff .PERIOD this is a baby gar .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the last of these things died in september <NUM> .PERIOD 
and if we do that ,COMMA and insert this into a fertilized wolf's egg ,COMMA we may give birth to an animal that hasn't walked the earth since <NUM> .PERIOD 
the really neat thing about this stuff is that's life .PERIOD 
and in the measure that we learn how chickens grow wings ,COMMA and what the program is for those cells to differentiate ,COMMA one of the things we're going to be able to do is to stop undifferentiated cells ,COMMA which you know as cancer ,COMMA and one of the things we're going to learn how to do is how to reprogram cells like stem cells in such a way that they express bone ,COMMA stomach ,COMMA skin ,COMMA pancreas .PERIOD 
that's why sometimes a person's genes don't have to change a lot to get cancer .PERIOD 
same thing with receptin if you've got breast cancer .PERIOD 
and you can watch states rise and fall depending on their ability to speak a language of life ,COMMA and you can watch new york fall off a cliff ,COMMA and you can watch new jersey fall off a cliff ,COMMA and you can watch the rise of the new empires of intelligence .PERIOD 
that's why nations rise and fall .PERIOD 
in the <NUM> ,COMMA these are sovereign states that did not exist before <NUM> .PERIOD 
and when noah had done built his ark ,COMMA i understand that somebody began to rend a song .PERIOD 
and the old lady said ,COMMA oh yes ,COMMA come on in .PERIOD 
it was great .PERIOD 
it's really amazing .PERIOD 
if you want to know about africa ,COMMA read our literature - and not just things fall apart ,COMMA because that would be like saying ,COMMA i've read'gone with the wind' and so i know everything about america .PERIOD 
we've had a lot of - a parade of amazing ideas here .PERIOD 
but harry's wife is confused ,COMMA because she said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA harry had been packing his own lunch for <NUM> years .PERIOD 
so i had a very inventive teacher ,COMMA a pakistani muslim ,COMMA who wanted to teach us about this .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA picture this - really picture this .PERIOD 
we are squandering the most valuable resource we have on this continent :COLON the valuable resource of the imagination .PERIOD 
and we want to say to idris ,COMMA chop him up .PERIOD 
shut him up .PERIOD 
the question is ,COMMA how do i balance narratives that are wonderful with narratives of wounds and self-loathing ?QUESTIONMARK 
as a young middle-class nigerian activist ,COMMA i launched myself along with a whole generation of us into the campaign to stop the government .PERIOD 
i justified it ,COMMA and i said ,COMMA this is the cost of revolution .PERIOD 
have i not myself been imprisoned ?QUESTIONMARK 
and so they said ,COMMA tell me about africa ,COMMA professor abani .PERIOD 
there are no essential africans ,COMMA and most of us are as completely ignorant as everyone else about the continent we come from ,COMMA and yet we want to make profound statements about it .PERIOD 
gazelle ,COMMA i killed you for your skin's exquisite touch ,COMMA for how easy it is to be nailed to a board weathered raw as white butcher paper .PERIOD 
rise and walk away like a panther .PERIOD 
also the person sitting in your very seats is a liar .PERIOD 
i watch that tv show'lie to me .PERIOD' i know you're lying .PERIOD 
they use it to get to the truth ,COMMA and they do what mature leaders do everyday ;SEMICOLON they have difficult conversations with difficult people ,COMMA sometimes during very difficult times .PERIOD 
its power emerges when someone else agrees to believe the lie .PERIOD 
deception is actually serious business .PERIOD 
it's woven into the fabric of our daily and our business lives .PERIOD 
koko was taught to communicate via sign language .PERIOD 
and i need to go back to work for the american people .PERIOD 
now if bill clinton had said ,COMMA well ,COMMA to tell you the truth .PERIOD or richard nixon's favorite ,COMMA in all candor .PERIOD he would have been a dead giveaway for any liespotter than knows that qualifying language ,COMMA as it's called ,COMMA qualifying language like that ,COMMA further discredits the subject .PERIOD 
freud had it right .PERIOD 
with body language ,COMMA here's what you've got to do .PERIOD 
now we're going to look at the hot spots .PERIOD 
we say yes ,COMMA we shake our heads no .PERIOD 
and we're going to see that in several videos moving forward ,COMMA but we're going to start - for those of you who don't know him ,COMMA this is presidential candidate john edwards who shocked america by fathering a child out of wedlock .PERIOD 
but i'm happy to participate in one .PERIOD 
it's the only asymmetrical expression .PERIOD 
and these were surfaced by researcher david matsumoto in california .PERIOD 
and you'll see when you see the video ,COMMA she can't even pretend to be an agonizing mother .PERIOD 
diane downs :COLON at night when i close my eyes ,COMMA i can see christie reaching her hand out to me while i'm driving ,COMMA and the blood just kept coming out of her mouth .PERIOD 
now i'm going to show you a video of an actual grieving mother ,COMMA erin runnion ,COMMA confronting her daughter's murderer and torturer in court .PERIOD 
now the technology around what the truth looks like is progressing on ,COMMA the science of it .PERIOD 
i do now ,COMMA after learning about all the quantum stuff .PERIOD 
they fight ,COMMA they get back up ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK wouldn't this be cool ?QUESTIONMARK 
this is a clay maker .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA how - why would a kid want a dinosaur ?QUESTIONMARK 
you can see how old this stuff is .PERIOD 
and i'm really not very good at it .PERIOD 
this is a - you can see the little window there .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this is a quick tale i'm going to tell .PERIOD this is the furby tale .PERIOD 
so this is my family .PERIOD 
i try to do a lot of philosophy ,COMMA a lot of thinking about all of these projects .PERIOD 
you can see the little bb in the box is my tilt sensor .PERIOD 
i just basically gnawed all this stuff out of plastic .PERIOD 
he didn't test so well ,COMMA but i like him .PERIOD 
and then she started doing these other images .PERIOD 
i have three girls and they just ,COMMA they - it's like a rescue animal thing they're going there .PERIOD 
and on the weekend we ran the parts for that .PERIOD 
so this is how they come out close to the end .PERIOD 
for a while ,COMMA they were making two million furbys a month .PERIOD 
and she still actually has those .PERIOD 
and we're going to try to really pull this off ,COMMA intentfully try to make something that seems like it's alive .PERIOD 
and you could actually find full fossil evidence of these .PERIOD 
very ,COMMA very obsessive .PERIOD 
and then more sculpting ,COMMA and then more sculpting ,COMMA and then more sculpting ,COMMA and then more sculpting .PERIOD 
john ,COMMA do you want to bring him up ?QUESTIONMARK 
yeah ,COMMA they're like kids ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
that's what the investors think ,COMMA that it's just - - right ,COMMA right .PERIOD so they're really sweet little guys .PERIOD 
now these are not robots ,COMMA they're kind of lovebots ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
we - actually ,COMMA it's very hard to keep people from doing this .PERIOD 
and there's a lot of social responsibility in that .PERIOD 
if they can do that ,COMMA why can't governments and ngos do the same thing ?QUESTIONMARK 
so that's why i took a bit of time to study coke .PERIOD 
they have this very continuous feedback loop .PERIOD 
they said ,COMMA you roll the ball ,COMMA you hear some pins go down .PERIOD 
it's dark ,COMMA you can't see which one goes down until the lights come on ,COMMA and then you an see your impact .PERIOD 
real-time data turns on the lights .PERIOD 
they set them up as what they called micro-distribution centers ,COMMA and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people ,COMMA who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows to sell the product .PERIOD 
the government noticed in ethiopia that many of the people were so far away from a health clinic ,COMMA they were over a day's travel away from a health clinic .PERIOD 
the third component of coke's success is marketing .PERIOD 
let's listen to this song that coke created for it ,COMMA wavin' flag by a somali hip hop artist .PERIOD 
and it went number one on the pop chart in <NUM> countries .PERIOD 
i've even seen it used for a chicken coop .PERIOD 
we know that circumcision reduces hiv infection by <NUM> percent in men .PERIOD 
but it turns out the men do ,COMMA because they're hearing from their girlfriends that they prefer it ,COMMA and the men also believe it improves their sex life .PERIOD 
so what's the endgame ?QUESTIONMARK 
so if coke's marketers came to me and asked me to define happiness ,COMMA i'd say my vision of happiness is a mother holding healthy baby in her arms .PERIOD 
to me ,COMMA that is deep happiness .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
this is my baseline :COLON this is the mediterranean coast with no fish ,COMMA bare rock and lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae .PERIOD 
this is their baseline .PERIOD this is what they think is natural because we started modern science with scuba diving long after we started degrading marine ecosystems .PERIOD 
what have we learned from these places ?QUESTIONMARK 
when we went to pristine reefs ,COMMA we realized that the natural world was upside down ;SEMICOLON this pyramid was inverted .PERIOD 
the top head does account for most of the biomass ,COMMA in some places up to <NUM> percent ,COMMA like kingman reef ,COMMA which is now protected .PERIOD 
then you go to palmyra atoll that has more biomass of herbivores ,COMMA and the dead corals are clean ,COMMA and the corals are coming back .PERIOD 
and this is what i saw ,COMMA lots of fish .PERIOD 
and this particular place ,COMMA the medes islands marine reserve ,COMMA is only <NUM> hectares ,COMMA and it brings <NUM> million euros to the local economy ,COMMA <NUM> times more than fishing ,COMMA and it represents <NUM> percent of all the tourist revenue .PERIOD 
these places ,COMMA when we protect them ,COMMA if we compare them to unprotected areas nearby ,COMMA this is what happens .PERIOD 
the abundance ,COMMA how many fish you have per square meter ,COMMA increases almost <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
if you fish less ,COMMA you're actually catching more .PERIOD 
another example :COLON nassau groupers in belize in the mesoamerican reef .PERIOD 
when i went there for the first time in <NUM> ,COMMA there were only <NUM> groupers left .PERIOD 
it happened in many places around the caribbean .PERIOD 
so how much of this do we have ?QUESTIONMARK 
people are losing their jobs because the fisheries are collapsing .PERIOD 
the problem is that we can create these large reserves only in places where there are no people ,COMMA where there is no social conflict ,COMMA where the political cost is really low and the economic cost is also low .PERIOD 
but what about the rest of the coast of the world ,COMMA where people live and make a living out of fishing ?QUESTIONMARK 
how could <NUM> percent survive on <NUM> percent ?QUESTIONMARK 
the animals at the lower parts of the food chain ,COMMA they reproduce very fast ;SEMICOLON they grow really fast ;SEMICOLON they produce millions of eggs .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA really ,COMMA our picture of a food pyramid is just - we have to change that completely .PERIOD 
we think this is universal .PERIOD 
so the numbers you presented really are astonishing .PERIOD 
talk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced of going to these pristine areas and seeing things coming back .PERIOD 
and if it were not for these places that show hope ,COMMA i don't think i could continue doing this job .PERIOD 
and the problem ,COMMA i think ,COMMA is that we take the ocean for granted .PERIOD 
most of the animals are in the oceans .PERIOD 
we use the submarine alvin and we use cameras ,COMMA and the cameras are something that bill lange has developed with the help of sony .PERIOD 
marcel proust said ,COMMA the true voyage of discovery is not so much in seeking new landscapes as in having new eyes .PERIOD 
it's got tentacles dangling ,COMMA swirling around like that .PERIOD 
and these are the types of animals that live in that three-dimensional space ,COMMA that micro-gravity environment that we really haven't explored .PERIOD 
they're very little understood .PERIOD 
they go from a couple of inches to a couple of feet .PERIOD 
it's footage that we've collected for scientific purposes .PERIOD 
and we're over the atlantic - that's the ridge right there - but we're going to go across the caribbean ,COMMA central america ,COMMA and end up against the pacific ,COMMA nine degrees north .PERIOD 
here's where bill's cameras really do shine .PERIOD 
and what you're seeing here is a cloud of densely packed ,COMMA hydrogen-sulfide-rich water coming out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor .PERIOD 
not only is it coming out of the earth - so ,COMMA biogenesis made from volcanic activity - but that bacteria supports these colonies of life .PERIOD 
a mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles - no sun has ever gotten down here .PERIOD 
oh !EXCLAMATIONMARK good going .PERIOD 
this is a female of this kind of worm .PERIOD 
you watch .PERIOD it doesn't take long before two guys here - this one and one that will show up over here - start to fight .PERIOD 
the red dot is the laser light of the submarine alvin to give us an idea about how far away we are from the vents .PERIOD 
it's actually a light-sensing organ .PERIOD 
this one's several stories tall .PERIOD 
this stuff is toxic as hell ,COMMA by the way .PERIOD 
that's probably where we evolved from .PERIOD 
there's a fish sitting here .PERIOD 
here's a crab with his claw right at the end of that tube worm ,COMMA waiting for that worm to stick his head out .PERIOD 
the worms are growing inches per week !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
despite that ,COMMA these animals grow back in about a year's time .PERIOD 
learn to manage it .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i'd like to talk about why that is ,COMMA why that's such a calamity for society ,COMMA what we can do about it and ,COMMA to close with ,COMMA why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher .PERIOD 
this is really destructive .PERIOD 
david milch ,COMMA creator of deadwood and other amazing tv shows ,COMMA has a really good description for this .PERIOD 
you expect sitcom-sized problems that wrap up in <NUM> minutes ,COMMA three commercial breaks and a laugh track .PERIOD 
in all seriousness .PERIOD here's an example from a physics textbook .PERIOD 
i'm sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that .PERIOD 
so i can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math .PERIOD 
the math serves the conversation ,COMMA the conversation doesn't serve the math .PERIOD 
i like this question .PERIOD it's about a water tank .PERIOD 
i've got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation .PERIOD 
we need more patient problem solvers .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD 
because actually radical innovation does sometimes come from the very best ,COMMA but it often comes from places where you have huge need - unmet ,COMMA latent demand - and not enough resources for traditional solutions to work - traditional ,COMMA high-cost solutions ,COMMA which depend on professionals ,COMMA which is what schools and hospitals are .PERIOD 
we'll grow by six cities of <NUM> million people a year for the next <NUM> years .PERIOD 
this is where you'll find the fastest growing young populations of the world .PERIOD 
or you can go to places like this .PERIOD 
this is kibera ,COMMA which is the largest slum in east africa .PERIOD 
millions of people living here ,COMMA stretched over many kilometers .PERIOD 
they're private schools .PERIOD there are no state schools in slums .PERIOD 
it's not to do with electricity or water .PERIOD 
if you want to design from scratch virtually any service in africa ,COMMA you would start now with the mobile phone .PERIOD 
this is a place called the madangiri settlement colony ,COMMA which is a very developed slum about <NUM> minutes outside new delhi ,COMMA where i met these characters who showed me around for the day .PERIOD 
ten years ago ,COMMA they certainly would have been married .PERIOD 
this is the best you can get in hyderabad in indian education .PERIOD 
but they find it completely obvious to use computers ,COMMA websites ,COMMA make videos ,COMMA so on and so forth .PERIOD 
one is to deliver extrinsic motivation ,COMMA that education has a payoff .PERIOD 
that's too long if you're poor .PERIOD 
so you need education to be relevant and help people to make a living there and then ,COMMA often .PERIOD 
our education systems ,COMMA you do all that stuff afterward ,COMMA if you're lucky ,COMMA sport ,COMMA drama ,COMMA music .PERIOD 
so el sistema in venezuela uses a violin as a technology of learning .PERIOD 
taio rocha uses making soap as a technology of learning .PERIOD 
and i learned it from this guy ,COMMA who is an amazing character .PERIOD 
and it also supports working-class kids going into indian schools .PERIOD 
and it's the same wherever you go .PERIOD 
it's reliable and people know exactly where they are .PERIOD 
why can't we do it more like the chinese restaurants ?QUESTIONMARK 
there are big picture schools in the u.s. and australia .PERIOD 
but because so many of the issues in education aren't just in school ,COMMA they're in family and community ,COMMA what you also need ,COMMA definitely ,COMMA is more on the right hand side .PERIOD 
you need efforts to supplement schools .PERIOD 
that's an entire second adult lifetime that's been added to our lifespan .PERIOD 
but many people today - philosophers ,COMMA artists ,COMMA doctors ,COMMA scientists - are taking a new look at what i call the third act ,COMMA the last three decades of life .PERIOD 
they realize that this is actually a developmental stage of life with its own significance - as different from midlife as adolescence is from childhood .PERIOD 
i've spent the last year researching and writing about this subject .PERIOD 
obviously ,COMMA there's no guarantee that it can be a time of fruition and growth .PERIOD 
it was about a man named neil selinger - <NUM> years old ,COMMA a retired lawyer - who had joined the writers group at sarah lawrence where he found his writer's voice .PERIOD 
it's a terrible disease .PERIOD it's fatal .PERIOD 
if however ,COMMA we can go back and alter our relationship ,COMMA re-vision our relationship to past people and events ,COMMA neural pathways can change .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA as girls ,COMMA we start off feisty - yeah ,COMMA who says ?QUESTIONMARK 
we have agency .PERIOD 
but very often ,COMMA many ,COMMA if not most of us ,COMMA when we hit puberty ,COMMA we start worrying about fitting in and being popular .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
but most species actually use insects to do their bidding ,COMMA and that's more intelligent in a way ,COMMA because the pollen ,COMMA they don't need so much of it .PERIOD 
the insects and other species can take the pollen ,COMMA transfer it directly to where it's required .PERIOD 
there are markings on many plants that look like other insects .PERIOD 
these are the anthers of a lily ,COMMA cleverly done so that when the unsuspecting insect lands on it ,COMMA the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with .PERIOD 
and basically what the insect has to do - we're in the middle of the flower - it has to stick its little proboscis right into the middle of that and all the way down that nectar tube to get to the nectar .PERIOD 
so not only has the fly not got the nectar from the mimic plant ,COMMA it's also - if you look very closely just at the head end ,COMMA you can see that it's got a bit of pollen that it would be transmitting to another plant ,COMMA if only some botanist hadn't come along and stuck it to a blue piece of card .PERIOD 
and when the insect gets there and lands on it ,COMMA dousing itself in pollen ,COMMA of course ,COMMA that it's going to take to another plant ,COMMA if you look at the every-home-should-have-one scanning electron microscope picture ,COMMA you can see that there are actually some patterning there ,COMMA which is three-dimensional .PERIOD 
sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect ,COMMA even to us .PERIOD 
so flies love this .PERIOD 
they lay their eggs in it ,COMMA thinking it's a nice bit of carrion ,COMMA and not realizing that there's no food for the eggs ,COMMA that the eggs are going to die ,COMMA but the plant ,COMMA meanwhile ,COMMA has benefited ,COMMA because the bristles release and the flies disappear to pollinate the next flower - fantastic .PERIOD 
this thing does something else which is unusual .PERIOD 
recently ,COMMA a wise media theorist tweeted ,COMMA the <NUM> century culture was defined by the novel ,COMMA the <NUM> century culture was defined by the cinema ,COMMA and the culture of the <NUM> century will be defined by the interface .PERIOD

after previewing it and confirming it's what you submitted ,COMMA you could submit it into the mechanical turk with no other context .PERIOD 
i'm sorry for this .PERIOD 
and this was seen by a director in l.a. named james frost who said ,COMMA wait a minute .PERIOD 
and i think one of my favorite parts of this project was not just shooting a video with lasers ,COMMA but we also open sourced it ,COMMA and we made it released as a google code project ,COMMA where people could download a bunch of the data and some source code to build their own versions of it .PERIOD 
so we thought this was the perfect project to build a collaborative memorial and a virtual resurrection for johnny cash .PERIOD 
collaborator five :COLON as much as is different from frame to frame ,COMMA it really is personal .PERIOD

snobbery is a global phenomenon .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the opposite of a snob is your mother .PERIOD

we're told ,COMMA from many sources ,COMMA that anyone can achieve anything .PERIOD 
we are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position they please .PERIOD 
they own their success .PERIOD but they also own their failure .PERIOD

when banking is no longer so respectable ,COMMA we lose interest in banking .PERIOD 
but what i really want to stress is by all means ,COMMA success ,COMMA yes .PERIOD

and i gathered together ,COMMA honestly ,COMMA the world's leading experts in every possible way .PERIOD 
and a month ago ,COMMA the <NUM> of september ,COMMA i stood on that shore and i looked across to that long ,COMMA long faraway horizon and i asked myself ,COMMA do you have it ?QUESTIONMARK 
you're really left alone with your own thoughts .PERIOD 
first of all ,COMMA you're going to hit obstacles .PERIOD

henry ,COMMA what's your question ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i said ,COMMA well it's odd that you've learned of this as a noble kind of pursuit ,COMMA but yeah ,COMMA i know those guys .PERIOD 
he said ,COMMA that's what you need .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
this hope is still alive .PERIOD 
are you going to swim the atlantic ?QUESTIONMARK 
i said ,COMMA nope .PERIOD i didn't know .PERIOD 
and i left everything and went for a long series of odd jobs .PERIOD 
they come in a lot of different shapes .PERIOD 
so i'm always looking for the false cognates or identical words in different languages .PERIOD 
so i did a series of work where it was identical words in french and in english .PERIOD 
so if you don't know one of these languages ,COMMA it's instant learning .PERIOD 
it's all if .PERIOD 
and we can use them also as a safety net .PERIOD 
people tell me their lives ,COMMA their memories ,COMMA their aspirations ,COMMA and i create a mindscape .PERIOD 
i was also interested in the physicality of this format ,COMMA because you have to walk to see it .PERIOD 
so it's like the different layers of what we are made of and what we present to the world as an identity .PERIOD 
why do i call it a book ?QUESTIONMARK 
after eight years of rejection ,COMMA i was thrilled to get my first commission with the percent for art in new york city .PERIOD 
here it's faceted glass in the bronx .PERIOD 
because if you sit a long time in summer in shorts ,COMMA you will walk away with temporary branding of the story element on your thighs .PERIOD 
it's a story about transformation and connections .PERIOD 
and here i've been working for the last three years with a south bronx developer to bring art to life to low-income buildings and affordable housing .PERIOD 
and i wanted to give them an escape .PERIOD 
but the result is always to have stories .PERIOD 
and you get to think about yourself and your memories ,COMMA and before you go back into suspension ,COMMA you edit your memories and you change your personality and so forth .PERIOD 
but lots of people now live to <NUM> or <NUM> ,COMMA unless they shake hands too much or something like that .PERIOD 
which ,COMMA by chimpanzee standards ,COMMA is very good indeed .PERIOD 
and i guess i better skip all the rest of this ,COMMA which are some details on how we might make those smart machines and - - and the main idea is in fact that the core of a really smart machine is one that recognizes that a certain kind of problem is facing you .PERIOD 
any guesses ?QUESTIONMARK <NUM> .PERIOD 
what has changed our society has been wireless devices .PERIOD 
this is the first one .PERIOD this is an electrocardiogram .PERIOD 
in the future you're going to be checking all your vital signs ,COMMA all your vital signs :COLON your heart rhythm ,COMMA your blood pressure ,COMMA your oxygen ,COMMA your temperature ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
if you're an expectant parent ,COMMA what about the ability to monitor ,COMMA continuously ,COMMA fetal heart rate ,COMMA or intrauterine contractions ,COMMA and not having to worry so much that things are fine as the pregnancy ,COMMA and moving over into the time of delivery ?QUESTIONMARK 
and then as we go further ,COMMA today we have continuous glucose sensors .PERIOD 
i didn't have one of those ,COMMA but i got the fitbit .PERIOD

now ,COMMA diabetes is one of the big ones .PERIOD 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .PERIOD 
one of the ones i just wanted to mention :COLON the ishoe is another example of a sensor that improves proprioception among the elderly to prevent falling .PERIOD 
one of them - we're very fortunate - is to develop a dedicated institute and that's work that started with the work that scripps with qualcomm .PERIOD

none of the techniques that these people have developed over the course of the last <NUM> years is in any of those books .PERIOD 
is there a way we can show people food in a way they have not seen it before ?QUESTIONMARK 
then each of the different little pieces around it explain some fact .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA that first cutaway picture worked ,COMMA so we said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA let's do some more .PERIOD 
once you start cutting things in half ,COMMA you kind of get carried away ,COMMA so you see we cut the jars in half as well as the pan .PERIOD 
and each of these text blocks explains a key thing that's going on .PERIOD 
but to make them palatable ,COMMA we cut it out of a steel plate and put it in front of a fire and photographed it like this .PERIOD 
everybody knows that your various appliances have wattage ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
as it comes out of the grinder ,COMMA you just have a little tray ,COMMA and you just take it off in little passes ,COMMA build it up ,COMMA slice it vertically .PERIOD 
now watch closely .PERIOD this is popcorn .PERIOD i'll explain it here .PERIOD 
the popcorn is illustrating a key thing in physics .PERIOD 
but surgeons in these eras are a little bit more conservative than their bold ,COMMA trephinating ancestors .PERIOD 
and he is credited with doing over <NUM> of these public surgeries ,COMMA wandering around in europe ,COMMA which is an astonishing number ,COMMA when you think that surgery must have been a last resort .PERIOD 
joseph lister was aepsis's ,COMMA or sterility's ,COMMA biggest advocate ,COMMA to a very very skeptical bunch of surgeons .PERIOD 
the mayo brothers came out to visit lister in europe .PERIOD 
something so simple .PERIOD 
laparoscopy is doing this kind of surgery :COLON surgery with long instruments through small incisions .PERIOD 
but there were casualties of this revolution .PERIOD 
they had to give up their wrists .PERIOD 
they had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA what you put between those instruments and those hands ,COMMA is a large ,COMMA fairly complicated robot .PERIOD 
and since this was introduced in <NUM> ,COMMA a lot of these robots have been out and being used for surgical procedures like a prostatectomy ,COMMA which is a prostate deep in the pelvis ,COMMA and it requires fine dissection and delicate manipulation to be able to get a good surgical outcome .PERIOD 
more useful than a solid gold surgeon ,COMMA but ,COMMA still ,COMMA it's a fairly big capital investment .PERIOD 
it has to be able to come off of the centerline and then be able to work back toward that centerline .PERIOD 
it's not so simple .PERIOD 
for the patient ,COMMA however ,COMMA it's transparent .PERIOD this is all they're going to see .PERIOD 
it's very exciting to think where we get to go with this .PERIOD 
as we take these capabilities ,COMMA and we get to go to the next places ,COMMA we get to decide what our new surgeries are going to be .PERIOD 
and i think to really get the rest of the way in that revolution ,COMMA we need to not just take our hands in in new ways ,COMMA we also need to take our eyes in in new ways .PERIOD 
we need to see beyond the surface .PERIOD 
you know for me ,COMMA the interest in contemporary forms of slavery started with a leaflet that i picked up in london .PERIOD 
and i'm going to admit to hubris .PERIOD 
it was mind-blowing .PERIOD 
but in fact that kind of bluey color are the countries where we can't find any cases of slavery .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA it builds up with these factors .PERIOD 
add in the increased vulnerability of very large numbers of people in the developing world ,COMMA caused by civil wars ,COMMA ethnic conflicts ,COMMA kleptocratic governments ,COMMA disease .PERIOD you name it ,COMMA you know it .PERIOD 
but if corruption creeps in and people don't have the opportunity to have that protection of the rule of law ,COMMA then if you can use violence ,COMMA if you can use violence with impunity ,COMMA you can reach out and harvest the vulnerable into slavery .PERIOD 
all around the world i've been told an almost identical story .PERIOD 
they said ,COMMA that guy looked sketchy .PERIOD i was suspicious ,COMMA but my children were hungry .PERIOD 
we needed medicine .PERIOD 
ten miles ,COMMA <NUM> miles ,COMMA <NUM> miles later ,COMMA they find themselves in dirty ,COMMA dangerous ,COMMA demeaning work .PERIOD 
africans and indians ,COMMA as usual ,COMMA south americans ,COMMA and eastern europeans in particular are on our buy list .PERIOD 
d :COLON interesting .PERIOD micheal ,COMMA bottom line ,COMMA what do you recommend ?QUESTIONMARK 
kevin bales :COLON okay ,COMMA you figured it out .PERIOD that's a spoof .PERIOD 
slaves cost between <NUM> to <NUM> dollars in north america ,COMMA but i could take you places in india or nepal where human beings can be acquired for five or <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
they key here is that people have ceased to be that capital purchase item and become like styrofoam cups .PERIOD 
you buy them cheaply ,COMMA you use them ,COMMA you crumple them up ,COMMA and then when you're done with them you just throw them away .PERIOD 
i've got to say ,COMMA one of the most exciting parts about my job is that i get to ,COMMA and i want to introduce you to one of those .PERIOD 
this is not james ,COMMA this is one of the kids that he works with .PERIOD 
and it can be done .PERIOD 
liberation ,COMMA and more importantly all the work that comes after liberation .PERIOD 
this is what liberation really looks like .PERIOD 
she said ,COMMA no ,COMMA because we've got hope now .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA thank you so much .PERIOD 
despite the new york times' and vanity fair's best efforts recently ,COMMA they're not brothers .PERIOD 
this is actually a training film for a clown college that they had .PERIOD 
there is a picture of charles .PERIOD so let's watch the next clip .PERIOD 
but people live on this land .PERIOD 
so what we're going to see is some of the icons of eames furniture .PERIOD 
and i'm really here to talk about design .PERIOD 
and this is a little film i made about the making of the eames lounge chair .PERIOD 
because it just kind of ,COMMA you know ,COMMA doesn't get any more basic than that .PERIOD 
this is a relatively famous chair .PERIOD 
but doing these splints they learned a lot about the manufacturing process ,COMMA which was incredibly important to them .PERIOD 
i'm trying to show you too much ,COMMA because i want you to really get a broth of ideas and images .PERIOD 
this is a house that charles and ray designed .PERIOD 
my sister is chasing someone else .PERIOD it's not me .PERIOD 
although i endorse heartily the fact that he stole her diary ,COMMA it's not me .PERIOD 
the house is <NUM> .PERIOD 
and now i'm going to test you .PERIOD 
i hope you had a nice time at buddy's party .PERIOD 
and they honor events in the linear world from the fictional world .PERIOD 
and then embassy row is actually a historical site ,COMMA because in the kymaerican story this is where the parisian diaspora started ,COMMA where there embassy was .PERIOD 
and the town has really embraced it .PERIOD 
and you're kind of trapped in the texture of kymaerica .PERIOD 
and this is cranbrook .PERIOD i've got a real treat for you ,COMMA which is the first film that charles ever made .PERIOD 
and he made it for the <NUM> faculty exhibition .PERIOD 
you want to learn how to make films ?QUESTIONMARK go make a movie .PERIOD 
so my point is that this scope of vision ,COMMA this holistic vision of design ,COMMA was with them from the beginning .PERIOD 
it wasn't like oh ,COMMA we made some chairs and got successful .PERIOD 
so we're going to do the last clip .PERIOD 
and part of why this stuff is important and all the things that we do are important ,COMMA is that these are the ideas we need .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA working on the idea that the cheapest electric toaster would also be the simplest to reverse-engineer ,COMMA i went and bought the cheapest toaster i could find ,COMMA took it home and was kind of dismayed to discover that ,COMMA inside this object ,COMMA which i'd bought for just <NUM> pounds ,COMMA there were <NUM> different bits made out of a hundred-plus different materials .PERIOD 
can i come up and get some iron ?QUESTIONMARK 
but after some nagging ,COMMA i got him to do that .PERIOD 
but instead of a bellows ,COMMA i had a leaf blower .PERIOD 
plastic is the defining feature of cheap electrical goods .PERIOD 
and you can actually make plastic from obviously oils which come from plants ,COMMA but also from starches .PERIOD 
so this is attempting to make potato starch plastic .PERIOD 
and it was looking good for a while ,COMMA but i left it outside ,COMMA because you had to leave it outside to dry ,COMMA and unfortunately i came back and there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato .PERIOD 
so kind of out of desperation ,COMMA i decided that i could think laterally .PERIOD 
and there it is on the shelves .PERIOD 
i don't know if you could see ,COMMA but i was never able to make insulation for the wires .PERIOD 
they were trying to catch fish .PERIOD 
however ,COMMA the report focused on what had already occurred and offered no information on what to expect now .PERIOD 
voice <NUM> :COLON it's coming again .PERIOD voice <NUM> :COLON new wave ?QUESTIONMARK 
you know ,COMMA if you think about something like google ,COMMA which essentially is relying on the collective intelligence of the web to seek out those sites that have the most valuable information - we know that google does an exceptionally good job of doing that ,COMMA and it does that because ,COMMA collectively ,COMMA this disorganized thing we call the world wide web actually has a remarkable order ,COMMA or a remarkable intelligence in it .PERIOD 
but what the blogosphere offers is the possibility of getting at the kind of collective ,COMMA distributive intelligence that is out there ,COMMA and that we know is available to us if we can just figure out a way of accessing it .PERIOD 
a network is not just the product of its component parts .PERIOD 
it is something more than that .PERIOD 
and that phenomenon of piling on the existing links is one that is characteristic of the blogosphere ,COMMA particularly of the political blogosphere ,COMMA and it is one that essentially throws off this beautiful ,COMMA decentralized ,COMMA bottom-up intelligence that blogs can manifest in the right conditions .PERIOD 
when we talk about bottom-up ,COMMA decentralized phenomena ,COMMA the ant colony is the classic metaphor ,COMMA because ,COMMA no individual ant knows what it's doing ,COMMA but collectively ants are able to reach incredibly intelligent decisions .PERIOD 
but the pace of exponential growth is really what describes information technologies .PERIOD 
it makes a huge difference .PERIOD 
and moore's law was not the first paradigm to bring exponential growth to computing .PERIOD 
when that comes to an end we'll go to the sixth paradigm ;SEMICOLON three-dimensional self-organizing molecular circuits .PERIOD 
the great depression made not a dent in this exponential progression .PERIOD 
and i was asked ,COMMA well aren't you nervous ?QUESTIONMARK 
and the cost of a transistor cycle ,COMMA which is a measure of the price performance of electronics ,COMMA comes down about every year .PERIOD 
but that was really right on schedule .PERIOD 
communication technologies :COLON <NUM> different ways to measure this ,COMMA the number of bits being moved around ,COMMA the size of the internet .PERIOD 
some critics say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA well software is stuck in the mud .PERIOD 
when i was a student it was across campus ,COMMA now it's in our pockets .PERIOD 
all the intellectual property that is created and taught will be online and available ,COMMA and developed online in a collaborative fashion .PERIOD 
here is our founding meeting .PERIOD 
so we're very appreciative of the support we've gotten from both the intellectual leaders ,COMMA the high-tech leaders ,COMMA particularly google and nasa .PERIOD 
whole arm .PERIOD shoulder disarticulation .PERIOD 
not in an envelope of a human arm ,COMMA with <NUM> degrees of freedom ,COMMA from your shoulder to your fingertips .PERIOD 
you think it's bad to lose one arm ?QUESTIONMARK 
we have <NUM> out of the <NUM> degrees of freedom ;SEMICOLON you don't need the ones in the last two fingers .PERIOD 
a couple of weeks ago we took it down to walter reed ,COMMA which is unfortunately more in the news these days .PERIOD 
it's going to go inside something that we use in cat scans and mris of whatever is their good arm ,COMMA to make silicon rubber ,COMMA then coat it ,COMMA and paint it in <NUM> - exact mirror image of their other limb .PERIOD 
this weighs <NUM> pounds .PERIOD 
now he's going to pick up a pen with his opposed thumb and index finger .PERIOD 
that's about <NUM> percent of our global needs and <NUM> percent of some island nations .PERIOD 
it all began when two scientists ,COMMA fred grassle and jesse ausubel ,COMMA met in woods hole ,COMMA massachusetts where both were guests at the famed oceanographic institute .PERIOD 
they ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA are an endangered species themselves .PERIOD 
so fishermen could only catch what they could either eat or sell that day .PERIOD 
but this is no laughing matter .PERIOD 
that's the sort of technology that's available today that really wasn't available even a decade ago .PERIOD 
and so for animals that come to the surface to breathe ,COMMA such as this elephant seal ,COMMA it's an opportunity to send data back to shore and tell us where exactly it is in the ocean .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA the dark blue shows you where the elephant seal moved in the north pacific .PERIOD 
for animals that don't surface ,COMMA we have something called pop-up tags ,COMMA which collect data about light and what time the sun rises and sets .PERIOD 
geneticists have developed a similar tool called genetic barcoding .PERIOD 
and so they put this together ,COMMA a list of all the species ,COMMA where they're known to occur ,COMMA and it really seemed like a very esoteric ,COMMA scientific type of exercise .PERIOD 
so all of a sudden ,COMMA this labor of love for no obvious economic reason has become a critical piece of information in terms of how that system is going to recover ,COMMA how long it will take and how the lawsuits and the multi-billion-dollar discussions that are going to happen in the coming years are likely to be resolved .PERIOD 
you can do this on a global scale ,COMMA but you can also do it on a regional scale .PERIOD 
now while a lot of the species we discovered in the census are things that are small and hard to see ,COMMA that certainly wasn't always the case .PERIOD 
similarly this golden v kelp collected in alaska just below the low water mark is probably a new species .PERIOD 
this particular shrimp ,COMMA we've dubbed it the jurassic shrimp ,COMMA it's thought to have gone extinct <NUM> years ago - at least it was ,COMMA until the census discovered it was living and doing just fine off the coast of australia .PERIOD 
now this little critter ,COMMA it's only about half a millimeter in size ,COMMA not terribly charismatic .PERIOD 
and we also found this spectacular yeti crab that lives near boiling hot hydrothermal vents at easter island .PERIOD 
that means <NUM> percent ,COMMA even after the census ,COMMA still remain to be discovered .PERIOD 
but the really intriguing thing about the microbes is just how diverse they are .PERIOD 
a single drop of seawater could contain <NUM> different types of microbes .PERIOD 
the other point i'd like to make about this is that this ocean's interconnected .PERIOD 
census scientists worked in the rain ,COMMA they worked in the cold ,COMMA they worked under water and they worked above water trying to illuminate the wondrous discovery ,COMMA the still vast unknown ,COMMA the spectacular adaptations that we see in ocean life .PERIOD 
so whether you're a yak herder living in the mountains of chile ,COMMA whether you're a stockbroker in new york city or whether you're a tedster living in edinburgh ,COMMA the oceans matter .PERIOD 
♫ i could show the world how to smile ,COMMA ♫ ♫ i could be glad all of the while .PERIOD ♫ ♫ i could turn the gray skies to blue ,COMMA if i had you .PERIOD ♫ ♫ i could leave the old days behind ,COMMA ♫ ♫ leave all my pals ,COMMA i ’ d never mind .PERIOD ♫ ♫ i could start my life all anew ,COMMA if i had you .PERIOD ♫ ♫ i could climb the snow-capped mountains ,COMMA ♫ ♫ sail the mighty ocean wide .PERIOD ♫ ♫ i could cross the burning desert ,COMMA if i had you by my side .PERIOD ♫ ♫ i could be a king ,COMMA dear ,COMMA uncrowned ,COMMA humble or poor ,COMMA rich or renowned .PERIOD ♫ ♫ there is nothing i couldn ’ t do ,COMMA if i had you .PERIOD ♫ thank you .PERIOD well ,COMMA thank you so much .PERIOD 
and there's a cause for that ,COMMA all right .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA it's been around for <NUM> years .PERIOD 
and we do something different than what we did in the past ;SEMICOLON we add kind of a modicum of intelligence to that .PERIOD 
if there are <NUM> operations ,COMMA you know that none of them work .PERIOD 
you've heard that word several times in the last four days ,COMMA and everyone's familiar with kuhnian paradigms .PERIOD 
and by the human spirit ,COMMA i don't mean anything divine ,COMMA i don't mean anything supernatural - certainly not coming from this skeptic .PERIOD 
what i mean is this ability that each of us has to be something greater than herself or himself ;SEMICOLON to arise out of our ordinary selves and achieve something that at the beginning we thought perhaps we were not capable of .PERIOD 
there has certainly been no argument about that in this room in the past four days .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA if we are to be the world's healer ,COMMA every disadvantaged person in this world - including in the united states - becomes our patient .PERIOD 
i would like to quote one of my own household gods .PERIOD 
think about it .PERIOD 
rudimentary animal ,COMMA has a nervous system ,COMMA swims around in the ocean in its juvenile life .PERIOD 
if you put a five year-old child's dexterity against the best robots of today ,COMMA the answer is simple :COLON the child wins easily .PERIOD 
when it comes to being dexterous ,COMMA it's not even clear what the algorithm is you have to solve to be dexterous .PERIOD 
but let me show you cutting-edge robotics .PERIOD 
now the americans in the audience will know all about cup stacking .PERIOD 
and it sounds like an easy problem .PERIOD 
so the old days before digital radio when you were tuning in your radio and you heard crrcckkk on the station you wanted to hear ,COMMA that was the noise .PERIOD 
so if you're lucky enough to be able to knock a small white ball into a hole several hundred yards away using a long metal stick ,COMMA our society will be willing to reward you with hundreds of millions of dollars .PERIOD 
but we're going to represent beliefs with probabilities .PERIOD 
but there's another source of information ,COMMA and that's effectively prior knowledge .PERIOD 
but you know that your senses are not perfect ,COMMA and therefore there's some variability of where it's going to land shown by that cloud of red ,COMMA representing numbers between <NUM> and maybe <NUM> .PERIOD 
that information is available in the current shot ,COMMA but there's another source of information not available on the current shot ,COMMA but only available by repeated experience in the game of tennis ,COMMA and that's that the ball doesn't bounce with equal probability over the court during the match .PERIOD 
as we go around ,COMMA we learn about statistics of the world and lay that down ,COMMA but we also learn about how noisy our own sensory apparatus is ,COMMA and then combine those in a real bayesian way .PERIOD 
so that really means i have to make predictions of the future .PERIOD 
any discrepancy should hopefully be external .PERIOD 
so as i go around the world ,COMMA i'm making predictions of what i should get ,COMMA subtracting them off .PERIOD 
and we replay that to the other hand with a time delay .PERIOD 
and based on this illustration ,COMMA we really convinced ourselves in the field that the brain's making precise predictions and subtracting them off from the sensations .PERIOD 
so we were looking for a much more objective way to assess this phenomena .PERIOD 
so if they retaliate with the same force ,COMMA the first person will think it's been escalated .PERIOD 
now we don't work with children ,COMMA we don't work with hitting ,COMMA but the concept is identical .PERIOD 
we started with a motor with a little lever ,COMMA a little force transfuser .PERIOD 
so it re-shows the brain makes predictions and fundamentally changes the precepts .PERIOD 
but we've got a problem .PERIOD 
and there's a big gap between the task and the movement system .PERIOD 
i could choose these two paths out of an infinite number of paths .PERIOD 
maybe we don't all quite move the same way .PERIOD 
but there's noise added to this .PERIOD 
so if i pick the same command through many times ,COMMA i will get a different noisy version each time ,COMMA because noise changes each time .PERIOD 
and the fundamental idea is you want to plan your movements so as to minimize the negative consequence of the noise .PERIOD 
so you want to avoid big forces as one principle .PERIOD 
so we've shown that using this ,COMMA we can explain a huge amount of data - that exactly people are going about their lives planning movements so as to minimize negative consequences of noise .PERIOD 
all the conversation stopped .PERIOD all the eyes turned to me .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA what i'd like to do now is to tell you about what we've learned in those journeys .PERIOD 
they put smart skylights through their stores so they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA let me tell you this :COLON when wal-mart achieves <NUM> percent energy reductions ,COMMA that's going to be a very big deal .PERIOD but i'm afraid it's not enough .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA bob said the most important thing we could do right now is to make it clear in sacramento ,COMMA california that we need a market-based system of mandates that's going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in california .PERIOD 
here's a story about national policy that we could all learn from .PERIOD 
they'd run ethanol or ordinary gasoline .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what's happened in brazil is ,COMMA they've replaced <NUM> percent of the gasoline consumed by their automotive fleet with ethanol .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA a team of berkeley researchers with <NUM> million dollars from the gates foundation is engineering ,COMMA designing a radical new way to make the key ingredient ,COMMA called artemisinin ,COMMA and they're going to make that drug <NUM> times cheaper .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA i'll tell you - a lot .PERIOD 
second fact :COLON the president's new budget for renewable energy is barely a billion dollars in total .PERIOD 
third fact :COLON i bet you didn't know that there's enough energy in hot rocks under the country to supply america's energy needs for the next thousand years .PERIOD and the federal budget calls for a measly <NUM> million dollars of r & amp ;SEMICOLON d in geothermal energy .PERIOD 
not enough to stabilize the climate .PERIOD 
not enough to keep the ice in greenland from crashing into the ocean .PERIOD 
we've got to make this economic so that all people and all nations make the right outcome ,COMMA the profitable outcome ,COMMA and therefore the likely outcome .PERIOD 
it is the mother of all markets .PERIOD you remember that internet ?QUESTIONMARK 
she's like ,COMMA oh ,COMMA us .PERIOD i'm like ,COMMA okay .PERIOD all right .PERIOD that's cool .PERIOD 
and there's a dude selling these aftermarket weapons for lego ,COMMA because lego - the danish - no ,COMMA they're not into guns .PERIOD 
but the americans ?QUESTIONMARK oh ,COMMA we'll make some guns for lego ,COMMA no problem .PERIOD 
and at a certain point ,COMMA you look around ,COMMA you're like ,COMMA whoa ,COMMA this is a really nerdy crowd .PERIOD 
i'm kind of into this stuff ,COMMA and i'm going to stop being embarrassed .PERIOD 
and so this is like this cad program where you build it .PERIOD 
i have to take a moment .PERIOD 
there's a whole gray market for lego ,COMMA thousands of home-based businesses .PERIOD 
let's see here .PERIOD 
that's <NUM> million years per minute .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this is frozen water .PERIOD 
the most intriguing and puzzling measurement ,COMMA in my opinion ,COMMA we've obtained of mars ,COMMA was released earlier this year in the magazine science .PERIOD 
and what we're looking at is the presence of the gas methane ,COMMA ch4 ,COMMA in the atmosphere of mars .PERIOD 
that's because the northern hemisphere is the region of the ancient ocean basin .PERIOD 
and that's because the water protected the basin from being impacted by asteroids and meteorites .PERIOD 
here's hellas basin ,COMMA a very very different place ,COMMA geologically .PERIOD 
we addressed on the board the major questions that have not been answered .PERIOD 
and the result of our meeting was a robotic rocket-powered airplane we call ares .PERIOD 
and our goal is to inspire the american public who is paying for this mission through tax dollars .PERIOD 
how do we transport an airplane to mars ?QUESTIONMARK 
and we have it in something called an aeroshell .PERIOD 
because we have tested ares model ,COMMA several models in a half a dozen wind tunnels at the nasa langley research center for eight years ,COMMA under mars conditions .PERIOD 
we're ready to go .PERIOD 
this is the ares team ;SEMICOLON we have about <NUM> scientists ,COMMA engineers ;SEMICOLON where we're working with jet propulsion laboratory ,COMMA goddard space flight center ,COMMA ames research center and half a dozen major universities and corporations in developing this .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
and my colleague ,COMMA james fowler and i have been studying for quite sometime what are the mathematical ,COMMA social ,COMMA biological and psychological rules that govern how these networks are assembled and what are the similar rules that govern how they operate ,COMMA how they affect our lives .PERIOD 
they actually diffuse through networks .PERIOD 
you could have friendship relationships ,COMMA sibling relationships ,COMMA spousal relationships ,COMMA co-worker relationships ,COMMA neighbor relationships and the like .PERIOD 
or their altruistic or their charitable giving behavior might be influenced by their coworkers ,COMMA or by their neighbors .PERIOD 
nicholas christakis :COLON b ,COMMA it's obvious .PERIOD 
and what we show here is - like ,COMMA here - very few people are affected ,COMMA more and more and more and up to here ,COMMA and here's the peak of the epidemic .PERIOD 
and if they nominate the party host as their friend ,COMMA that party host has a hundred friends ,COMMA therefore ,COMMA has more friends than they do .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we thought we would exploit this idea in order to study whether we could predict phenomena within networks .PERIOD 
by monitoring the friends group ,COMMA we could get <NUM> days advance warning of an impending epidemic in this human population .PERIOD 
now in our case ,COMMA although it wasn't necessary ,COMMA we could also actually map the network of the students .PERIOD 
we're going to take daily cuts through the network for <NUM> days .PERIOD 
every dot is a person ,COMMA and every line represents a volume of calls between the people .PERIOD 
and in fact ,COMMA we are in the era of what i would call massive-passive data collection efforts .PERIOD 
they're all kinds of ways we can use massively collected data to create sensor networks to follow the population ,COMMA understand what's happening in the population ,COMMA and intervene in the population for the better .PERIOD 
one is quasi-active ,COMMA like the flu example i gave ,COMMA where we get some people to nominate their friends and then passively monitor their friends - do they have the flu ,COMMA or not ?QUESTIONMARK - and then get warning .PERIOD 
they collect millions of points at a time with very high accuracy and very high resolution .PERIOD 
they were gone in an instant .PERIOD 
the royal tombs had been destroyed by suspected arson .PERIOD 
let me leave you with a final thought .PERIOD 
and that was that an american congresswoman named patricia schroeder from colorado met with a group of journalists .PERIOD 
it will refer you directly to your congressperson ,COMMA to your u.s. senator ,COMMA to your governor where divestment legislation is pending .PERIOD 
for instance ,COMMA the referral of the crimes in darfur to the international criminal court ,COMMA which the bush administration doesn't like .PERIOD 
he moved with the headlines .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA uh-oh ,COMMA the killers are within the camps .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA if you denounce ,COMMA you're probably never going to get back in the room .PERIOD 
you're un-owned .PERIOD 
he started as somebody who would denounce harmdoers ,COMMA he would charge up to people who were violating international law ,COMMA and he would say ,COMMA you're violating ,COMMA this is the u.n. charter .PERIOD 
all the great progress in this country with relation to our adversaries has come by going into the room .PERIOD 
there's going to be a lot of people .PERIOD 
but it never struck me as it did that moment ,COMMA because on that image was a woman trying to nurse her baby ,COMMA and she had no milk to nurse .PERIOD 
a hundred years ago ,COMMA we didn't .PERIOD 
at our time in history ,COMMA these images are out of place .PERIOD 
and here you see a brain scan of two children - one who had adequate nutrition ,COMMA another ,COMMA neglected and who was deeply malnourished .PERIOD 
and so today we focus on not just passing out food ,COMMA but making sure the mothers have enough enrichment ,COMMA and teaching them about breastfeeding .PERIOD 
it doesn't need to be refrigerated ,COMMA it doesn't need water ,COMMA which is often lacking .PERIOD 
eighty percent of the people in the world have no food safety net .PERIOD 
and usually the institutions - churches ,COMMA temples ,COMMA other things - do not have the resources to provide a safety net .PERIOD 
and if you fill the cup with local agriculture from small farmers ,COMMA you have a transformative effect .PERIOD 
many kids in the world can't go to school because they have to go beg and find a meal .PERIOD 
it costs less than <NUM> cents a day to change a kid's life .PERIOD 
families need the help .PERIOD 
so is this a hopeless cause ?QUESTIONMARK 
cameroon ,COMMA northern cameroon ,COMMA boom and bust cycles of hunger every year for decades .PERIOD 
food aid coming in every year when people are starving during the lean seasons .PERIOD 
you manage ,COMMA the village manages these warehouses .PERIOD 
and the food banks are growing .PERIOD 
we're seeing that now in the horn of africa where food prices are up <NUM> percent in some areas over last year .PERIOD 
the shopkeepers are hiring more people .PERIOD 
and they require that a third of that food come from the smallest farmers who would have no opportunity .PERIOD 
i've gone out there ;SEMICOLON i've met with the small farmers who have built their livelihoods on the opportunity and platform provided by this .PERIOD 
you look at the cost-benefit analysis ,COMMA and my dream is to take this issue ,COMMA not just from the compassion argument ,COMMA but to the finance ministers of the world ,COMMA and say we cannot afford to not invest in the access to adequate ,COMMA affordable nutrition for all of humanity .PERIOD 
when a leader says ,COMMA not under my watch ,COMMA everything begins to change .PERIOD 
wfp's been able to leave <NUM> nations because they have transformed the face of hunger in their nations .PERIOD 
not only that ,COMMA transforming hunger is an opportunity ,COMMA but i think we have to change our mindsets .PERIOD 
what's exciting is that over the last two or three years ,COMMA the government has spent <NUM> million dollars ,COMMA and they've allocated another billion dollars ,COMMA to what we call the cancer genome atlas project .PERIOD 
the cancer genome atlas is coming out now .PERIOD 
there's also a field of proteomics that i'll talk about in a few minutes ,COMMA which i think is going to be the next level in terms of understanding and classifying disease .PERIOD 
cancer is an interaction of a cell that no longer is under growth control with the environment .PERIOD 
the goal of me as a cancer doctor is not to understand cancer .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA if i measured your temperature over <NUM> days ,COMMA and i asked ,COMMA what was the average temperature ?QUESTIONMARK 
i mean ,COMMA this is a scary slide ,COMMA not to take an aside ,COMMA but it looks at obesity in the world .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA our systems today are dramatically different than our systems a decade or two ago .PERIOD 
that is the most effective ,COMMA cost-effective ,COMMA best way we can do things today .PERIOD 
sounds are affecting your hormone secretions all the time ,COMMA but also your breathing ,COMMA your heart rate - which i just also did - and your brainwaves .PERIOD 
it has the frequency of roughly <NUM> cycles per minute .PERIOD 
there are eight expressions of a brand in sound .PERIOD 
you all recognize that one .PERIOD this is the most-played tune in the world today .PERIOD 
why are we doing this ?QUESTIONMARK 
the first is ,COMMA it's essential for us to understand the human brain if we do want to get along in society ,COMMA and i think that it is a key step in evolution .PERIOD 
and you may think that anesthetics work by sending you into some deep sleep ,COMMA or by blocking your receptors so that you don't feel pain ,COMMA but in fact most anesthetics don't work that way .PERIOD 
<NUM> percent of what you see is not what comes in through the eyes .PERIOD 
they are highly reactive ,COMMA and they are super-plastic ,COMMA and so the autists are probably capable of building and learning a symphony which is unthinkable for us .PERIOD 
they choose very carefully who they connect with .PERIOD 
and we did that for tens of thousands of neurons ,COMMA built digital models of all the different types of neurons we came across .PERIOD 
and we think this is species-specific ,COMMA which means that that could explain why we can't communicate across species .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA let's switch it on .PERIOD but to do it ,COMMA what you have to do is you have to make this come alive .PERIOD 
there literally are only a handful of equations that you need to simulate the activity of the neocortex .PERIOD 
here we activate it .PERIOD and this gives the first glimpse of what is happening in your brain when there is a stimulation .PERIOD 
we can ask ,COMMA where is it inside ,COMMA if we stimulate it with a picture ?QUESTIONMARK 
fifty years ago ,COMMA when i began exploring the ocean ,COMMA no one - not jacques perrin ,COMMA not jacques cousteau or rachel carson - imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it or by what we took out of it .PERIOD 
i want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us ,COMMA and to consider why it matters that in <NUM> years ,COMMA we've lost - actually ,COMMA we've taken ,COMMA we've eaten - more than <NUM> percent of the big fish in the sea ;SEMICOLON why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared ;SEMICOLON why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the pacific should concern not only the creatures that are dying ,COMMA but it really should concern you .PERIOD 
i'm haunted by the thought of what ray anderson calls tomorrow's child ,COMMA asking why we didn't do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean while there still was time .PERIOD 
for me ,COMMA as a scientist ,COMMA it all began in <NUM> when i first tried scuba .PERIOD 
since then ,COMMA i've used about <NUM> kinds of submarines and i've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called deep search to design and build systems to access the deep sea .PERIOD 
and i'm living proof .PERIOD 
no matter where on earth you live .PERIOD 
over time ,COMMA most of the planet's organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there ,COMMA mostly by microbes .PERIOD 
you did a great job with the land ,COMMA the dirt .PERIOD 
we need new deep-diving submarines .PERIOD 
that's bad news for us too .PERIOD 
we're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other trash into the sea .PERIOD 
millions of tons of discarded fishing nets ,COMMA gear that continues to kill .PERIOD 
we're still killing bluefin tuna ;SEMICOLON truly endangered and much more valuable alive than dead .PERIOD 
using google earth you can witness trawlers - in china ,COMMA the north sea ,COMMA the gulf of mexico - shaking the foundation of our life support system ,COMMA leaving plumes of death in their path .PERIOD 
together we had just broken the world speed record for a trek to the south pole .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA many of you are probably saying ,COMMA wait a sec ,COMMA is this tough to do ?QUESTIONMARK 
you'll be in a massive headwind .PERIOD 
virtually none .PERIOD all of our equipment ,COMMA including film equipment ,COMMA was charged by the sun .PERIOD 
look at that central building right in the middle of the picture :COLON that's the 130-foot diameter library ,COMMA that is exactly the size of the base of the spaceship .PERIOD 
two days later ,COMMA the space traveler's manifesto explaining why - just like we heard yesterday - why we need to go into space :COLON trips to satellites of the outer planets .PERIOD august <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD 
and that's why when you get something declassified ,COMMA that's what it looks like .PERIOD 
this is ed day putting .PERIOD so each of these coffee cans has three pounds of <NUM> in it .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA thanks to him .PERIOD 
and now we have ground hazard assessments when you have a blow-up on the pad .PERIOD 
this is the kind of stuff that's not been declassified ,COMMA just that people managed to sneak home and after ,COMMA you know ,COMMA on their deathbed basically gave me .PERIOD 
and one part of nasa was interested in it but the headquarters in nasa ,COMMA they killed the project .PERIOD 
so finally at the end ,COMMA we can see the thing followed its sort of design path right up to <NUM> and then all those paths came to a halt .PERIOD 
and it turned out to be quite fun in two ways .PERIOD 
and to the extent you believe i didn't shrink the lines ,COMMA which i didn't ,COMMA i've proven to you that your eyes were deceiving you .PERIOD 
right ?QUESTIONMARK it's impossible to overcome this sense that this is indeed longer .PERIOD 
turns out that they got to <NUM> percent after mailing every household in the country a letter begging people to join this organ donation program .PERIOD 
when you walk into the dmv ,COMMA the person who designed the form will have a huge influence on what you'll end up doing .PERIOD 
what do you do ?QUESTIONMARK do you pull the patient back and try ibuprofen ?QUESTIONMARK 
the other group of the physicians ,COMMA they said ,COMMA yesterday when you reviewed the case you discovered there were two medications you didn't try out yet ,COMMA ibuprofen and piroxicam .PERIOD 
now think of it .PERIOD this decision makes it as easy to let the patient continue with hip replacement .PERIOD 
the thing is is that no physician would ever say ,COMMA piroxicam ,COMMA ibuprofen ,COMMA hip replacement .PERIOD 
an online subscription for <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
these are the market share .PERIOD most people wanted the combo deal .PERIOD 
the answer was absolutely yes .PERIOD 
now you're getting it .PERIOD 
and we also have more than five billion of these devices here .PERIOD 
these <NUM> million cellular radio masts ,COMMA or base stations ,COMMA consume a lot of energy .PERIOD 
and that creates a big problem .PERIOD 
it's good for a nice suntan ,COMMA but otherwise dangerous for the human body .PERIOD 
and multiply that by <NUM> ,COMMA then you end up at <NUM> billion .PERIOD 
not usable for a youtube video .PERIOD 
and the light goes through that hole .PERIOD 
and that signal is then converted back to a high-speed data stream .PERIOD 
and not only integrate a photo detector here ,COMMA but maybe use the camera inside .PERIOD 
so what happens when i switch on that light ?QUESTIONMARK 
but at the same time ,COMMA you see this video coming up here .PERIOD 
so no one ,COMMA if i have a light here ,COMMA if i have secure data ,COMMA no one on the other side of this room through that wall would be able to read that data .PERIOD 
so for me ,COMMA the applications of it ,COMMA to me ,COMMA are beyond imagination at the moment .PERIOD 
and they use light to illuminate space down there .PERIOD 
if you saw <NUM> :COLON a space odyssey ,COMMA and you heard the boom ,COMMA boom ,COMMA boom ,COMMA boom ,COMMA and you saw the monolith ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that was arthur c. clarke's representation that we were at a seminal moment in the evolution of our species .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we in the last <NUM> years in particular have seen this acceleration in knowledge and technology ,COMMA and technology has bred more knowledge and given us tools .PERIOD 
and we've seen many seminal moments .PERIOD 
you're walking around ;SEMICOLON your car has <NUM> microprocessors .PERIOD 
then we go along and create the internet and connect the world together ;SEMICOLON we flatten the world .PERIOD 
the dna is organized in words ,COMMA call them :COLON genes and chromosomes .PERIOD 
dna is a very elegant molecule .PERIOD 
this here is a bug in my genome that i have struggled with for a long ,COMMA long time .PERIOD 
what is the code ?QUESTIONMARK 
then you can go about the process of trying to fix it and figure it out .PERIOD 
for my wife :COLON eat three times as much and you never put on any weight .PERIOD 
it's all hidden in this code ,COMMA and it's starting to be understood at breakneck pace .PERIOD 
we can understand ,COMMA for example ,COMMA why we create plaque in our arteries ,COMMA what creates the starchiness inside of a grain ,COMMA why does yeast metabolize sugar and produce carbon dioxide .PERIOD 
we can also look at ,COMMA at a grander scale ,COMMA what creates problems ,COMMA what creates disease ,COMMA and how we may be able to fix them .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA you have the genome and you say to yourself ,COMMA so ,COMMA if i plug this synthetic genome - if i pull the old one out and plug it in - does it just boot up and live ?QUESTIONMARK 
and this is extremely profound .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA then what do you do ?QUESTIONMARK 
we can start to figure that out .PERIOD 
and he had the best answer i ever heard to this question :COLON well ,COMMA somebody has to .PERIOD 
you cannot compete with the environment ,COMMA if you have an adolescent dog's brain .PERIOD 
go on ,COMMA something should happen now .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA we go ,COMMA puppy ,COMMA sit - boom ,COMMA it's got it in six to <NUM> trials .PERIOD 
he'll find jamie wherever he is ,COMMA you know ,COMMA wherever kids are ,COMMA crushing rocks by a stream or something ,COMMA and take him a little message that says ,COMMA hey ,COMMA dinner's ready .PERIOD come in for dinner .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA at this point ,COMMA the dog knows what we want it to do .PERIOD 
the dog lives with you ,COMMA the dog can get you any time .PERIOD 
so the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want to do what we want him to do ,COMMA and this is very easy .PERIOD 
and what we're doing ,COMMA in essence ,COMMA is we're teaching the dog ,COMMA kind of like - we're letting the dog think that the dog is training us .PERIOD 
and now the dog's really happy .PERIOD 
there's several definitions of what a punishment is ,COMMA but one definition ,COMMA the most popular ,COMMA is :COLON a punishment is a stimulus that reduces the immediately preceding behavior ,COMMA such that it's less likely to occur in the future .PERIOD 
the dog is actually euthanized now ,COMMA but this was a dog i worked with for a while .PERIOD 
when the dog would try to leave the mat ,COMMA she would say ,COMMA rover ,COMMA on the mat ,COMMA on the mat ,COMMA on the mat .PERIOD 
how are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear ?QUESTIONMARK 
rover ,COMMA come here .PERIOD rover ,COMMA come here ,COMMA you son of a bitch .PERIOD 
and i went ,COMMA oh my god ,COMMA do i do something ?QUESTIONMARK 
the husband won't clear up his clothes ,COMMA or the wife's always late for meetings ,COMMA whatever it is ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
you see it especially in the workplace ,COMMA especially from boss to employee .PERIOD 
and this ,COMMA i would say ,COMMA is the biggest human foible that we have .PERIOD 
your kids are easy to train .PERIOD 
we think how we do it - one night in bed ,COMMA we're pregnant ,COMMA and then we're raising the most important thing in life ,COMMA a child .PERIOD 
and it concludes in something that you see here ,COMMA that you actually wouldn't expect as being the result of rationality .PERIOD 
i call it sort of shotgun flexibility .PERIOD 
so what you're seeing now is actually the design of the building .PERIOD 
so that was the core idea .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA once we had presented that back to them ,COMMA they agreed that this sort of core concept could work .PERIOD 
the things on the - on the left-hand side of the diagram ,COMMA those are the boxes .PERIOD 
that skin serves double duty ,COMMA again for economics .PERIOD 
so it's an unusual building for a public library ,COMMA obviously .PERIOD 
that was the main sort of technology area in the building .PERIOD 
you dizzy yet ?QUESTIONMARK 
and it allowed us to go back to first principles ,COMMA and redefine fly tower ,COMMA acoustic enclosure ,COMMA light enclosure and so forth .PERIOD 
they came to us and they said - unlike normal developers - they said ,COMMA we want to start out by providing a contemporary art museum in louisville .PERIOD that's our main goal .PERIOD 
and so instead of being a developer that sees an opportunity to make money ,COMMA they saw an ability to be a catalyst in their downtown .PERIOD 
and that pro forma led us to a mixed-use building that was very large in order to support their aspirations of the art ,COMMA but it also opened up opportunities for the art itself to collaborate ,COMMA interact with commercial spaces that actually artists more and more want to work within .PERIOD 
and there is a pedestrian corridor that they wanted to add that would link a series of cultural buildings ,COMMA and a view corridor - because this is the historic district - that they didn't want to obstruct with the new building .PERIOD 
it also means that if an artist wants to invade something like a swimming pool ,COMMA they can begin to do their exhibition in a swimming pool ,COMMA so they're not forced to always work within the confines of a contemporary gallery space .PERIOD 
ok. now ,COMMA you're <NUM> now ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i tried ,COMMA and i made it .PERIOD 
and you made it out of what ?QUESTIONMARK 
and so ,COMMA and that windmill ,COMMA what - it worked ?QUESTIONMARK 
yeah .PERIOD 
so what did they make of - that you were <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> at the time - what did they make of this ?QUESTIONMARK they were impressed ?QUESTIONMARK 
yeah .PERIOD 
so that would produce irrigation for the entire village ?QUESTIONMARK 
because it gets into all sorts of crazy realms .PERIOD 
♫ this is a loop ,COMMA feedback loop ♫ ♫ this is a loop ,COMMA feedback loop ♫ ♫ this is a loop ,COMMA feedback loop ♫ ♫ this is a loop ,COMMA feedback loop ♫ ♫ this is a loop ,COMMA feedback loop ♫ ♫ this is a loop ,COMMA feedback loop ♫ ♫ this is a - all right .PERIOD i don't know if that was necessary to demonstrate - - but my point is it's the sound of self-destruction .PERIOD 
there seems to be a rule in nature that if you get too close to where you came from ,COMMA it gets ugly .PERIOD 
the oil was running out ,COMMA and a nuclear winter would finish us off .PERIOD 
it just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand .PERIOD 
homo erectus made the same tool for <NUM> generations .PERIOD 
of course there were a few changes ,COMMA but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days .PERIOD 
it's an extraordinary phenomenon ,COMMA but it's true .PERIOD 
and more than that ,COMMA it's a confection of different ideas ,COMMA the idea of plastic ,COMMA the idea of a laser ,COMMA the idea of transistors .PERIOD 
one goes extinct for the other to survive .PERIOD 
so what sex does is it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species .PERIOD 
so oz is better at both spears and axes than adam .PERIOD 
ask yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by .PERIOD 
and that's seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you've gained since <NUM> ,COMMA as it were ,COMMA because that's seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else ,COMMA or you can acquire another good or service .PERIOD 
they were a highly intelligent species .PERIOD 
the reason :COLON because tierra del fuego is separated from south america by a much narrower straight ,COMMA and there was trading contact across that straight throughout <NUM> years .PERIOD 
the tasmanians were isolated .PERIOD 
it's not the same with language .PERIOD 
with language we have to transfer ideas that we understand with each other .PERIOD 
there will be wars ;SEMICOLON there will be depressions ;SEMICOLON there will be natural disasters .PERIOD 
my work is about the behaviors that we all engage in unconsciously ,COMMA on a collective level .PERIOD 
and as individuals ,COMMA we all do these things ,COMMA all the time ,COMMA everyday .PERIOD 
it's like when you're mean to your wife because you're mad at somebody else .PERIOD 
or when you overeat because your feelings are hurt ,COMMA or whatever .PERIOD 
that's <NUM> minutes of our cup consumption .PERIOD 
and if you could actually stack up that many cups in real life ,COMMA that's the size it would be .PERIOD 
i wanted to make a piece that shows the actual number of americans who die from cigarette smoking .PERIOD 
and we aren't talking about it - we dismiss it .PERIOD 
and strangely enough ,COMMA the only plastic surgery that is more popular than breast augmentation is liposuction ,COMMA and most of that is being done by men .PERIOD 
my belief is that you don't have to make yourself bad to look at these issues .PERIOD 
how can we investigate this flora of viruses that surround us ,COMMA and aid medicine ?QUESTIONMARK 
but evolution is a balance :COLON where you have fast change ,COMMA you also have ultra-conservation - things that almost never change .PERIOD 
and so we looked into this a little more carefully ,COMMA and i'm going to show you data now .PERIOD 
down here you can see slower evolution :COLON less diversity .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA so that's what we did ,COMMA but how are we going to do that ?QUESTIONMARK 
if you've got enough money to buy just a camry ,COMMA you can build one of these too ,COMMA and so we put a deep how-to guide on the web ,COMMA totally free ,COMMA with basically order-off-the-shelf parts .PERIOD 
and so what we did - and this is a really cool project - we just started by making a respiratory virus chip .PERIOD 
that's the scourge of daycare centers everywhere - it's like boogeremia ,COMMA basically .PERIOD 
and so it is not any one stripe or something that tells me i have a virus of a particular type here ;SEMICOLON it's the barcode that in bulk represents the whole thing .PERIOD 
that's me ,COMMA getting a nasal lavage .PERIOD 
actually ,COMMA we thought the nasal tract might be full of viruses even when you're walking around healthy .PERIOD 
so that's great ,COMMA but again ,COMMA cheap shot ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA we built out the chip .PERIOD 
now we're using this chip .PERIOD and what are we using it for ?QUESTIONMARK 
and this is what this looks like .PERIOD 
and that is ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA what these particular cell cultures are chronically infected with .PERIOD 
so let's do something a little bit harder .PERIOD 
they did a ct scan .PERIOD 
switch antibiotics :COLON so they switched to another antibiotic ,COMMA tamiflu .PERIOD 
there's almost no epidemiology or studies on it .PERIOD 
and why is that ?QUESTIONMARK just lore .PERIOD there's no data - no data to support whether it causes severe or mild disease .PERIOD 
it doesn't make sense - unless ,COMMA maybe ,COMMA there's a virus ?QUESTIONMARK 
and this is a little phylogenetic tree to see how it's related to other viruses .PERIOD 
is it the case that these guys are just more susceptible to viruses ?QUESTIONMARK 
this was all done by folks in the lab - i cannot take credit for most of this .PERIOD 
i'm talking about the production of aluminum .PERIOD 
the electrolyte is not a solution of salt and water ,COMMA but rather salt that's melted .PERIOD 
so now ,COMMA how to choose the metals ?QUESTIONMARK 
i felt the thrill of realization when i knew i'd come upon the answer .PERIOD 
it's pretty cool ,COMMA at least in theory .PERIOD 
we go to the laboratory .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA i hire a student and mentor him ,COMMA teach him how to think about the problem ,COMMA to see it from my perspective and then turn him loose .PERIOD 
and i was able to attract really ,COMMA really good people ,COMMA people who share my passion for science and service to society ,COMMA not science and service for career building .PERIOD 
i went to aspen recently and stumbled into this song .PERIOD 
♫ black men go to aspen ♫ ♫ and rent colorful chalets .PERIOD ♫ ♫ giggle at the questions ♫ ♫ their mere presence seems to raise .PERIOD ♫ ♫ get taken for men ♫ ♫ we don't resemble in the least .PERIOD ♫ are you .PERIOD ?QUESTIONMARK 
and since they discovered those things ,COMMA it really stuck with them so much more ,COMMA and also they would experience their own failures ;SEMICOLON there was a failure-based aspect to learning there .PERIOD it was very important .PERIOD 
and another thing that really impressed me a long time ago was powers of ten ,COMMA charles and ray eames' film .PERIOD 
and so i'm going to show you a toy today that i've been working on ,COMMA that i think of more than anything else as kind of a philosophy toy .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA we actually play through many generations here ,COMMA at the cellular scale .PERIOD 
but basically ,COMMA this is the editor where we're going to design the next generation of our creature .PERIOD so it has a little spine .PERIOD 
but really the goal here was ,COMMA within about a minute ,COMMA i wanted somebody to replicate what typically takes a pictorial artist several weeks to create .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA now i'll put some hands on it .PERIOD 
and i can see how it might dance .PERIOD 
i can also play with the dynamics of this world over time .PERIOD 
and our cities are going to be at risk too ,COMMA because a lot of these are coastal cities .PERIOD 
here it is ,COMMA some indigenous life down here .PERIOD 
you see ,COMMA now they've actually gone to tribal dynamics .PERIOD 
i think i'll leave before they get hostile .PERIOD 
but these are the things that we can kind of put in this little galaxy here .PERIOD 
because i think most of the problems that our world is facing right now is the result of short-term thinking ,COMMA and the fact that it is so hard for us to think <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA or <NUM> years out .PERIOD 
and so i'm going to talk a little bit about that ,COMMA keeping in mind that we have a lot on the program here .PERIOD 
what's in it for the ant ?QUESTIONMARK 
no ,COMMA it's worse than that .PERIOD 
there are a lot of ideas to die for .PERIOD 
the secret of happiness is :COLON find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it .PERIOD 
actually ,COMMA i think we're all responsible for not just the intended effects of our ideas ,COMMA but for their likely misuses .PERIOD 
so let me just point out :COLON memes are like viruses .PERIOD 
and you might think ,COMMA well ,COMMA how can that be ?QUESTIONMARK 
they're made of information ,COMMA and can be carried in any physical medium .PERIOD 
not just the priests .PERIOD everybody .PERIOD 
after all ,COMMA the meme for shaker-dom was essentially a sterilizing parasite .PERIOD 
but among all those ideas that inevitably flow out into the whole world thanks to our technology ,COMMA are a lot of toxic ideas .PERIOD 
and it's not our fault ,COMMA anymore than it's our fault when our germs lay waste to people that haven't developed the immunity .PERIOD 
we drove to the goodwill and we threw the sweater away somewhat ceremoniously ,COMMA my idea being that i would never have to think about the sweater nor see it ever again .PERIOD 
i tell that story ,COMMA because it has served and continues to serve as a metaphor to me about the level of connectedness that we all have on this earth .PERIOD 
it's thrilling .PERIOD 
first ,COMMA she talked about comfort ,COMMA status ,COMMA beauty .PERIOD 
and we've started making curtains ,COMMA and not only is it beautiful ,COMMA but people can see status - that you care about your children .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
my job depends upon it .PERIOD 
up to and around about the second world war ,COMMA conductors were invariably dictators - these tyrannical figures who would rehearse ,COMMA not just the orchestra as a whole ,COMMA but individuals within it ,COMMA within an inch of their lives .PERIOD 
let's be under no illusions .PERIOD 
simply through singing .PERIOD 
so we got some shows off the ground .PERIOD we started touring them internationally .PERIOD 
one of them was carmen .PERIOD 
i want to play you a tiny clip of it now for no other reason than to give you proof positive that there is nothing tiny about south african music making .PERIOD 
they don't read music .PERIOD 
and yet ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA every single one of us on this planet probably engages with music on a daily basis .PERIOD 
i've got a little experiment i want to try with you .PERIOD 
t ,COMMA see it's the same as f in music .PERIOD 
there i am like a bloody windmill again ,COMMA you see .PERIOD 
the music will start ,COMMA and then at a signal from me ,COMMA you will sing that .PERIOD 
one more time ,COMMA with feeling ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen .PERIOD 
it's going to be britain's first ever national disabled orchestra .PERIOD 
clarence :COLON i would rather be able to play an instrument again than walk .PERIOD 
i only wish that some of those musicians were here with us today ,COMMA so you could see at firsthand how utterly extraordinary they are .PERIOD 
if any of you thinks you want to help me in any way to achieve what is a fairly impossible and implausible dream still at this point ,COMMA please let me know .PERIOD 
haydn remonstrated with the prince ,COMMA but to no avail .PERIOD 
♫ like the heather ♫ ♫ on the hillside ♫ ♫ as they drove us ♫ ♫ from the highlands ♫ ♫ like the ice flow ♫ ♫ from the arctic ♫ ♫ where we landed ♫ ♫ in newfoundland ♫ ♫ there's a color ♫ ♫ to my sorrow ♫ ♫ there's a name for ♫ ♫ all this sadness ♫ ♫ like the ocean ♫ ♫ in between us ♫ ♫ i am blue ♫ ♫ blue is a river ♫ ♫ blue remembered ♫ ♫ blue water ♫ ♫ running clear ♫ ♫ blue like a planet ♫ ♫ to a spaceman ♫ ♫ blue river ♫ ♫ of my tears ♫ ♫ so i came here ♫ ♫ to the city ♫ ♫ where the dream burns ♫ ♫ like a furnace ♫ ♫ and i dazzled ♫ ♫ in these dark streets ♫ ♫ like a diamond ♫ ♫ in a coalface ♫ ♫ then the cold wind ♫ ♫ from the islands ♫ ♫ blew a storm cloud ♫ ♫ across the new moon ♫ ♫ like the gun smoke ♫ ♫ above the houses ♫ ♫ in my home ♫ ♫ blue is a river ♫ ♫ blue remembered ♫ ♫ blue water ♫ ♫ running clear ♫ ♫ blue like a planet ♫ ♫ to a spaceman ♫ ♫ blue river ♫ ♫ of my tears ♫ ♫ blue river ♫ ♫ of my tears ♫ well ,COMMA the subject of difficult negotiation reminds me of one of my favorite stories from the middle east ,COMMA of a man who left to his three sons <NUM> camels .PERIOD 
seventeen doesn't divide by two .PERIOD 
the wise old woman thought about their problem for a long time ,COMMA and finally she came back and said ,COMMA well ,COMMA i don't know if i can help you ,COMMA but at least ,COMMA if you want ,COMMA you can have my camel .PERIOD 
they had one camel left over .PERIOD 
now if you think about that story for a moment ,COMMA i think it resembles a lot of the difficult negotiations we get involved in .PERIOD 
as i've spent the last better part of three decades ,COMMA almost four ,COMMA traveling the world ,COMMA trying to work ,COMMA getting involved in conflicts ranging from yugoslavia to the middle east to chechnya to venezuela ,COMMA some of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet ,COMMA i've been asking myself that question .PERIOD 
so how do they deal with their differences ?QUESTIONMARK 
but what we don't often see is that there's always a third side ,COMMA and the third side of the conflict is us ,COMMA it's the surrounding community ,COMMA it's the friends ,COMMA the allies ,COMMA the family members ,COMMA the neighbors .PERIOD 
perhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help is to remind the parties of what's really at stake .PERIOD 
and we met in the hague ,COMMA in the peace palace ,COMMA in the same room where the yugoslav war crimes tribunal was taking place .PERIOD 
and then he went on ,COMMA and then he turned to me and said ,COMMA you're an american .PERIOD 
now i don't pretend to have an answer to the middle east conflict ,COMMA but i think i've got a first step ,COMMA literally ,COMMA a first step ,COMMA something that any one of us could do as third-siders .PERIOD 
and so my question is ,COMMA yes ,COMMA let's try and resolve the politics there in the middle east ,COMMA but let's also take a look at the story .PERIOD 
let's see if we can apply the third side to it .PERIOD 
what would that mean ?QUESTIONMARK what is the story there ?QUESTIONMARK 
now as anthropologists ,COMMA we know that every culture has an origin story .PERIOD 
that man ,COMMA of course ,COMMA was abraham .PERIOD 
what's the opposite of terrorism ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's taking an innocent stranger and treating them as a friend whom you welcome into your home in order to sow and create understanding ,COMMA or respect ,COMMA or love .PERIOD 
and that's what comes to the first step here .PERIOD 
that's the essence of the abraham path .PERIOD 
so what we discovered is that abraham is not just a figure out of a book for those people .PERIOD 
and just a couple weeks ago ,COMMA there was an npr story on it .PERIOD 
and they quoted a villager who said ,COMMA this walk connects us to the world .PERIOD 
she's partially blind ,COMMA her husband can't work ,COMMA she's got seven kids .PERIOD 
and so more and more walkers have come ,COMMA and lately she's begun to earn an income to support her family .PERIOD 
so my question is ,COMMA if it can be done in europe ,COMMA why not in the middle east ?QUESTIONMARK 
that's walking abraham's path .PERIOD 
after a tedtalk ,COMMA why not a tedwalk ?QUESTIONMARK 
there's an old african proverb that goes :COLON when spider webs unite ,COMMA they can halt even the lion .PERIOD 
if we're able to unite our third-side webs of peace ,COMMA we can even halt the lion of war .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA what is needed for the earliest possible warning of a heart attack ?QUESTIONMARK 
a means to determine if there's a complete blockage of a coronary artery .PERIOD 
and if we had a computer put into the body of a person who's at risk ,COMMA we could know ,COMMA before they even have symptoms ,COMMA that they're having a heart attack ,COMMA to save their life .PERIOD 
and what we tried with the pig was external electrodes on the skin ,COMMA like you see in an emergency room ,COMMA and i'm going to show you why they don't work very well .PERIOD 
next to it ,COMMA at <NUM> seconds ,COMMA you see this rise here ,COMMA then this rise - that's the st elevation .PERIOD 
then ,COMMA on friday at <NUM> ,COMMA he began to get certain signs ,COMMA which later we had the pig run around - i'm not going to go into this early stage .PERIOD 
finally ,COMMA if you're lucky ,COMMA you are treated in three or four hours after the incident ,COMMA but the heart muscle has died .PERIOD 
and now i want to talk about something entirely different .PERIOD 
so here's a picture of what we're doing .PERIOD 
there's this migraine that is preceded by a visual aura ,COMMA and this visual aura ,COMMA by the way - and i'll show you a picture - but it sort of begins with little dancing lights ,COMMA gets bigger and bigger until it fills your whole visual field .PERIOD 
christina sidebottom :COLON well ,COMMA my first reaction was that it was - looked awfully gun-like ,COMMA and it was very strange .PERIOD 
the most severe headaches responded better after we did it several times ,COMMA and the unexpected finding indicates that even established headaches ,COMMA not only those with aura ,COMMA get treated and get diminished .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA responsive electrical stimulation means that we sense ,COMMA at a place in your brain which is called an epileptic focus ,COMMA which is where the epileptic seizure begins - we sense there ,COMMA that it's going to happen ,COMMA and then we respond by applying an electrical energy at that spot ,COMMA which erases the errant signal so that you don't get the clinical manifestations of the migraine headache .PERIOD 
that concludes my discussion of epilepsy ,COMMA which is the third invention that i want to discuss here this afternoon .PERIOD 
we want to have some people ,COMMA who really know how to do this ,COMMA perform human engineering studies to develop the optimum design for the portable device for treating migraine headaches .PERIOD 
and that is the second wish .PERIOD 
we needed to take what we had built and create a platform out of it so that it could be used elsewhere in the world .PERIOD 
and so there is a team of developers from all over africa ,COMMA who are part of this team now - from ghana ,COMMA from malawi ,COMMA from kenya .PERIOD 
what is the veracity level of what you're looking at ?QUESTIONMARK 
so you've got a lot of information .PERIOD that's great .PERIOD 
take the crowd and apply them to the information .PERIOD 
and we are very happy to be part of the ted family .PERIOD 
it's inevitable ,COMMA terrible ,COMMA but really what i want to talk about is ,COMMA i'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die .PERIOD 
a value for things with a personal touch - an autograph book ,COMMA a soul-searching letter .PERIOD 
if a fraction of this powerful ted audience could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper - john ,COMMA it'll be a recycled one - and write a beautiful letter to someone they love ,COMMA we actually may start a revolution where our children may go to penmanship classes .PERIOD 
so what do i plan to leave for my son ?QUESTIONMARK 
i plan to publish my own notebook .PERIOD 
i have no idea how i'm going to do it ,COMMA but i am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine into a book ,COMMA and leave that published book for my son .PERIOD 
what's happened in the music world is there's a culture or an ecosystem that's been created that ,COMMA if you take some words from apple ,COMMA the catchphrase that we create ,COMMA rip ,COMMA mix and burn .PERIOD 
and what that's done is it's created ,COMMA like i said ,COMMA a vibrant community that's very inclusive with people continually working to connect musical ideas ,COMMA innovate them and keep things constantly up to date .PERIOD 
imagine making it free ,COMMA so that anyone in the world can have access to all of this knowledge ,COMMA and imagine using information technology so that you can update this content ,COMMA improve it ,COMMA play with it ,COMMA on a timescale that's more on the order of seconds instead of years .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA a lot of this use coming from unites states ,COMMA k-through-12 schools because anyone who's involved in a school scale back ,COMMA the first thing that's cut is the music curriculum and so this is just indicating the tremendous thirst for this kind of open ,COMMA free content .PERIOD 
we've been working with amd ,COMMA which has a project called <NUM> by <NUM> ,COMMA which is trying to bring internet connectivity to <NUM> percent of the world's population by <NUM> .PERIOD 
in particular ,COMMA a bunch of the projects that are funded by hewlett foundation ,COMMA who have taken a real leadership role in this area of open content .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA burn ,COMMA i think this is sort of ,COMMA quite interesting .PERIOD 
how much would it cost in a bookstore ?QUESTIONMARK 
why does it cost <NUM> dollars ?QUESTIONMARK 
remember we took the book ,COMMA tore the pages out ?QUESTIONMARK 
imagine music xml that actually lets you delve into the semantic structure of music ,COMMA play with it ,COMMA understand it .PERIOD 
even the three wise men .PERIOD 
because we're saying that anybody can contribute things to this commons .PERIOD anybody can contribute anything .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA thanks very much .PERIOD 
i've been at mit for <NUM> years .PERIOD i went to ted i .PERIOD 
everybody agrees that whatever the solutions are to the big problems ,COMMA they include education ,COMMA sometimes can be just education ,COMMA and can never be without some element of education .PERIOD 
so with those as the principles - some of you may know seymour papert ;SEMICOLON this is back in <NUM> ,COMMA when we were working in senegal .PERIOD 
here we're in the <NUM> .PERIOD 
and these kids ,COMMA their first english word is google ,COMMA and they only know skype .PERIOD they've never heard of telephony .PERIOD 
screw you .PERIOD go to the back of the line and someone else will do it ,COMMA and then when you figure out that this works ,COMMA you can join as well .PERIOD 
and the idea is to launch with enough scale that the scale itself helps bring the price down ,COMMA and that's why i said seven to <NUM> million there .PERIOD 
now once people start looking at this ,COMMA they say ,COMMA ah ,COMMA this is a laptop project .PERIOD 
because laptop economics are the following :COLON i say <NUM> percent here ;SEMICOLON it's more like <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> percent of the cost of your laptop is sales ,COMMA marketing ,COMMA distribution and profit .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA i've been using laptops since their inception .PERIOD 
the dual mode display - the idea is to have a display that both works outdoors - isn't it fun using your cell phone outdoors in the sunlight ?QUESTIONMARK 
and in about <NUM> days we'll know for sure whether this works .PERIOD 
probably the most important piece there is that the kids really can do the maintenance .PERIOD 
so this is just a mechanical engineering sort of embodiment of it for you to play with .PERIOD 
everybody thinks they know about education ,COMMA a lot of culture is built into it as well .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA guess what ,COMMA we're not .PERIOD 
because there's no market for post office trucks .PERIOD 
you can spray paint it ;SEMICOLON you can do anything you want .PERIOD 
that came from a <NUM> paper on space travel ,COMMA because ,COMMA if you think about it ,COMMA space is pretty awkward .PERIOD 
he said ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no .PERIOD here's a better way .PERIOD 
and he said ,COMMA well ,COMMA okay .PERIOD 
and if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone ,COMMA the room would be very crowded .PERIOD 
these are the people that you have access to right now ,COMMA in general - all of these people ,COMMA all of your friends and family that you can connect to .PERIOD 
but when you actually visualize it ,COMMA all the connections that we're doing right now - this is an image of the mapping of the internet - it doesn't look technological .PERIOD 
it actually looks very organic .PERIOD 
it's that they're helping us to be more human ,COMMA helping us to connect with each other .PERIOD 
we're just increasing our humanness and our ability to connect with each other ,COMMA regardless of geography .PERIOD 
so that's why i study cyborg anthropology .PERIOD 
and people are initially reluctant to tell you .PERIOD 
we talk about things in relative terms .PERIOD 
and so when we look at these pmtct programs ,COMMA what does it mean ?QUESTIONMARK 
imagine yourself ,COMMA if you can ,COMMA you're a young woman in africa ,COMMA you're going to the hospital or clinic .PERIOD 
and you don't know who you can talk to ,COMMA because the truth is ,COMMA hiv is so stigmatizing that if you partner ,COMMA your family ,COMMA anyone in your home ,COMMA you're likely to be thrown out without any means of support .PERIOD 
and this - this is the face and story of hiv in africa today .PERIOD 
but we're here to talk about possible solutions and some good news .PERIOD 
our organization ,COMMA mothers2mothers ,COMMA enlists women with hiv as care providers .PERIOD 
but if you wanted to understand what that surgery would do to your life ,COMMA you'd like to engage someone ,COMMA someone who's had the procedure .PERIOD 
and so doctors and nurses - they look up to them as experts .PERIOD 
men are not frequently part of pregnancy care .PERIOD 
and this is so important in breaking through the stigma .PERIOD 
and if we can change enough communities ,COMMA we can change national attitudes .PERIOD 
we have the medicines ,COMMA we have the tests ,COMMA but how do you reduce the stigma ?QUESTIONMARK 
i've been afraid to tell everybody .PERIOD 
how do you build a better health care system ?QUESTIONMARK 
and our organization helps women across that bridge .PERIOD 
the program is now working in nine countries ,COMMA we have <NUM> program sites ,COMMA we're seeing about <NUM> women every month ,COMMA we're employing <NUM> mentor mothers ,COMMA and last year ,COMMA they enrolled <NUM> hiv-positive pregnant women and mothers .PERIOD 
all of this is possible ,COMMA if we each contribute to this fight .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
then they irradiate our food ,COMMA trying to make it last longer ,COMMA so it can travel thousands of miles from where it's grown to the supermarkets .PERIOD 
this man ,COMMA joel salatin ,COMMA they call him a lunatic farmer because he grows against the system .PERIOD 
since i'm home-schooled ,COMMA i went to go hear him speak one day .PERIOD 
i want you to know that there are farmers' markets in every community popping up .PERIOD 
not too long ago ,COMMA my uncle said that he offered my six-year-old cousin cereal .PERIOD 
now we had a harvard professor here - she was from harvard ,COMMA i just wanted to mention and - and she was actually a professor from harvard .PERIOD 
the scales here are religiosity from zero percent ,COMMA or atheist ,COMMA to <NUM> percent ,COMMA bible literally true .PERIOD 
now let's talk about some of the characteristics that are important for this revolutionary device .PERIOD 
first of all ,COMMA it needs to be small .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i bought this device from clifford stoll for about <NUM> bucks .PERIOD 
free bird .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA one more time - i'm just going to give you a little help .PERIOD 
and finally ,COMMA we're going to put the marriott hotel and the portola plaza on the top .PERIOD 
mr. vice president ,COMMA i wish i knew how to quit you .PERIOD 
and sylvia earle and i were on an expedition in this submarine <NUM> years ago in japan .PERIOD 
but when i got there ,COMMA i found lots of plastic garbage and other debris .PERIOD 
it's in the mid-pacific .PERIOD it's about five days from anywhere .PERIOD 
so that's when i first learned of the islands and had no idea what i was getting into .PERIOD 
it's a very deep-water part of our planet .PERIOD 
but we got up there ,COMMA and i had the unique and wonderful scientific opportunity and personal opportunity to get to a place that had never been dived and just get to an island and go ,COMMA okay ,COMMA where are we going to dive ?QUESTIONMARK 
let's try there ,COMMA and then falling into the water .PERIOD 
the phoenix islands and all the equatorial parts of our planet are very important for tuna fisheries ,COMMA especially this yellowfin tuna that you see here .PERIOD 
so i thought the scenes of never-ending wilderness would go on forever ,COMMA but they did finally come to an end .PERIOD 
they basically are one nation that controls most of the equatorial waters of the central pacific ocean .PERIOD 
and for some reason they didn't want me to come ,COMMA or it was hard to find a time and a place ,COMMA and it took a while ,COMMA but finally they said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA you can come .PERIOD 
and i was free for dinner ,COMMA and i went out to dinner with the minister of fisheries in kiribati .PERIOD 
it had occurred on land ,COMMA in rainforests of south america and africa ,COMMA where landowners had been paid not to cut the trees down .PERIOD 
so we had very strong leadership ,COMMA very good vision and a lot of science ,COMMA a lot of lawyers involved .PERIOD 
so suddenly we had this area that we were protecting ,COMMA but now it appeared to be dead ,COMMA at least in the coral areas .PERIOD 
and that's the story with climate-change heating .PERIOD 
and we are now in the process of raising the full endowment .PERIOD 
and i actually went to see some of the design companies in hong kong in my stay there .PERIOD 
and i'll just give you one example .PERIOD i had gotten my first walkman .PERIOD 
last november ,COMMA a museum opened in tokyo called the mori museum ,COMMA in a skyscraper ,COMMA up on the <NUM> floor .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA for sure ,COMMA i haven't looked at the sky in the same way after spending an hour in there .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA one is :COLON just working without pressure .PERIOD 
this is ,COMMA you know ,COMMA related to it :COLON getting out of the studio .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA we could supply the content for it .PERIOD 
icons like batman ,COMMA superman ,COMMA wonder woman and their colleagues will be teaming up with icons jabbar ,COMMA noora ,COMMA jami and their colleagues .PERIOD 
as christian iconography got changed ,COMMA and swastikas were created out of crucifixes ,COMMA batman and superman were created by jewish young men in the united states and canada ,COMMA also going back to the bible .PERIOD 
superman is not only sent to earth from the heavens ,COMMA or krypton ,COMMA but he's sent in a pod ,COMMA much like moses was on the nile .PERIOD 
so <NUM> of the stones are smuggled onto the nina ,COMMA the pinta and the santa maria and are spread in the new world .PERIOD 
to which he said ,COMMA let them be ,COMMA because what they're giving us is worth a lot more than what we're paying them .PERIOD 
so these <NUM> stones ,COMMA a few kind of rules in the game :COLON number one ,COMMA you don't choose the stone ;SEMICOLON the stone chooses you .PERIOD 
well .PERIOD 
we have jabbar from saudi who starts breaking things when he has the power .PERIOD 
i'm like ,COMMA are all the girls going to be kind and merciful and the guys all strong ?QUESTIONMARK 
that's not timely .PERIOD 
and that led to all kinds of things ,COMMA from being in curricula in universities and schools to - one of my favorite pictures i have from south asia ,COMMA it was a couple of men with long beards and a lot of girls wearing the hijab - it looked like a school .PERIOD 
opened a theme park through a license in kuwait a year and a half ago called the <NUM> village theme park - <NUM> square feet ,COMMA <NUM> rides ,COMMA all with our characters :COLON a couple back-to-school licenses in spain and turkey .PERIOD 
rughal :COLON there must be something we can do .PERIOD

you are noora the light .PERIOD 
i don't deserve it .PERIOD i don't deserve anything .PERIOD 
jabbar :COLON we're here to help you .PERIOD 
as the father of five sons ,COMMA i worry about who they're going to be using as role models .PERIOD 
and torture's a terrible enough thing as it is ,COMMA but when it's done by your hero ,COMMA that just breaks you in so many ways .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA one of the things that i refer to when i - about the importance of this message - is that i gave a lecture at the medical school at kuwait university ,COMMA where i lecture on the biological basis of behavior ,COMMA and i gave the students two articles ,COMMA one from the new york times and one from new york magazine .PERIOD 
any boys and girls caught flirting would get married off immediately ,COMMA okay .PERIOD 
the second one took place in upstate new york .PERIOD 
she was actually coming out of an amnesty international meeting .PERIOD 
and the good news is there might be an easy solution to that ,COMMA and that's using our eyes more .PERIOD 
and it mushroomed slightly .PERIOD afghanistan and iraq mushroomed now to <NUM> billion .PERIOD 
so there it is :COLON <NUM> billion is what africa owes .PERIOD 
and the recent financial crisis ,COMMA how much of this diagram might that figure take up ?QUESTIONMARK 
we need to imagine what a landscape of the world's fears might look like .PERIOD 
this is mountains out of molehills ,COMMA a timeline of global media panic .PERIOD 
and there's a very interesting and odd pattern hidden in this data that you can only see when you visualize it .PERIOD 
let me show you this .PERIOD 
i'll take answers .PERIOD 
i wonder if i could make my life beautiful .PERIOD 
it's the language of the eye .PERIOD 
but of course ,COMMA china has an enormous population .PERIOD 
and if it can do that ,COMMA maybe it can also change your behavior .PERIOD 
but what it points to is that visualizing information like this is a form of knowledge compression .PERIOD 
so heart is filtered out ,COMMA so i can see if i'm curious about that .PERIOD 
so the data is now alive ;SEMICOLON this is a living image ,COMMA and i can update it in a second .PERIOD 
it's even fun to engage with them because it's visual .PERIOD 
and that is beautiful .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD 
i will show it to you .PERIOD 
the top note that you smelled at the very beginning ,COMMA the cut-grass green ,COMMA what we call in perfumery - they ’ re weird terms - and this would be called a green note ,COMMA because it smells of something green ,COMMA like cut grass .PERIOD 
this is cis-3-hexene-1-ol .PERIOD and i had to learn chemistry on the fly in the last three years .PERIOD a very expensive high school chemistry education .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA this is a totally insane idea .PERIOD 
and my definition of a theory is ,COMMA it ’ s not just something that you teach people ;SEMICOLON it ’ s labor saving .PERIOD 
if it does ,COMMA you put the glass down ,COMMA you go to a different bar .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i showed this to a physicist friend of mine who has a profound distaste for biology ,COMMA and he says ,COMMA that ’ s easy !EXCLAMATIONMARK the things are a different color !EXCLAMATIONMARK

and it ’ s fair to say that if you look up somebody ’ s nose ,COMMA you ’ re unlikely to see anything resembling this .PERIOD 
ok. now .PERIOD if something absorbs the energy ,COMMA the electron can travel .PERIOD 
what ’ s nice about this idea ,COMMA if you have a philosophical bent of mind ,COMMA is that then it tells you that the nose ,COMMA the ear and the eye are all vibrational senses .PERIOD 
he says to me ,COMMA i bet you cannot make a coumarin .PERIOD

but also ,COMMA surprising finds recently announced from the island of flores in indonesia ,COMMA where a group of these human ancestors have been isolated ,COMMA and have become dwarfed ,COMMA and they're only about a meter in height .PERIOD 
and what is it that really makes us us ?QUESTIONMARK 
i think it's our collective intelligence .PERIOD 
i had saved a few hundred photos of dodo skeletons into my creative projects folder - it's a repository for my brain ,COMMA everything that i could possibly be interested in .PERIOD 
assuming it was roughly the size of my wife's hand ,COMMA i made some measurements of her thumb ,COMMA and i scaled them out to the size of the skull .PERIOD 
built out of words ,COMMA it is the engine that drives the plot of his book and also the movie ,COMMA in which another object is created :COLON a prop that has to represent the thing that hammett created out of words ,COMMA inspired by the kniphausen hawk ,COMMA and this represents the falcon in the movie .PERIOD 
and so now it was time to do some research .PERIOD 
what do they do ,COMMA how do you start something like that ?QUESTIONMARK i really don't know .PERIOD 
and i'm following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that as i'm holding the light in the same position ,COMMA i'm getting the same type of reflection on it - that's the level of detail i'm going into this thing .PERIOD 
this thing was made of resin and it was too light .PERIOD 
that's half the weight of my dog ,COMMA huxley .PERIOD 
on the far left is a piece of crap - a replica i bought on ebay .PERIOD 
so what do i do ?QUESTIONMARK i figure i have two options .PERIOD 
one ,COMMA i can fire a freaking laser at it ,COMMA which i have already done ,COMMA to do a <NUM> scan - there's a <NUM> scan of this falcon .PERIOD 
but really ,COMMA if we're all going to be honest with ourselves ,COMMA i have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise was never the point of the exercise to begin with ,COMMA was it .PERIOD 
it was actually developed for use by the offshore oil industry for diving on oil rigs down to a depth of <NUM> feet .PERIOD 
if i go out in the open ocean environment ,COMMA virtually anywhere in the world ,COMMA and i drag a net from <NUM> feet to the surface ,COMMA most of the animals - in fact ,COMMA in many places ,COMMA <NUM> to <NUM> percent of the animals that i bring up in that net - make light .PERIOD 
so you turn on the camera ,COMMA turn out the lights .PERIOD 
i knew my forward speed ,COMMA i knew the area ,COMMA and so i could figure out how many hundreds of sources there were per cubic meter .PERIOD 
so it uses its red bioluminescence like a sniper's scope to be able to sneak up on animals that are blind to red light and be able to see them without being seen .PERIOD 
and a lot of animals will use their bioluminescence as a lure .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA she's got a lure that she sticks out in front of this living mousetrap of needle-sharp teeth in order to attract in some unsuspecting prey .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA now we believe that the different shape of the lure is how the male recognizes the female in the anglerfish world ,COMMA because many of these males are what are known as dwarf males .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA this is a deep-sea version of women's lib .PERIOD 
she always knows where he is ,COMMA and she doesn't have to be monogamous ,COMMA because some of these females come up with multiple males attached .PERIOD 
and we were using a special trawling net that we were able to bring these animals up alive .PERIOD 
this is an unbelievable light show .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i've wanted for a long time to figure out a different way to explore .PERIOD 
that's me on the left ,COMMA my graduate student at the time ,COMMA erika raymond ,COMMA and lee fry ,COMMA who was the engineer on the project .PERIOD 
we're at the edge of the brine pool ,COMMA there's a fish that's swimming towards the camera .PERIOD 
dna :COLON design ,COMMA nature ,COMMA art .PERIOD these are the three things that condition my world .PERIOD 
all the guys in the rugby team couldn't understand ,COMMA but anyway - this is a meringue .PERIOD this is another sample i have .PERIOD 
it shows how you make one holistic form ,COMMA like the car industry ,COMMA and then you break up what you need .PERIOD 
it's like 21st-century henry moore .PERIOD when you see a henry moore still ,COMMA your hair stands up .PERIOD there's some amazing spiritual connect .PERIOD 
we need to be in that realm .PERIOD i want to do stuff like that .PERIOD 
this is two weeks ago in ccp in coventry ,COMMA who build parts for bentleys and so on .PERIOD 
this is what goes on in my studio everyday .PERIOD i walk - i'm traveling .PERIOD i come back .PERIOD 
i said ,COMMA you get into biopolymers .PERIOD they looked straight through me .PERIOD 
i've had this image of a water droplet for <NUM> years sitting on a hot bed .PERIOD 
you see that thing .PERIOD you do .PERIOD 
i'm not putting charles eames' furniture in buildings anymore .PERIOD 
who cares ?QUESTIONMARK 
this is called a plasnet .PERIOD 
these are my sculptures .PERIOD 
this is a room of sleep-deprived women .PERIOD 
and in the course of that ,COMMA i studied ,COMMA i met with medical doctors ,COMMA scientists ,COMMA and i'm here to tell you that the way to a more productive ,COMMA more inspired ,COMMA more joyful life is getting enough sleep .PERIOD 
and our guide was a local science teacher .PERIOD 
at the end of this day i could have filled a book just with stories about law from this one teacher .PERIOD 
we lack even a vocabulary to deal with this problem ,COMMA and that's because we have the wrong frame of reference .PERIOD 
the trial lawyers say ,COMMA well ,COMMA this legal fear makes doctors practice better medicine .PERIOD 
the fear has chilled professional interaction so thousands of tragic errors occur because doctors are afraid to speak up :COLON are you sure that's the right dosage ?QUESTIONMARK 
it goes on .PERIOD we did a study of all the rules that affect one school in new york .PERIOD the board of ed .PERIOD had no idea .PERIOD 
i mean it's just absolutely a formula for failure .PERIOD 
and why not ?QUESTIONMARK they don't trust the law .PERIOD why don't they trust the law ?QUESTIONMARK 
well how do you fix it ?QUESTIONMARK we could spend <NUM> lifetimes trying to prune this legal jungle .PERIOD 
but law is different than other kinds of uncertainties ,COMMA because it carries with it the power of state .PERIOD 
if you make people self-conscious about their judgments ,COMMA studies show you will make them make worse judgments .PERIOD 
edison stated it best .PERIOD he said ,COMMA hell ,COMMA we ain't got no rules around here ,COMMA we're trying to accomplish something .PERIOD 
all these choices involve value judgments and social norms ,COMMA not objective facts .PERIOD 
you can't run a society by the lowest common denominator .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what's needed is a basic shift in philosophy .PERIOD 
law is a human institution ;SEMICOLON responsibility is a human institution .PERIOD 
if the judge doesn't have the authority to toss out unreasonable claims ,COMMA then all of us go through the day looking over our shoulders .PERIOD 
what the world needs now is to restore the authority to make common choices .PERIOD 
the second thing i want to do is introduce my co-author and dear friend and co-teacher .PERIOD 
we certainly can't trust the bankers ,COMMA and we certainly can't trust the brokers .PERIOD 
and even as we do our own work ,COMMA all too often ,COMMA we find ourselves having to choose between doing what we think is the right thing and doing the expected thing ,COMMA or the required thing ,COMMA or the profitable thing .PERIOD 
or if they do have our interests at heart ,COMMA we worry that they don't know us well enough to figure out what they need to do in order to allow us to secure those interests .PERIOD 
in addition ,COMMA we are struggling to find some way to create incentives for people in the financial services industry that will have them more interested in serving the long-term interests even of their own companies ,COMMA rather than securing short-term profits .PERIOD 
if there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse it is that .PERIOD 
a wise person knows when to bend the rules .PERIOD 
a wise person knows when to improvise .PERIOD 
and most important ,COMMA a wise person does this improvising and rule-bending in the service of the right aims .PERIOD 
he was supporting his wife and a child ,COMMA and the child was going to parochial school .PERIOD 
then he lost his job .PERIOD 
the judge on the case ,COMMA judge lois forer thought that this made no sense .PERIOD 
he did .PERIOD he served out his sentence .PERIOD 
for ms. dewey ,COMMA this isn't why she became a teacher .PERIOD 
in the veterans' court - this was the first of its kind in the united states .PERIOD 
why has the idea spread ?QUESTIONMARK 
anyone would glom onto a criminal justice system that has this kind of a record .PERIOD 
so here's is a system-changer ,COMMA and it seems to be catching .PERIOD 
aristotle thought that practical wisdom was the key to happiness ,COMMA and he was right .PERIOD 
indeed ,COMMA we argue ,COMMA there is no substitute for wisdom .PERIOD 
first of all ,COMMA we started off the nuclear age in <NUM> .PERIOD 
we had a few nuclear weapons ,COMMA two of which we dropped on japan ,COMMA in hiroshima ,COMMA a few days later in nagasaki ,COMMA in august <NUM> ,COMMA killing about <NUM> people between those two .PERIOD 
so the goal was to evacuate the target cities .PERIOD 
we would move people out of the target cities into the countryside .PERIOD 
this disconnect was never actually resolved .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what is a nuclear terror threat ?QUESTIONMARK 
there are plans for how to create a terror farm where you could actually manufacture and develop all the components and assemble it .PERIOD 
since there is no real retribution possible that would make any difference ,COMMA since there are people willing to actually give up their lives in order to do a lot of damage to us ,COMMA it becomes apparent that the whole notion of this mutually assured destruction would not work .PERIOD 
you take it wherever you want to take it ,COMMA and you can detonate it .PERIOD 
you can't get an exact number for that kind of probability ,COMMA but what i'm trying to say is that we have all the elements of that happening .PERIOD 
i don't think we would see an all-out nuclear war any time soon ,COMMA although even that is not completely off the table .PERIOD 
there's still enough nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the superpowers to destroy the earth many ,COMMA many times over .PERIOD 
we're coming down ,COMMA and we bring that truck that you just saw somewhere in here ,COMMA in the financial district .PERIOD 
this is a 10-kiloton bomb ,COMMA slightly smaller than was used in hiroshima .PERIOD and i want to just conclude this by just giving you some information .PERIOD i think - news you could use kind of concept here .PERIOD 
and if you're in this vicinity ,COMMA you've got to get away .PERIOD 
and if you're wearing clothing ,COMMA you've taken off your clothing ,COMMA you're going to get showered down some place and remove the radiation that would be - the radioactive material that might be on you .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA no ,COMMA i wasn't <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
i wasn't really a rocket scientist ,COMMA but i was working at the jet propulsion laboratory in sunny california where it's warm ;SEMICOLON whereas now i'm in the mid-west ,COMMA and it's cold .PERIOD 
and he told me ,COMMA biosignatures ,COMMA we need to look for a biosignature .PERIOD 
and he said ,COMMA it's any measurable phenomenon that allows us to indicate the presence of life .PERIOD 
but immediately the system goes like ,COMMA what kind of dumb piece of code was this ?QUESTIONMARK 
so you see waves of new types taking over the other types .PERIOD 
as long as i know that there's some sort of alphabet .PERIOD 
and obviously each of these letters comes off about roughly equally frequent .PERIOD 
and if i look at french texts ,COMMA it looks a little bit different ,COMMA or italian or german .PERIOD 
it doesn't matter whether it's a poem or whether it's a mathematical text .PERIOD 
the avidians being the denizens of this computer world where they are perfectly happy replicating and growing in complexity .PERIOD 
too hot ,COMMA too hot .PERIOD 
and i'm just showing this to you again because it's so nice .PERIOD 
one of them is ,COMMA if we are able to think about life in abstract terms - and we're not talking about things like plants ,COMMA and we're not talking about amino acids ,COMMA and we're not talking about bacteria ,COMMA but we think in terms of processes - then we could start to think about life ,COMMA not as something that is so special to earth ,COMMA but that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA could exist anywhere .PERIOD 
but what really turns me on about technology is not just the ability to get more songs on mp3 players .PERIOD 
what i would like to see is idealism decoupled from all constraints .PERIOD 
political ,COMMA economic ,COMMA psychological ,COMMA whatever .PERIOD 
don't ask .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA i turned him down .PERIOD 
that's not a cause .PERIOD that's an emergency .PERIOD 
and what we're facing in africa is an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality .PERIOD 
that's right .PERIOD 
we like to give ,COMMA and we give a lot .PERIOD 
you see ,COMMA africa makes a fool of our idea of justice .PERIOD 
africa is a continent in flames .PERIOD 
anyway ,COMMA i believe that that kind of thinking offends the intellectual rigor in this room .PERIOD 
there's an opportunity here ,COMMA and it's real .PERIOD 
our credibility ?QUESTIONMARK 
i can't ;SEMICOLON you can't ,COMMA as individuals ;SEMICOLON but we can change the world .PERIOD 
but working together ,COMMA we can actually change the world .PERIOD 
ideas that you gestated in your youth .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA now ,COMMA actually because of you ,COMMA it is possible to change the physical world .PERIOD 
so why ,COMMA then ,COMMA are we not pumping our fists into the air ?QUESTIONMARK 
but for the first time in history ,COMMA we have the technology ;SEMICOLON we have the know-how ;SEMICOLON we have the cash ;SEMICOLON we have the life-saving drugs .PERIOD 
the clash wore big army boots ,COMMA not sandals .PERIOD 
but some of them they haven't .PERIOD 
not only in lives saved ,COMMA but in goodwill ,COMMA stability and security that we'll gain .PERIOD 
what i hope is that beyond individual merciful acts ,COMMA that you will tell the politicians to do right by africa ,COMMA by america and by the world .PERIOD 
give us that kind of dreaming ,COMMA that kind of doing .PERIOD 
the war against terror ,COMMA yes .PERIOD 
actually we're talking to abc today about the oscars .PERIOD 
we need to get the math ;SEMICOLON we need to get the statistics out to the american people .PERIOD 
:COLON one by one they step forward ,COMMA a nurse ,COMMA a teacher ,COMMA a homemaker ,COMMA and lives are saved .PERIOD 
we can make history .PERIOD 
we can start to make poverty history .PERIOD 
the idea that the internet ,COMMA which changed all of our lives ,COMMA can transform a country - and a continent that has hardly made it to analog ,COMMA let alone digital - blows my mind .PERIOD 
communication is very important for ethiopia - will transform the country .PERIOD 
i am ,COMMA of course ,COMMA referring to none other than elvis presley .PERIOD 
and love is not love ,COMMA but being all shook up .PERIOD 
does that correspond ?QUESTIONMARK 
metaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia ,COMMA in which we understand one concept in the context of another .PERIOD 
one of the sentences was ,COMMA some jobs are jails .PERIOD 
and they had those expectations because agent metaphors imply the deliberate action of a living thing pursuing a goal .PERIOD 
but there is a better translation .PERIOD 
the latin word cogito is derived from the prefix co ,COMMA meaning together ,COMMA and the verb agitare ,COMMA meaning to shake .PERIOD 
and in that sense ,COMMA ballooning is a beautiful metaphor .PERIOD 
we want to go in a direction ,COMMA but the winds push us in another direction ,COMMA like in life .PERIOD 
and as long as we fight horizontally ,COMMA against life ,COMMA against the winds ,COMMA against what's happening to us ,COMMA life is a nightmare .PERIOD 
how do we go from the metaphor to something more practical that we can really use every day ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's not true .PERIOD 
this is very practical .PERIOD 
this is why you need people with long-term vision .PERIOD 
but we were expected to have doubts ;SEMICOLON we're expected to have fears .PERIOD 
it's to show you how much gas was left in the last bottles .PERIOD 
we landed with <NUM> kilos .PERIOD 
i had no idea how it was possible .PERIOD 
and when the capsule of my balloon was introduced officially in the air and space museum in washington ,COMMA together with the airplane of charles lindbergh ,COMMA with apollo <NUM> ,COMMA with the wright brothers' flyer ,COMMA with chuck yeager's <NUM> ,COMMA i had really a thought then .PERIOD 
it will be prohibited because we'll have to save our natural resources in a few decades from now .PERIOD 
which means that they have more proven the limits of renewable energies than the potential of it .PERIOD 
the goal is to take off ,COMMA end of this year for the first test ,COMMA but mainly next year ,COMMA spring or summer ,COMMA take off ,COMMA on our own power ,COMMA without additional help ,COMMA without being towed ,COMMA climb to <NUM> meters altitude .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA you see that this airplane is more a symbol .PERIOD 
i don't think it will transport <NUM> people in the next years .PERIOD 
and <NUM> years later there were <NUM> people in every airplane crossing the atlantic .PERIOD 
and each time we have some ice in the future ,COMMA we have to know that life will be great ,COMMA and the success will be brilliant if we dare to overcome our fear of the ice ,COMMA to go through the obstacle ,COMMA to go through the problem ,COMMA in order to see what there is on the other side .PERIOD 
i wish i could show you my yemen .PERIOD 
it was very hard ,COMMA you know ,COMMA to impose my authority .PERIOD 
but a woman's got to do what a woman's got to do .PERIOD 
it's about proving who you are and what you can do .PERIOD 
but in assuming this responsibility and going about it as you have ,COMMA you have become a bridge between an older and traditional society and the one that you are now creating at the paper .PERIOD 
and this is true .PERIOD 
well the yemen times ,COMMA across <NUM> years ,COMMA has been through so much .PERIOD 
they think that if there's anything against them ,COMMA then we are being an opposition newspaper .PERIOD 
and very ,COMMA very difficult times .PERIOD 
and he ended up writing about a story that even surprised me - hip hop - that there are young yemeni men who express themselves through dancing and puchu puchu .PERIOD 
that thing .PERIOD 
i'm not so old .PERIOD 
actually ,COMMA that's a documentary that's available online ;SEMICOLON the video's online .PERIOD 
and certainly you yourself and what you do have given us a view of the future that we will embrace and be grateful for .PERIOD 
on twitter also .PERIOD 
and it doesn't take much time to discover some really astonishing statistics with this issue .PERIOD 
it's the number one contaminant of groundwater ,COMMA drinking water ,COMMA rain water .PERIOD 
in some cases ,COMMA another species like the north american leopard frog showed that males exposed to atrazine grew eggs in their testes .PERIOD 
normally the testes should make testosterone ,COMMA the male hormone .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA this aromatase is so important in breast cancer that the latest treatment for breast cancer is a chemical called letrozole ,COMMA which blocks aromatase ,COMMA blocks estrogen ,COMMA so that if you developed a mutated cell ,COMMA it doesn't grow into a tumor .PERIOD 
pjc :COLON so speaking of estrogen ,COMMA one of the other compounds that tyrone talks about in the film is something called bisphenol a ,COMMA bpa ,COMMA which has been in the news recently .PERIOD 
so we're dosing our babies ,COMMA our newborns ,COMMA our infants ,COMMA with a synthetic estrogen .PERIOD 
so the pup you see on the bottom is affected by atrazine that its grandmother was exposed to .PERIOD 
and given the life of many of these chemicals ,COMMA generations ,COMMA years ,COMMA dozens of years ,COMMA that means that we right now are affecting the health of our grandchildren's grandchildren by things that we're putting into the environment today .PERIOD 
and this was something that was really brought home to me a year ago when i found out i was pregnant and the first scan revealed that my baby had a birth defect associated with exposure to estrogenic chemicals in the womb and the second scan revealed no heartbeat .PERIOD 
we know so much about global warming and climate change ,COMMA and yet ,COMMA we have no concept of what i've been calling internal environmentalism .PERIOD 
i'm not married ,COMMA but one year ago today ,COMMA i woke up from a month-long coma ,COMMA following a double lung transplant .PERIOD

i was dying ,COMMA and if i didn't mix that stuff up fast ,COMMA i would never leave that apartment alive .PERIOD 
i went back to the states ,COMMA anticipating i'd return to europe ,COMMA but the heart catheterization showed that i wasn't going anywhere further that a flight-for-life from johns hopkins hospital .PERIOD 
a happy patient is a healthy patient .PERIOD 
and it was right-heart failure .PERIOD 
it was a match .PERIOD 
because ,COMMA despite their problems ,COMMA i had spent my whole life training my lungs ,COMMA and i was not particularly enthusiastic about giving them up .PERIOD 
they left my chest open for two weeks .PERIOD

since the dawn of human history ,COMMA we've tried to rectify this imbalance by making art ,COMMA writing poems ,COMMA singing songs ,COMMA scripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper ,COMMA gossiping with friends .PERIOD this is nothing new .PERIOD 
it's been running for about a year and a half .PERIOD 
and i'll show you a glimpse of how this information is then visualized .PERIOD so this is we feel fine .PERIOD 
the dots exhibit human qualities .PERIOD they kind of have their own physics ,COMMA and they swarm wildly around ,COMMA kind of exploring the world of life .PERIOD 
and then they also exhibit curiosity .PERIOD 
there's also murmurs ,COMMA montage ,COMMA mobs ,COMMA metrics and mounds .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA one by one ,COMMA in reverse chronological order ,COMMA they excuse themselves ,COMMA entering the scrolling list of feelings .PERIOD 
i feel invisible to you .PERIOD 
i feel in love with carolyn .PERIOD i feel so naughty .PERIOD 
this is in response to ,COMMA what's beautiful ?QUESTIONMARK miss world .PERIOD 
and it caused me to wonder about our world today .PERIOD 
and those are the questions that inspired my new project ,COMMA which is debuting here today at ted .PERIOD 
it's called universe :COLON revealing our modern mythology .PERIOD 
this is the universe of <NUM> ,COMMA the last two months .PERIOD 
but we can actually be more specific in defining our universe .PERIOD 
so we see obama and the clintons meet in alabama .PERIOD 
you can see that this is an important story ;SEMICOLON there are a lot of things in its orbit .PERIOD if we open this up ,COMMA we get different perspectives on this story .PERIOD 
and you'll all be able to use it and kind of explore what your own personal mythology might be .PERIOD 
as you search for the things that are important to you in your world ,COMMA and then see what the constellations of those might look like .PERIOD 
we're facing this problem .PERIOD 
there is the problem .PERIOD 
and you know ,COMMA going back maybe <NUM> years in time when i got the funding to buy my first graphics computer - it was a huge machine .PERIOD 
it was cabinets of processors and storage and everything .PERIOD 
this is a data set that was captured using a ct scanner .PERIOD 
and of course all the data is inside ,COMMA so i can start rotating ,COMMA i can look at it from different angles ,COMMA and i can see that this woman had a problem .PERIOD 
and one of the applications that we've been working on - and this has gotten a little bit of traction worldwide - is the application of virtual autopsies .PERIOD 
so this is from a virtual autopsy .PERIOD 
the person was killed by stabs in the heart ,COMMA but they just deposited the knife by putting it through one of the eyeballs .PERIOD 
here's another case that i think is interesting .PERIOD 
during a physical autopsy ,COMMA if you actually have to dig through the body to find these fragments ,COMMA that's actually quite hard to do .PERIOD 
so if you have the opportunity ,COMMA please try it out .PERIOD 
it's really a hands-on experience .PERIOD 
and this is a bit of science fiction now ,COMMA so we're moving into really the future .PERIOD 
and he's also hearing our instructions when we tell him to do things .PERIOD 
and in just a second here you will see - okay ,COMMA here .PERIOD motts ,COMMA now move your left foot .PERIOD 
i can look inside of it .PERIOD 
and here it is .PERIOD here is the nose of the bear .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA <NUM> percent of the men in lesotho worked in the mines over the border ,COMMA in brutal conditions .PERIOD 
he was the son of one of the poorest families in the village .PERIOD 
perhaps the universe existed before the bang ,COMMA and the bang was just a violent event in a pre-existing universe .PERIOD 
i won't go into the details of why we think the universe is like this ,COMMA but it comes out of the math and trying to explain the physics that we know .PERIOD 
and there've been bangs in the past ,COMMA and there will be bangs in the future .PERIOD 
what about africa ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's still going on .PERIOD 
what about africa's capacity to do something about these problems ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA here's the number of physicians in africa .PERIOD 
and while i was busy working - i was working on these colliding worlds ,COMMA in the day .PERIOD 
and we got lots of applicants .PERIOD 
you have to rethink ,COMMA what is the university for ?QUESTIONMARK 
no droning on at the chalkboard .PERIOD 
everyone lives together in this hotel - lecturers and students - and it's not surprising at all to find an impromptu tutorial at <NUM> a.m .PERIOD 
we especially emphasize areas of great relevance to africa's development ,COMMA because ,COMMA in those areas ,COMMA scientists working in africa will have a competitive advantage .PERIOD 
they'll publish ,COMMA be invited to conferences .PERIOD 
and aims has done extremely well .PERIOD 
five students can be educated at aims for the cost of educating one in the u.s. or europe .PERIOD 
she communicates well with the immunologists at the hospital .PERIOD 
here are the current students at aims .PERIOD there are <NUM> of them from <NUM> different countries ,COMMA including <NUM> women .PERIOD 
so now i'm going to get to my ted business .PERIOD 
i want to point out a few other exceptional people in this picture .PERIOD 
and she's now at aims .PERIOD 
and our wish has two parts :COLON one is a dream and the other's a plan .PERIOD ok .PERIOD 
our ted dream is that the next einstein will be african .PERIOD 
we want to add entrepreneurship and policy skills .PERIOD 
over the last year ,COMMA we've been visiting sites in africa ,COMMA looking at potential sites for new aims centers .PERIOD 
so we have political support right across the continent .PERIOD 
but nobody was really worried about this .PERIOD 
this is a quote ,COMMA actually ,COMMA from alan turing :COLON in <NUM> years ,COMMA it will be as easy to ask a computer a question as to ask a person .PERIOD 
this was in <NUM> .PERIOD and now ,COMMA in <NUM> ,COMMA it's still not true .PERIOD 
that's how much power this computer uses .PERIOD 
rory is a graduate student at stanford .PERIOD 
i estimate <NUM> to the <NUM> bits per second ,COMMA which is actually about very similar to what blue gene does .PERIOD 
and let me just summarize .PERIOD so the bottom line :COLON the brain processes information using <NUM> times less energy than we do right now with this computer technology that we have .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this clip is from the pbs series ,COMMA the secret life of the brain .PERIOD 
and that's basically what's going on in your brain right now as you're watching this .PERIOD 
the devices that computers use are what's called a transistor .PERIOD 
your computer uses this presence of current to represent a one ,COMMA and the absence of current to represent a zero .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA when it's open ,COMMA because these ions have to line up and flow through ,COMMA one at a time ,COMMA you get a kind of sporadic ,COMMA not steady - it's a sporadic flow of current .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA there's about <NUM> electrons can all be flowing this way .PERIOD 
what you see here is that there's these redundant connections .PERIOD 
this is kareem's dark eyes and that's the white background that you see here .PERIOD 
so we are really duplicating the kind of signals that you have on the optic nerve .PERIOD 
let me just end by saying that this is what happens when you put africa in a piano ,COMMA ok .PERIOD 
and i had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it .PERIOD 
i'm interested in finding whether or not there is a really massive ,COMMA what we like to call supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy .PERIOD 
but today ,COMMA the way i want you to understand a black hole ,COMMA for the proof of a black hole ,COMMA is to think of it as an object whose mass is confined to zero volume .PERIOD 
so why is it so important ?QUESTIONMARK 
now ,COMMA the key here is to figure out what that schwarzschild radius is .PERIOD 
it depends only on the mass of the object .PERIOD 
there are big ones .PERIOD there are little ones .PERIOD 
and there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy ,COMMA just to give you a sense of scale .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA at the center there ,COMMA that's actually where most of the starlight comes out from .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA you can't see the black hole itself ,COMMA but you can convert the gravitational energy of the black hole into the light we see .PERIOD 
and if there is a supermassive black hole ,COMMA what we need to assume is that it's a black hole on a diet .PERIOD 
and we live in the middle of it ,COMMA so when we look towards the center ,COMMA we see this plane which defines the plane of the galaxy ,COMMA or line that defines the plane of the galaxy .PERIOD 
it's the gravitational pull that makes these things orbit .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this is great ,COMMA because remember my job is to show there is a lot of mass inside a small volume .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i want to see the stars that are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible .PERIOD 
because i want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible .PERIOD 
and that buys us about a factor of <NUM> .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA without this technology you can't see the stars .PERIOD 
and this one ,COMMA this one goes around in a human lifetime .PERIOD 
and the truth is ,COMMA i'm not quite there .PERIOD 
but we actually have no alternative today to explaining this concentration of mass .PERIOD 
likewise ,COMMA for the young stars ,COMMA or in contrast ,COMMA the young stars ,COMMA they just should not be there .PERIOD 
using observations that are not the ones i've shown you today ,COMMA we can actually figure out which ones are old and which ones are young .PERIOD 
the old ones are red .PERIOD 
he didn't read a note ,COMMA and he was profoundly hearing impaired .PERIOD 
and the thing about classical music ,COMMA that what and how ,COMMA it's inexhaustible .PERIOD 
and a tough ,COMMA slouchy kid got up to bat ,COMMA and he took a swing and really connected .PERIOD 
brah dada dadadadah .PERIOD 
and whether we call them <NUM> per second ,COMMA a ,COMMA or <NUM> ,COMMA b flat - trust me ,COMMA that's right - they're just phenomena .PERIOD 
and in the <NUM> century ,COMMA it was more like this .PERIOD 
and there began to be a real difference at this point between the art of improvisation and the art of composition .PERIOD 
so in the first eight centuries or so of this tradition the big'what' was to praise god .PERIOD 
the'how' was a style called polyphony ,COMMA music of many independently moving voices that suggested the way the planets seemed to move in ptolemy's geocentric universe .PERIOD 
ah ,COMMA avaricious heaven !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
and the chords ,COMMA it turned out ,COMMA were capable of representing incredible varieties of emotions .PERIOD 
it's just these two notes in the middle .PERIOD 
and it turned out the symphony could be used for more complex issues ,COMMA like gripping ones of culture ,COMMA such as nationalism or quest for freedom or the frontiers of sensuality .PERIOD 
what happens when the music stops ?QUESTIONMARK 
where does it go ?QUESTIONMARK what's left ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's the passing on part .PERIOD it's the'why' part of it .PERIOD 
at the same time technology ,COMMA by taking over the role that notation had always played ,COMMA shifted the balance within music between instinct and intelligence way over to the instinctive side .PERIOD 
what's the long-term effect of this on us or on music ?QUESTIONMARK 
nobody knows .PERIOD 
there's just a role here for so many people - teachers ,COMMA parents ,COMMA performers - to be explorers together .PERIOD 
you can start anywhere .PERIOD ramble a bit .PERIOD 
then these two fellows came along ,COMMA and they were flying kites to develop the control systems that would ultimately enable powered human flight .PERIOD 
but unfortunately ,COMMA it relegated kites once again to be considered children's toys .PERIOD 
and it doesn't hurt to do it in a location like this either .PERIOD 
if you'd loan me your gulfstream ,COMMA i'll rip its wings off and generate you a megawatt .PERIOD 
the story starts with just a single person ,COMMA a child ,COMMA behaving a little strangely .PERIOD 
they're creating the ecosystem from which innovation emerges .PERIOD 
it's based on hundreds of hours of research ,COMMA of practice .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA here's an example - pre-internet - of this machine in action .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA you might just be a kid with a webcam ,COMMA but if you can do something that goes viral ,COMMA you get to be seen by the equivalent of sports stadiums crammed with people .PERIOD 
and even if it's not that eloquent - and it's not - it can still really make your day .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA my colleague ,COMMA june cohen ,COMMA has taken to calling it radical openness ,COMMA because it works for us each time .PERIOD 
by giving away our tedx brand ,COMMA we suddenly have a thousand-plus live experiments in the art of spreading ideas .PERIOD 
we're a social species .PERIOD 
and that's why what i'm excited about ,COMMA and what i think is under-reported ,COMMA is the significance of the rise of online video .PERIOD 
he's a unicyclist .PERIOD 
jove is a website that was founded to encourage scientists to publish their peer-reviewed research on video .PERIOD 
why do people like watching tedtalks ?QUESTIONMARK 
<NUM> years ago ,COMMA it ran into a competitor with a lethal advantage .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA today ,COMMA one person speaking can be seen by millions ,COMMA shedding bright light on potent ideas ,COMMA creating intense desire for learning and to respond - and in his case ,COMMA intense desire to laugh .PERIOD 
thousands of people are figuring out new ways to learn and ,COMMA crucially ,COMMA to respond ,COMMA completing the cycle .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA as we've thought about this ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's become clear to us what the next stage of ted's evolution has to be .PERIOD 
they used the same trash to form green manure .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
the name abegg - abegg is actually a-b-e-g-g ,COMMA and that's the main theme in the melody .PERIOD 
what i do first is ,COMMA i make a lot of little musical ideas - you can just improvise here at the piano - and i choose one of those to become my main theme ,COMMA my main melody ,COMMA like the abegg that you just heard .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA for inspiration i listened to liszt and tchaikovsky and all the great romantic composers .PERIOD 
and once i realized it ,COMMA there's a parallel between creating music and creating art ,COMMA because for your motive or your little initial idea for your drawing ,COMMA it's your character - you want to decide who do you want to draw ,COMMA or if you want to draw an original character .PERIOD 
like ,COMMA am i going to use one page ?QUESTIONMARK 
am i going to use a two-page spread like a comic book for more grandiose effect ,COMMA i guess ?QUESTIONMARK 
instead ,COMMA i'd like to try something called improvisation .PERIOD 
and that's a huge amount of data .PERIOD 
and the more technical topics ,COMMA such as architecture ,COMMA materials and ,COMMA strangely enough ,COMMA men ,COMMA those are not good topics to talk about .PERIOD 
ingenious tedtalks ,COMMA much more this green color ,COMMA etc .PERIOD et .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA since this is tedactive ,COMMA and i learned from my analysis that i should actually give you something ,COMMA i will not impose the ultimate or worst tedtalk on you ,COMMA but rather give you a tool to create your own .PERIOD 
and i call this tool the tedpad .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA if you combine this very simple ,COMMA very conservative thought - go with the grain of human nature - with all the advances in behavioral economics ,COMMA some of which we were just hearing about ,COMMA again ,COMMA i think we can achieve a real increase in well-being ,COMMA in happiness ,COMMA in a stronger society without necessarily having to spend a whole lot more money .PERIOD 
well i can't ,COMMA in the time i've got ,COMMA give huge numbers of examples ,COMMA but let me just give a few of the ways that life can change .PERIOD 
and this is so obvious ,COMMA in a way ,COMMA because you think about how all of you have changed the way we shop ,COMMA the way we travel ,COMMA the way that business is done .PERIOD 
we want to get people to be more energy efficient .PERIOD 
obviously ,COMMA here we have jfk with that incredibly simple and powerful formulation ,COMMA ask not what your country can do for you ;SEMICOLON ask what you can do for your country ,COMMA an incredibly noble sentiment .PERIOD 
but when he made that speech ,COMMA what could you do to build the stronger ,COMMA better society ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i think an even more wonderful speech ,COMMA which i'm going to read a big chunk of ,COMMA which sums up what i said at the beginning about believing there is more to life than money ,COMMA and more that we should try and measure than money .PERIOD 
some say up to five tons .PERIOD 
they're fantastic creatures .PERIOD 
so they were incredibly important animals .PERIOD 
the importance of basking sharks to the coast communities is recognized through the language .PERIOD 
and most of what we do know is based on their habit of coming to the surface .PERIOD 
and we try to guess what they're doing from their behavior on the surface .PERIOD 
and we tagged them very simply ,COMMA not very hi-tech ,COMMA with a big ,COMMA long pole .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA sharks ,COMMA fish ,COMMA are underwater most of the time .PERIOD 
and here's a couple of maps that we've done .PERIOD 
that one ,COMMA you can see that we tagged both off kerry .PERIOD 
so he did another study using microsatellites ,COMMA which are much more expensive ,COMMA much more time consuming ,COMMA and ,COMMA to his surprise ,COMMA came up with almost identical results .PERIOD 
and it's thought maybe it was a bottleneck ,COMMA a genetic bottleneck thought to be <NUM> years ago ,COMMA and this has caused a very low diversity .PERIOD 
but the average of all these studies came out - the mean is about <NUM> ,COMMA which i personally don't believe ,COMMA but then i am a skeptic .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA of those <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> were thought to be females .PERIOD 
they didn't get enough samples to really explore the genetics in enough detail .PERIOD 
and some are caught in nets ,COMMA in trawls .PERIOD 
and in about half an hour ,COMMA we got five samples ,COMMA five individual sharks ,COMMA were sampled using simon's shark slime sampling system .PERIOD 
and i was thinking of humpback whales breaching and dolphins .PERIOD 
and what you're trying to look at is the males have claspers ,COMMA which kind of dangle out behind the back of the shark .PERIOD 
and you just want to learn as much as you can as soon as you can .PERIOD 
philosophers ,COMMA dramatists ,COMMA theologians have grappled with this question for centuries :COLON what makes people go wrong ?QUESTIONMARK 
so when i read robert louis stevenson ,COMMA that wasn't fiction .PERIOD 
and apparently ,COMMA he disobeyed god ,COMMA and that's the ultimate disobedience to authority .PERIOD 
i became an expert witness for one of the guards ,COMMA sergeant chip frederick ,COMMA and in that position ,COMMA i had access to the dozen investigative reports .PERIOD 
i had access to him .PERIOD i could study him ,COMMA have him come to my home ,COMMA get to know him ,COMMA do psychological analysis to see ,COMMA was he a good apple or bad apple .PERIOD 
why ?QUESTIONMARK tier 1-a was the center for military intelligence .PERIOD 
that's one of the visual illustrations of evil .PERIOD 
who are the bad apples ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA that's a bad question .PERIOD 
and so we're interested in ,COMMA what are the external factors around the individual - the bad barrel ?QUESTIONMARK 
and social scientists stop there ,COMMA and they miss the big point that i discovered when i became an expert witness for abu ghraib .PERIOD 
this is stanley milgram ,COMMA little jewish kid from the bronx ,COMMA and he asked the question ,COMMA could the holocaust happen here ,COMMA now ?QUESTIONMARK 
he gets tied up to the shock apparatus in another room .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA he's the modern lucifer effect ,COMMA a man of god who becomes the angel of death .PERIOD 
it was a real cop car ,COMMA it was a real policeman ,COMMA and there were real neighbors in the street ,COMMA who didn't know that this was an experiment .PERIOD 
do they kill ,COMMA torture ,COMMA mutilate ?QUESTIONMARK <NUM> .PERIOD 
if you give people power without oversight ,COMMA it's a prescription for abuse .PERIOD they knew that ,COMMA and let that happen .PERIOD 
the answer is nobody ,COMMA and ,COMMA i think ,COMMA nobody on purpose .PERIOD 
banality of heroism is ,COMMA it's ordinary people who do heroic deeds .PERIOD 
he was a low-level private ,COMMA and that stopped it .PERIOD was he a hero ?QUESTIONMARK no .PERIOD 
she came down ,COMMA saw that madhouse and said ,COMMA you know what ,COMMA it's terrible what you're doing to those boys .PERIOD 
so the psychology of heroism is - we're going to end in a moment - how do we encourage children in new hero courses ,COMMA that i'm working with matt langdon - he has a hero workshop - to develop this heroic imagination ,COMMA this self-labeling ,COMMA i am a hero in waiting ,COMMA and teach them skills .PERIOD 
wesley and the guy - <NUM> and a half inches height .PERIOD 
a half an inch would have taken his head off .PERIOD 
take path one ,COMMA you're going to be a perpetrator of evil .PERIOD 
path two ,COMMA you become guilty of the evil of passive inaction .PERIOD 
we should ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA because without having this possibility of conscious minds ,COMMA we would have no knowledge whatsoever about our humanity ;SEMICOLON we would have no knowledge whatsoever about the world .PERIOD 
so much for the wonder ,COMMA now for the mystery .PERIOD 
and in that image there ,COMMA you see a variety of islands of what i call image-making regions in the brain .PERIOD 
you have the green for example ,COMMA that corresponds to tactile information ,COMMA or the blue that corresponds to auditory information .PERIOD 
but what about the self ?QUESTIONMARK 
and for a long time ,COMMA people did not even want to touch it ,COMMA because they'd say ,COMMA how can you have this reference point ,COMMA this stability ,COMMA that is required to maintain the continuity of selves day after day ?QUESTIONMARK 
i like to call it an almost infinite sameness from day to day .PERIOD 
there is the brain stem in between the cerebral cortex and the spinal cord .PERIOD 
it developed in collectives of human beings .PERIOD 
why care if it is the brain stem or the cerebral cortex and how this is made ?QUESTIONMARK 
and if we are interested ,COMMA for example ,COMMA in the fact that anti-gravity is pulling galaxies away from the earth ,COMMA why should we not be interested in what is going on inside of human beings ?QUESTIONMARK 
when i was just a little girl ,COMMA my mom started what is now the longest-running women's film festival in the world .PERIOD 
fishnet stockings .PERIOD 
i thought they were really hot .PERIOD 
there are lots of very modern political movements that have caught fire in no small part because of cultural hipness .PERIOD 
and one of our biggest successes is we get mail from teenage girls in the middle of iowa who say ,COMMA i googled jessica simpson and stumbled on your site .PERIOD 
we don't want one face .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
it's enough to make you feel very overwhelmed .PERIOD 
which brings me to my third paradox .PERIOD 
you may have guessed by now ,COMMA i did not light myself on fire .PERIOD 
cornel west says ,COMMA of course it's a failure .PERIOD 
she was talking about board meetings ,COMMA she was founding peace organizations ,COMMA she was coordinating carpools ,COMMA she was consoling friends - all these daily acts of care and creativity .PERIOD 
and surely ,COMMA at three and four years old ,COMMA i was listening to the soothing sound of her voice ,COMMA but i think i was also getting my first lesson in activist work .PERIOD 
know thyself .PERIOD 
and we feel like we have to get far ,COMMA far away to a secluded retreat ,COMMA leaving it all behind .PERIOD 
this is the term that armies use when they've lost a battle .PERIOD 
you may or may not have noticed that i'm wearing a tiny electrode on my forehead .PERIOD 
let me show you what it looks like .PERIOD 
or what if i can take that information and put it into an organic shape up on the screen ?QUESTIONMARK 
i may also be interested in knowing how focused i am ,COMMA so i can put my level of attention into the circuit board on the other side .PERIOD 
and that was responsiveness .PERIOD 
we then realized that if technology could know something about you and use it to help you ,COMMA there's an even more valuable application than that .PERIOD 
in the original zen bound game ,COMMA you play it by scrolling your fingers over the pad .PERIOD 
you have graphs and charts that tell you how your brain was doing - not just how much rope you used or what your high score is ,COMMA but what was going on inside of your mind .PERIOD 
the way these children will be able to use their new awareness to improve themselves will upend many of the damaging and widespread social stigmas that people who are diagnosed as different are challenged with .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
so i used to get my eyes tested just for fun .PERIOD 
so let me just tell you ,COMMA the great part of all of this ?QUESTIONMARK 
and so when i heard that eye specialist tell me all the things ,COMMA a big fat no ,COMMA everybody imagines i was devastated .PERIOD 
the first thing i thought about was my mom ,COMMA who was crying over beside me .PERIOD 
and that wind in my face made me believe that he was mad and i would drive .PERIOD 
oh ,COMMA for the love of god .PERIOD 
i just was so - how do i tell him ?QUESTIONMARK 
and then he said to me ,COMMA what did you want to be when you were little ?QUESTIONMARK 
i know this run so well ,COMMA by the back of my hand .PERIOD 
i count the steps and the lampposts and all those things that visually impaired people have a tendency to have a lot of meetings with .PERIOD 
and you know ,COMMA the extraordinary part of it is i just simply had no answers .PERIOD 
and nobody can tell me no .PERIOD 
yes ,COMMA you can say i can't be an archeologist .PERIOD 
i'm going to go across india on the back of an elephant .PERIOD 
and i never thought about noes anymore ,COMMA or not seeing ,COMMA or any of that kind of nothing .PERIOD 
and consequently ,COMMA we can see the result all around us .PERIOD 
i hope it's not the curb cut between the chuck e. cheese and the target store because that's not good enough for americans to be spilling their blood for .PERIOD 
this is the other side of the building .PERIOD 
and what is the message that is coming ,COMMA what are the vocabularies and grammars that are coming ,COMMA from this building and how is it informing us about who we are ?QUESTIONMARK 
you know ,COMMA this is a building designed like a dvd player .PERIOD 
anyway ,COMMA this is how you compose and assemble a downtown business building ,COMMA and this is what happened when in glens falls ,COMMA new york ,COMMA when we tried to do it again ,COMMA where it was missing ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
and that starts to be delivered in the form of the railroad suburb :COLON the country villa along the railroad line ,COMMA which allows people to enjoy the amenity of the city ,COMMA but to return to the countryside every night .PERIOD 
and that's the great non-articulated agony of suburbia and one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule .PERIOD 
i don't have any eyes on the side of my head .PERIOD i can't see .PERIOD 
so they take the first one that comes along ,COMMA often .PERIOD 
we're going to have to do something else instead .PERIOD 
so that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the residences make sense deployed in relation to the places of business ,COMMA of culture and of governance .PERIOD 
the dead malls :COLON what are we going to do with them ?QUESTIONMARK 
no amount or combination of alternative fuels is going to allow us to continue running what we're running ,COMMA the way we're running it .PERIOD 
we're going to have to do everything very differently .PERIOD 
and america's not prepared .PERIOD 
and within that context ,COMMA we can offer the kids time - something that seems in short supply in their over-scheduled lives .PERIOD 
all materials are available for use .PERIOD 
it's a great honor today to share with you the digital universe ,COMMA which was created for humanity to really see where we are in the universe .PERIOD 
nasa supported this work <NUM> years ago as part of the rebuilding of the hayden planetarium so that we would share this with the world .PERIOD 
i captured this live from my laptop in a cafe called earth matters on the lower east side of manhattan ,COMMA where i live ,COMMA and it was done as a collaborative project with the rubin museum of himalayan art for an exhibit on comparative cosmology .PERIOD 
but this our containment of the visible universe .PERIOD 
this map can be updated ,COMMA and we can add in new data .PERIOD 
we have a growing user base of this ,COMMA and we network domes .PERIOD 
so you're seeing the edge of the earth .PERIOD 
this is nepal and tibet .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA he figures out a way to download himself into his environment ,COMMA actually into a series of books .PERIOD 
i think that this is the future of interface ,COMMA it's the future of music ,COMMA the future of instruments .PERIOD 
and i'll let adam tell you .PERIOD so ,COMMA adam is a ph.d. student at mit ,COMMA an expert in music technology and medicine .PERIOD and adam and dan have become close collaborators .PERIOD 
adam boulanger :COLON yes .PERIOD so ,COMMA tod and i entered into a discussion following the tewksbury work and it was really about how dan is an expressive person ,COMMA and he's an intelligent and creative person .PERIOD and it's in his face ,COMMA it's in his breathing ,COMMA it's in his eyes .PERIOD how come he can't perform one of his pieces of music ?QUESTIONMARK that's our responsibility ,COMMA and it doesn't make sense .PERIOD 
but what about expression ?QUESTIONMARK what about that moment when an artist delivers that piece of work ?QUESTIONMARK you know ,COMMA do our technologies allow us to express ?QUESTIONMARK 
so let's do it .PERIOD so dan do you want to tell everyone about what you're going to play now ?QUESTIONMARK 
so he can go in hyperscore .PERIOD you start out by making melodies and rhythms .PERIOD 
he can place those exactly where he wants .PERIOD 
but instead of making it very literal ,COMMA showing you exactly the camera tracing ,COMMA we turned it into a graphic that shows you the basic movement ,COMMA and shows the way it's being analyzed .PERIOD 
yeah .PERIOD 
and these women sing an enchanting song ,COMMA a song so alluring that all sailors who hear it crash into the rocks and die .PERIOD 
i want to hear that song .PERIOD untie me .PERIOD 
there is first ,COMMA the present self .PERIOD 
well resisting temptation is hard ,COMMA as the <NUM> century english economist nassau william senior said ,COMMA to abstain from the enjoyment which is in our power ,COMMA or to seek distant rather than immediate results ,COMMA are among the most painful exertions of the human will .PERIOD 
so the first is ,COMMA when you've got one of these devices going ,COMMA such as this contract to write everyday or pay ,COMMA it's just a constant reminder that you have no self-control .PERIOD 
the other problem with commitment devices is that you can always weasel your way out of them .PERIOD 
and this is a timely issue .PERIOD 
and we're at a situation now where for every three baby boomers ,COMMA the mckinsey global institute predicts that two will not be able to meet their pre-retirement needs while they're in retirement .PERIOD 
he said that ,COMMA we might neglect our future selves because of some failure of belief or imagination .PERIOD 
when you make an investment ,COMMA what you're really saying is ,COMMA i accept that any one of these <NUM> things could happen to me and determine my wealth .PERIOD 
once you find an investment that you're happy with ,COMMA what people do is they click done and the markers begin to disappear ,COMMA slowly ,COMMA one by one .PERIOD 
if you save very little ,COMMA the future self is unhappy living on <NUM> percent of the income .PERIOD 
and what's nice about it is it's not something that biasing people actually ,COMMA because as one face smiles ,COMMA the other face frowns .PERIOD 
there are programs you can get to see how people might look if they smoke ,COMMA if they get too much exposure to the sun ,COMMA if they gain weight and so on .PERIOD 
hal is here ,COMMA so i think we owe it to him as well as yourself to disabuse you of that last image .PERIOD 
i began my life as a markets professional and continued to take an interest ,COMMA but most of my recent effort has been looking at the value of what comes to human beings from nature ,COMMA and which doesn't get priced by the markets .PERIOD 
and the answer is :COLON yeah ,COMMA it can .PERIOD 
biodiversity ,COMMA the living fabric of this planet ,COMMA is not a gas .PERIOD 
and if you look at the species level ,COMMA you saw about fish .PERIOD 
and at this rate at which we are losing fish ,COMMA it is a human problem of enormous dimensions ,COMMA a health problem of a kind we haven't seen before .PERIOD 
the green represents the percentage .PERIOD 
the reason this is happening boils down ,COMMA in my mind ,COMMA to one basic problem ,COMMA which is our inability to perceive the difference between public benefits and private profits .PERIOD 
we tend to constantly ignore public wealth simply because it is in the common wealth ,COMMA it's common goods .PERIOD 
it causes pollutants being issued ,COMMA which have an economic cost ,COMMA health cost and so on .PERIOD 
when we measure gdp as a measure of economic performance at the national level ,COMMA we don't include our biggest asset at the country level .PERIOD 
when we measure corporate performances ,COMMA we don't include our impacts on nature and what our business costs society .PERIOD 
that has to stop .PERIOD 
so clearly there was a problem with deforestation .PERIOD 
and i couldn't answer because neither of these companies ,COMMA good though they are and professional though they are ,COMMA do not calculate or disclose their externalities .PERIOD 
that's an example ,COMMA i think ,COMMA for us to look at and for us to draw comfort from .PERIOD 
if more companies did this ,COMMA and if more sectors engaged this as sectors ,COMMA you could have analysts ,COMMA business analysts ,COMMA and you could have people like us and consumers and ngos actually look and compare the social performance of companies .PERIOD 
has already set up a coalition to do this ,COMMA an international coalition .PERIOD 
a bit like inflation :COLON you over-issue currency ,COMMA you get what you see ,COMMA declining prices .PERIOD 
so in selecting targets of <NUM> parts per million and selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations ,COMMA what we have done is we've made an ethical choice .PERIOD 
i decided when i was asked to do this that what i really wanted to talk about was my friend richard feynman .PERIOD 
richard feynman was a very complex man .PERIOD 
he was a man of many ,COMMA many parts .PERIOD 
it may still exist ;SEMICOLON i don't know .PERIOD 
but it was really brutal .PERIOD 
but the amazing thing was - feynman had to leave a little early .PERIOD 
sometimes i would win ,COMMA mostly he would win ,COMMA but we both enjoyed them .PERIOD 
and he said ,COMMA leonardo ,COMMA were you closer to your mother or to you father when you were a kid ?QUESTIONMARK 
being dick ,COMMA he ,COMMA of course ,COMMA wanted to check this .PERIOD 
there went that theory down the trashcan of history .PERIOD 
but let me tell you a little bit about feynman the physicist .PERIOD 
he would try to visualize it ,COMMA guided by a small number of simple principles .PERIOD 
it was so simple ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA that i suspect a really smart high school student ,COMMA who didn't even have calculus ,COMMA could understand what he wrote down .PERIOD 
you simply take the proton ,COMMA and you hit it really sharply with an electron .PERIOD 
so i think i'll just finish up by saying i actually don't think feynman would have liked this event .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
when this trailer showed up at my shop in berkeley ,COMMA i'd actually never stepped foot in an airstream trailer ,COMMA or any other trailer .PERIOD 
i decided i had to do some research and really figure out what had gone wrong somewhere along the history of airstream .PERIOD 
there's no such things as two walls and a ceiling coming together ,COMMA where you can change materials and shapes .PERIOD 
that's the trailer ,COMMA pretty much finished .PERIOD 
i thought ,COMMA finally ,COMMA oh yeah great ,COMMA big company ,COMMA i'm gon na work with somebody with money for tooling and molding .PERIOD 
welcome to five dangerous things you should let your children do .PERIOD 
we put warnings on coffee cups to tell us that the contents may be hot .PERIOD 
so where does this trend stop ?QUESTIONMARK 
and yeah ,COMMA they're going to cut themselves .PERIOD 
so practicing throwing things has been shown to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobes ,COMMA which have to do with visual acuity ,COMMA <NUM> understanding ,COMMA and structural problem solving ,COMMA so it gives a sense - it helps develop their visualization skills and their predictive ability .PERIOD 
number four - deconstruct appliances .PERIOD 
and it's fun for the whole family .PERIOD 
narrator :COLON we are all aware of the risk of cancer ,COMMA but there's another disease that's destined to affect even more of us :COLON arthritis .PERIOD 
this is the field of biologic replacements ,COMMA where we replace worn-out parts with new ,COMMA natural ones .PERIOD 
and it works ,COMMA not just for my wife ,COMMA but certainly for other patients .PERIOD 
and so that's not going to be a solution that's going to get us global with biologic tissue .PERIOD 
how are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement ?QUESTIONMARK 
the space age began <NUM> years ago in october ,COMMA and that ’ s exactly what sputnik looked like .PERIOD 
they would bring them back and mount them .PERIOD 
so that ’ s for fun .PERIOD 
you can see how portable and handy it was to have your own guttenberg in <NUM> .PERIOD 
in <NUM> ,COMMA nobody could read .PERIOD 
but why is this so interesting ?QUESTIONMARK here ’ s the quick story .PERIOD 
that is why the printing press succeeded ,COMMA and that is why martin luther nailed his <NUM> theses to the door :COLON because he was complaining that the catholic church had gone amok in printing out indulgences and selling them in every town and village and city in all of western europe .PERIOD 
instead of showing an object from the stage i ’ m going to do something special for the first time .PERIOD 
we are going to show ,COMMA actually ,COMMA what the library looks like ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
and all throughout the library are different objects ,COMMA different spaces .PERIOD 
and yet ,COMMA looking at them ,COMMA you would see a machine and a molecule .PERIOD 
and what does a lump of coal have to do with the internet ?QUESTIONMARK 
what that means is ,COMMA a 200-megabyte file looks like this ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
the ego is not supposed to be involved in graphic design .PERIOD 
so then i can add some color in with the background and add a bit more color in with the words themselves ,COMMA and this way ,COMMA working with the art director ,COMMA i'm able to bring it to just the right point that it's puzzling for the audience - they can figure out that there's something they have to read - but it's not impossible for them to read .PERIOD 
so i'm currently working on a book ,COMMA which plays with both senses of the word ,COMMA as i explore some of my own ideas and inquiries in a visual display of rather peacock-like grandeur .PERIOD 
i've been sending out valentines on a fairly large scale since <NUM> .PERIOD 
there's a longer story to this ,COMMA but i did get them all done in time ,COMMA and they were extremely well received .PERIOD 
i got an almost <NUM> percent response rate .PERIOD 
i had this idea that i wanted people to receive a kind of mysterious love letter ,COMMA like a found fragment in their mailbox .PERIOD 
and i specifically wrote four pages that don't connect .PERIOD 
i'm certain i can see you blushing .PERIOD 
so i solicited friends to send me their used christmas cards ,COMMA and i made <NUM> of these .PERIOD 
what does it say ?QUESTIONMARK 
so that's why i do what i do ,COMMA and why i spend so much time and effort on it ,COMMA and why i work in the commercial ,COMMA public sphere ,COMMA as opposed to the isolated ,COMMA private sphere of fine art :COLON because i want as many people as possible to see my work ,COMMA notice it ,COMMA be drawn into it ,COMMA and be able to take something from it .PERIOD 
and i actually really feel that it's worthwhile to spend my valuable and limited time on this earth in this way .PERIOD 
and i thank you for allowing me to show it to you .PERIOD 
the main characteristics of such a system is that there's one sole contact point to the ground .PERIOD 
he's now keeping a constant distance to thomas .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA who wouldn't like to take a ride on one of these .PERIOD 
and i say ,COMMA what is the light bulb good for ?QUESTIONMARK 
even when you're standing in front of a megaphone ,COMMA it's pretty much every direction .PERIOD 
i got this waterfall i recorded in my back yard .PERIOD 
you have to be kind of smart ,COMMA and though i did not graduate from college doesn't mean i'm stupid ,COMMA because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today .PERIOD 
we're just starting to really discover the laws of nature and science and physics .PERIOD 
i have been really lucky with this technology :COLON all of a sudden as it is ready ,COMMA the world is ready to accept it .PERIOD 
this unit that i played goes from about <NUM> hertz to above the range of hearing .PERIOD 
it's actually emitting ultrasound - low-level ultrasound - that's about <NUM> vibrations per second .PERIOD 
and the sound that you're hearing ,COMMA unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face ,COMMA is made out in front of it ,COMMA in the air .PERIOD 
or you can whisper in the ear of a supposed terrorist some biblical verse .PERIOD 
we put it on a turret with a camera ,COMMA so that when they shoot at you ,COMMA you're over there ,COMMA and it's there .PERIOD 
i took it back to the pentagon after it got declassified ,COMMA when the patent issued ,COMMA and told the people back there about it ,COMMA and they laughed ,COMMA and then i took them back a demo and they bought .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i've been really lucky as an inventor .PERIOD 
i've got a coke can opening that's right in your head ;SEMICOLON that's really cool .PERIOD 
appreciate it very much .PERIOD 
i thought i would talk a little bit about how nature makes materials .PERIOD 
i've been fascinated by how nature makes materials ,COMMA and there's a lot of sequence to how they do such an exquisite job .PERIOD 
so that's the vision that i've been thinking about .PERIOD 
there's diatoms made out of sio2 ,COMMA and they're magnetotactic bacteria that make small ,COMMA single-domain magnets used for navigation .PERIOD 
and i was really fortunate to have president obama visit my lab this year on his visit to mit ,COMMA and i really wanted to give him a periodic table .PERIOD 
what if he says ,COMMA'oh ,COMMA i already have one ,COMMA' or ,COMMA' i've already memorized it' ?QUESTIONMARK 
now if you take all billion viruses ,COMMA and you can put them in one drop of liquid ,COMMA you can force them to interact with anything you want on the periodic table .PERIOD 
so basically ,COMMA viruses can't replicate themselves ;SEMICOLON they need a host .PERIOD 
and so through a process of selection evolution ,COMMA we went from being able to have a virus that made a crummy battery to a virus that made a good battery to a virus that made a record-breaking ,COMMA high-powered battery that's all made at room temperature ,COMMA basically at the bench top .PERIOD 
you can make lots of amplifications to it .PERIOD 
when you shine light on them ,COMMA you can see them bubbling .PERIOD 
in this case ,COMMA you're seeing oxygen bubbles come out .PERIOD 
the last example are solar cells .PERIOD 
and what we've found is through genetic engineering ,COMMA we can actually increase the efficiencies of these solar cells to record numbers for these types of dye-sensitized systems .PERIOD 
i'll hear things like an extra room in the house ,COMMA the basement ,COMMA the coffee shop ,COMMA the library .PERIOD 
and then you'll hear things like the train ,COMMA a plane ,COMMA a car - so ,COMMA the commute .PERIOD 
why is that happening ?QUESTIONMARK 
you don't have a workday anymore .PERIOD you have work moments .PERIOD 
it's like the front door of the office is like a cuisinart ,COMMA and you walk in and your day is shredded to bits ,COMMA because you have <NUM> minutes here and <NUM> minutes there ,COMMA and then something else happens and you're pulled off your work ,COMMA and you've got to do something else ,COMMA then you have <NUM> minutes ,COMMA then it's lunch .PERIOD 
i sat at my desk .PERIOD i used my expensive computer .PERIOD 
you might have a quick idea ,COMMA but to be in deep thought about a problem and really consider a problem carefully ,COMMA you need long stretches of uninterrupted time .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA there are different kinds of distractions ,COMMA but there aren't the really bad kinds of distractions that i'll talk about in just a minute .PERIOD 
so sleep is about sleep phases ,COMMA or stages - some people call them different things .PERIOD 
if you're interrupted and woken up ,COMMA you have to start again .PERIOD 
i don't think anyone would say yes .PERIOD 
they'll also say - sometimes they'll also say ,COMMA well ,COMMA if i can't see the person ,COMMA how do i know they're working ?QUESTIONMARK 
which is ridiculous ,COMMA of course ,COMMA but that's one of the excuses that managers give .PERIOD 
no one cared about letting people take a smoke break for <NUM> minutes <NUM> years ago ,COMMA so why does everyone care about someone going to facebook here and there ,COMMA or twitter here and there ,COMMA or youtube here and there ?QUESTIONMARK 
those are the real problems in the modern office today .PERIOD 
that's kind of bad .PERIOD 
and meetings are just toxic ,COMMA terrible ,COMMA poisonous things during the day at work .PERIOD 
what if they're doing important work ?QUESTIONMARK 
if there are <NUM> people in the meeting ,COMMA it's a 10-hour meeting ;SEMICOLON it's not a one-hour meeting .PERIOD 
it's <NUM> hours of productivity taken from the rest of the organization to have this one one-hour meeting ,COMMA which probably should have been handled by two or three people talking for a few minutes .PERIOD 
these things don't exist outside of the office .PERIOD 
i have about three minutes ,COMMA so that'll fit perfectly .PERIOD 
i don't know if people still do that .PERIOD 
so just the afternoon ,COMMA one thursday .PERIOD 
this is when people actually get stuff done ,COMMA is when no one's bothering them ,COMMA when no one's interrupting them .PERIOD 
all these discussions and decisions you thought you had to make at this one time at <NUM> a.m. on monday ,COMMA just forget about them ,COMMA and things will be just fine .PERIOD 
and i specialize in human behavioral research ,COMMA and applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways ,COMMA and to design for that future .PERIOD 
and it'll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that .PERIOD 
so this is interesting to us ,COMMA because the conscious and subconscious decision process implies that the stuff that you do take with you and end up using has some kind of spiritual ,COMMA emotional or functional value .PERIOD 
but if you ask people what the three most important things that they carry are - across cultures and across gender and across contexts - most people will say keys ,COMMA money and ,COMMA if they own one ,COMMA a mobile phone .PERIOD 
and a mobile phone ,COMMA it turns out ,COMMA is a great recovery tool .PERIOD 
but - and it's a pretty big but - we forget .PERIOD 
i think ,COMMA quite a nice feature .PERIOD 
and these things don't stay in the center of gravity ,COMMA but over time ,COMMA they gravitate there .PERIOD 
but the difference between this and that is ,COMMA there's no central authority trying to control this .PERIOD 
and ok ,COMMA if you break one of these things here ,COMMA you return it to the carrier .PERIOD 
they'll probably give you three new ones ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
it challenges the norms .PERIOD 
this is how it's shifting .PERIOD 
i'm just the messenger .PERIOD 
and companies like navigenics and dna direct and 23andme ,COMMA that are giving you your genetic profiles ,COMMA are giving some people a sense of ,COMMA gosh ,COMMA well ,COMMA what can i do about it ?QUESTIONMARK 
and so my request is ,COMMA please ,COMMA let's make technologies that make people more human ,COMMA and not less .PERIOD 
i made a lot of mistakes and dumb decisions ,COMMA of course .PERIOD 
so let's say for instance that you're on your way to your best friend's wedding and you're trying to get to the airport and you're stuck in terrible traffic ,COMMA and you finally arrive at your gate and you've missed your flight .PERIOD 
we wish we'd taken better advantage of the education that we did have .PERIOD 
odds are ,COMMA you're not going to care in five years .PERIOD 
it feels terrible .PERIOD regret feels awful .PERIOD 
and the thought was ,COMMA make it go away !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
we just want it to vanish .PERIOD 
make it go away .PERIOD make it go away .PERIOD 
in point of fact ,COMMA no insurance covers acts of idiocy .PERIOD 
and the problem is that there are certain things that happen in life that we desperately want to change and we cannot .PERIOD 
but first i want to say that the intensity and persistence with which we experience these emotional components of regret is obviously going to vary depending on the specific thing that we're feeling regretful about .PERIOD 
the fda estimates that of all the americans who have tattoos ,COMMA <NUM> percent of us regret getting them .PERIOD 
now in my case ,COMMA this really wasn't a problem ,COMMA because it's actually very easy to laugh at yourself when you're <NUM> years old and you want your mommy because you don't like your new tattoo .PERIOD 
all right .PERIOD 
and what i loved about this image of the compass was that i felt like it encapsulated both of these ideas in one simple image .PERIOD 
even in wealthy countries it is common now to see inequality growing .PERIOD 
in the united states ,COMMA since <NUM> we've had five years of economic growth ,COMMA five years of productivity growth in the workplace ,COMMA but median wages are stagnant and the percentage of working families dropping below the poverty line is up by four percent .PERIOD 
it is also unstable .PERIOD 
because primarily of the power of the internet ,COMMA people of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money that can change the world for some public good if they all agree .PERIOD 
you saw one reference to that in what we were able to do with aids drugs .PERIOD 
when i got out of office and was asked to work ,COMMA first in the caribbean ,COMMA to try to help deal with the aids crisis ,COMMA generic drugs were available for about <NUM> dollars a person a year .PERIOD 
we need a movie on those six categories .PERIOD 
and all of you need to have it embedded in your brains and to organize yourselves around it .PERIOD 
you think about whatever your life has been ,COMMA however many obstacles you have faced in your life ,COMMA at critical junctures you always knew there was a predictable connection between the effort you exerted and the result you achieved .PERIOD 
as poor as haiti is ,COMMA in the area where farmer's clinic is active - and they serve a catchment area far greater than the medical professionals they have would indicate they could serve - since <NUM> ,COMMA they have not lost one person to tuberculosis ,COMMA not one .PERIOD 
we're essentially implementing what paul farmer did in haiti :COLON he develops and trains paid community health workers who are able to identify health problems ,COMMA ensure that people who have aids or tb are properly diagnosed and take their medicine regularly ,COMMA who work on bringing about health education ,COMMA clean water and sanitation ,COMMA providing nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of health care if they have problems of the severity that require it .PERIOD 
the procedures that make this work have been perfected ,COMMA as i said ,COMMA by paul farmer and his team in their work in rural haiti over the last <NUM> years .PERIOD 
and the results were so good that the rwandan government has now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country ,COMMA and has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it .PERIOD 
and then we have others working in these other related programs .PERIOD 
so she now works full-time on this for very little pay .PERIOD 
and not a single soul in this area was being treated for aids or tuberculosis .PERIOD 
listen to this :COLON less than four-tenths of one percent of those being treated stopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment .PERIOD 
we're now working with partners in health and the ministry of health in rwanda and our foundation folks to scale this system up .PERIOD 
we need initial upfront investment to train doctors ,COMMA nurses ,COMMA health administration and community health workers throughout the country ,COMMA to set up the information technology ,COMMA the solar energy ,COMMA the water and sanitation ,COMMA the transportation infrastructure .PERIOD 
i had a really hard time in school .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA my mother told me eventually that i was the little kid in the village who cried all the way to school .PERIOD 
i ran away .PERIOD 
and when the natural breeze isn't enough ,COMMA the kids deploy bubbles ,COMMA but not the kind of bubbles you know .PERIOD 
they know they can control their world .PERIOD 
landscaping .PERIOD 
they're part of the rice cycle and these skills will be valuable for them in their future .PERIOD 
the food is incredible .PERIOD 
green school is a place of pioneers ,COMMA local and global .PERIOD 
the kids are from <NUM> countries .PERIOD 
you practice ancient balinese arts .PERIOD 
the kids love it .PERIOD 
and together these volunteers and the teachers are deeply committed to creating a new generation of global ,COMMA green leaders .PERIOD 
the green school effect - we don't know what it is .PERIOD 
and how did we do all this ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's a double helix .PERIOD 
from the time the foundations were finished ,COMMA in three months it had roofs and floors .PERIOD 
you ruined my life ,COMMA but you gave me an incredible future .PERIOD 
and then a third attempt ,COMMA which also patched me back together pretty well ,COMMA until it failed .PERIOD 
i tried out various computer voices that were available online ,COMMA and for several months i had a british accent ,COMMA which chaz called sir lawrence .PERIOD 
there are all sorts of html codes you can use to control the timing and inflection of computer voices ,COMMA and i've experimented with them .PERIOD 
but what value do we place on the sound of our own voice ?QUESTIONMARK 
but it wasn't that simple .PERIOD 
or roger <NUM> .PERIOD 
this is the first version of my computer voice .PERIOD 
when i read something ,COMMA it will read in my voice .PERIOD 
the voice was created by a company in scotland named cereproc .PERIOD 
i plan to use it on television ,COMMA radio and the internet .PERIOD 
people who need a voice should know that most computers already come with built-in speaking systems .PERIOD 
john hunter :COLON all my life i was a motormouth .PERIOD 
i doubt ,COMMA on that day <NUM> years ago ,COMMA they even dreamed of what salman khan has accomplished .PERIOD

i have learned from wikipedia that ,COMMA starting with that humble beginning ,COMMA plato established forums ,COMMA message boards ,COMMA online testing ,COMMA email ,COMMA chat rooms ,COMMA picture languages ,COMMA instant messaging ,COMMA remote screen sharing and multiple-player games .PERIOD 
but online ,COMMA everybody speaks at the same speed .PERIOD 
ironic that my legs are fine ,COMMA and it's my shoulders that slow up my walk .PERIOD

let me tell you my story .PERIOD 
i came to london ,COMMA and i've seen performance by cirque du soleil .PERIOD 
i wanted my artistic statement ,COMMA my interpretation of reality .PERIOD 
the secret is that we were treating the whole newspaper as one piece ,COMMA as one composition - like music .PERIOD 
and design is responsible for this experience .PERIOD 
what really makes it amazing :COLON that the circulation of these newspapers were growing too .PERIOD 
same in poland :COLON plus <NUM> ,COMMA up to <NUM> percent raise of circulation after three years .PERIOD 
you can work for a small company ,COMMA in a boring branch .PERIOD 
so bear with me as i take you through this journey .PERIOD 
i was running across the street ,COMMA and the only thing that i actually remember is feeling like a grenade went off in my head .PERIOD 
and i remember putting my hands on the ground and feeling my life's blood emptying out of my neck and my mouth .PERIOD 
i had no idea what was going on ,COMMA but strangers intervened ,COMMA kept my heart moving ,COMMA beating .PERIOD 
i had lots of titanium put in me ,COMMA cadaver bones to try to get my feet moving the right way .PERIOD 
and i needed that wisdom at that moment in my life .PERIOD 
so they eventually started matching their talents and skills to all of my needs .PERIOD 
so they figured not being able to see is one thing ,COMMA but they need to get me to talk .PERIOD 
the redundancy was actually good for me .PERIOD 
so everything is different when you're a sighted person because you take that for granted .PERIOD 
we didn't have words like crowd-sourcing and radical collaboration when i had my accident .PERIOD 
a peasant ,COMMA who was walking to market that morning ,COMMA ran towards where the gunshot had come from ,COMMA and found a young man writhing in agony on the floor ,COMMA clearly shot by a dueling wound .PERIOD 
galois was taken to the local hospital where he died the next day in the arms of his brother .PERIOD 
and the last words he said to his brother were ,COMMA don't cry for me ,COMMA alfred .PERIOD 
but a few years earlier ,COMMA while still at school ,COMMA he'd actually cracked one of the big mathematical problems at the time .PERIOD 
symmetry can also help us to explain what's happening in the large hadron collider in cern .PERIOD 
artists too love to play around with symmetry .PERIOD 
here is thomas mann talking about symmetry in the magic mountain .PERIOD 
and the gateway you see behind has eight columns ,COMMA with beautiful symmetrical designs on them .PERIOD 
and i said to professor kurokawa ,COMMA wow ,COMMA the architects must have really been kicking themselves when they realized that they'd made a mistake and put this one upside down .PERIOD 
recently i took my family - we do these rather kind of nerdy mathematical trips ,COMMA which my family love .PERIOD 
i think one of the problems about school mathematics is it doesn't look at how mathematics is embedded in the world we live in .PERIOD 
so they explored a more geometric art .PERIOD 
and the power of mathematics is often to change one thing into another ,COMMA to change geometry into language .PERIOD 
actually ,COMMA the invention of the number zero was a very modern concept ,COMMA seventh century a.d. by the indians .PERIOD 
i can reflect it in the line through x ,COMMA or the line through y ,COMMA or the line through z .PERIOD 
so both of these objects have six symmetries .PERIOD 
so the little table here records how the algebra of these symmetries work .PERIOD 
and this enables us to distinguish why the symmetries of these objects - they both have six symmetries .PERIOD so why shouldn't we say they have the same symmetries ?QUESTIONMARK 
and ,COMMA using those rules ,COMMA he was able to say that there are in fact only two objects with six symmetries .PERIOD 
and all the tiles match up again .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA there was a sixth of a turn .PERIOD a third of a turn where the z pieces meet .PERIOD 
how many symmetries does a rubik's cube have ?QUESTIONMARK 
rather than you all shouting out ,COMMA i want you to count how many digits there are in that number .PERIOD okay ?QUESTIONMARK 
because this one .PERIOD i think there were a few here .PERIOD 
the people who just last sat down .PERIOD 
and i'd like to review just how unintended consequences play the part that they do .PERIOD 
but he did his best ,COMMA and he kept meticulous records that let him transform that branch of medicine .PERIOD 
so there were benefits in calamities - benefits to pure science ,COMMA as well as to applied science and medicine .PERIOD 
there are two historians of business at the university of maryland ,COMMA brent goldfarb and david kirsch ,COMMA who have done some extremely interesting work ,COMMA much of it still unpublished ,COMMA on the history of major innovations .PERIOD 
they have combined the list of major innovations ,COMMA and they've discovered that the greatest number ,COMMA the greatest decade ,COMMA for fundamental innovations ,COMMA as reflected in all of the lists that others have made - a number of lists that they have merged - was the great depression .PERIOD 
so we see that sometimes ,COMMA as a result of these dislocations ,COMMA as a result of people leaving their original intended career and going into something else where their creativity could make a difference ,COMMA that depressions and all kinds of other unfortunate events can have a paradoxically stimulating effect on creativity .PERIOD 
we need to see what they can do for us .PERIOD 
it's kind of like a new approach to desktop computing .PERIOD 
and some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system .PERIOD 
also just like paper ,COMMA around our workspace we'll pin things up to the wall to remember them later ,COMMA and i can do the same thing here ,COMMA and you know ,COMMA you'll see post-it notes and things like that around people's offices .PERIOD 
so one thing we have for that is like a grid align ,COMMA kind of - so you get that more traditional desktop .PERIOD things are kind of grid aligned .PERIOD 
the photo was made when we were deep in the valley over there .PERIOD 
but i think the point is that this is metaphor with teeth ,COMMA and it's with those teeth that i want to propose today that we rethink a little bit about the role of contemporary math - not just financial math ,COMMA but math in general .PERIOD 
and he said ,COMMA it's funny you ask that ,COMMA because it's actually called black box trading .PERIOD 
there's a company in boston called nanex ,COMMA and they use math and magic and i don't know what ,COMMA and they reach into all the market data and they find ,COMMA actually sometimes ,COMMA some of these algorithms .PERIOD 
and when they find them they pull them out and they pin them to the wall like butterflies .PERIOD 
pragmatic chaos is ,COMMA like all of netflix algorithms ,COMMA trying to do the same thing .PERIOD 
pragmatic chaos ,COMMA like all netflix algorithms ,COMMA determines ,COMMA in the end ,COMMA <NUM> percent of what movies end up being rented .PERIOD 
wouldn't that be handy ?QUESTIONMARK 
and it uses what's called a bin-packing algorithm .PERIOD 
and this is really where the wires come right up into the city .PERIOD 
but before i dive into those i want to admit that i am an optimist .PERIOD 
and part of the reason i feel that way is looking at the past .PERIOD 
another statistic ,COMMA perhaps my favorite ,COMMA is to look at childhood deaths .PERIOD 
the next breakthrough is to cut that <NUM> million in half again .PERIOD 
why ?QUESTIONMARK well there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths :COLON diarrhea ,COMMA pneumonia and malaria .PERIOD 
and the disease was all over the world .PERIOD 
and two tools helped bring the death rate down .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA malaria - even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact .PERIOD 
over <NUM> million people at any one time are suffering from it .PERIOD 
and bed nets are a great tool .PERIOD 
so every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective .PERIOD 
it involves communicators to keep the funding high ,COMMA to keep the visibility high ,COMMA to tell the success stories .PERIOD 
it involves social scientists ,COMMA so we know how to get not just <NUM> percent of the people to use the bed nets ,COMMA but <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
it seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on ,COMMA and we'd understand very well .PERIOD 
let's start with why this is important .PERIOD 
not only has that been weak .PERIOD it's getting weaker .PERIOD 
and the answer is no .PERIOD 
but it in no way is associated with being a better teacher .PERIOD 
they have <NUM> schools - mostly middle schools ,COMMA some high schools - and what goes on is great teaching .PERIOD 
if you have a kid who's behind ,COMMA you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept .PERIOD 
i'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book .PERIOD 
i only have three minutes so i'm going to have to talk fast ,COMMA and it will use up your spare mental cycles ,COMMA so multitasking may be hard .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it's logical that you'd have one there ,COMMA on the minor road entering the major .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA the question is ,COMMA what does that cost us ?QUESTIONMARK 
that's just the gasoline cost .PERIOD there is also pollution ,COMMA wear on the car ,COMMA and time .PERIOD 
discount that back to the present ,COMMA at five percent :COLON over two million dollars for a stop sign ,COMMA in each direction .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA if you look at what that adjacent property is worth ,COMMA you could actually buy the property ,COMMA cut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line ,COMMA and then sell it off again .PERIOD 
and because we no longer need to use sunlight ,COMMA we have very specialized lights that are made for the operating room .PERIOD 
and this is what i think is the magic of fluorescence .PERIOD 
that's what the surgeon is saying in the operating room when the patient's on the table .PERIOD 
but then we actually don't know that it's all out .PERIOD 
and we wait .PERIOD 
so now you're faced with telling your patient ,COMMA first of all ,COMMA that they may need another surgery ,COMMA or that they need additional therapy such as radiation or chemotherapy .PERIOD 
so even if the tumor is not right on the surface ,COMMA you'll still be able to see it .PERIOD 
so if you're driving on the freeway and you want to know where's the next gas station ,COMMA you have a map to tell you that that gas station is down the road .PERIOD 
so with our technology ,COMMA we can tell right away .PERIOD 
nerves ,COMMA if they are injured ,COMMA can cause paralysis ,COMMA can cause pain .PERIOD 
but you know what ,COMMA these little nerves are so small ,COMMA in the context of prostate cancer ,COMMA that they are actually never seen .PERIOD 
people said ,COMMA we've been doing it this way for all these years .PERIOD 
but i went ahead anyway .PERIOD 
we have been able to see nerves for facial expression ,COMMA for facial movement ,COMMA for breathing - every single nerve - nerves for urinary function around the prostate .PERIOD 
i have patients who would benefit from this .PERIOD 
i think that this will result in my surgeries with a better outcome and fewer complications .PERIOD 
and this takes the long-term steady courage of the day-in day-out struggle to educate ,COMMA to persuade and to win acceptance .PERIOD 
and that is the light that i want to shine on health and medicine today .PERIOD 
they receive input from thousands of upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs ,COMMA which then ,COMMA if they pass a certain threshold ,COMMA will go to thousands of downstream partners .PERIOD 
if we could activate cells ,COMMA we could see what powers they can unleash ,COMMA what they can initiate and sustain .PERIOD 
now in the <NUM> century ,COMMA there was some hope that was generated through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders ,COMMA and while many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders ,COMMA practically none of them can be considered to be cured .PERIOD 
there's one other magic trick you need to make this all happen ,COMMA and that's the ability to get light into the brain .PERIOD 
so how do we do this ?QUESTIONMARK 
and one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear .PERIOD 
and over time - in this case ,COMMA a mouse ,COMMA which is a good animal model ,COMMA commonly used in such experiments - the animal learns to fear the tone .PERIOD 
the animal will react by freezing ,COMMA sort of like a deer in the headlights .PERIOD 
now i want to close on one story ,COMMA which we think is another possibility - which is that maybe these molecules ,COMMA if you can do ultra-precise control ,COMMA can be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic ,COMMA an optical prosthetic .PERIOD 
maybe <NUM> people have cochlear implants ,COMMA which allow them to hear .PERIOD 
and new hope in gene therapy has been developed because viruses like the adeno-associated virus ,COMMA which probably most of us around this room have ,COMMA and it doesn't have any symptoms ,COMMA which have been used in hundreds of patients to deliver genes into the brain or the body .PERIOD 
and the retina ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is a complex structure .PERIOD 
we're going to take these blue light photosensors and install them on a layer of cells in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye and convert them into a camera - just like installing solar cells all over those neurons to make them light sensitive .PERIOD 
so this pre-clinical study ,COMMA i think ,COMMA bodes hope for the kinds of things we're hoping to do in the future .PERIOD 
and by turning things off ,COMMA it's more or less a zero .PERIOD 
does that mean that some day you could download memories and maybe upload them ?QUESTIONMARK 
what determines the types and distributions of microbes indoors ?QUESTIONMARK 
and we looked at three different types of rooms .PERIOD 
hospitals use two and a half times the amount of energy as office buildings .PERIOD 
i've heard somebody say that you're as healthy as your gut .PERIOD 
and obviously i'm physically a very strong person ,COMMA as you can tell - - so i wasn't worried about carrying this thing <NUM> blocks .PERIOD 
people were out .PERIOD 
and i thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA this is the power of a city .PERIOD 
but the system itself of this city was thriving .PERIOD 
everybody contributes a little bit .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA it was the whole city .PERIOD 
so it's been a very optimistic time ,COMMA i think ,COMMA and i want to just talk about a few of those things .PERIOD 
that is - you know ,COMMA there's no sentence that kind of conjures up that period better than that ,COMMA i think ,COMMA which is that you suddenly have the power to put up a picture of your dog and link to it ,COMMA and somebody reading the page has the power to click on that link or not click on that link .PERIOD 
but it's still a very one-to-one kind of relationship .PERIOD 
about two months ago ,COMMA i had the great breakthrough - one of my great ,COMMA kind of shining achievements - which is that my website finally became a top result for steven johnson .PERIOD 
and in fact ,COMMA i think that's not entirely true anymore .PERIOD 
that little list there would change .PERIOD 
that's not necessarily something we didn't know already .PERIOD 
i had no idea .PERIOD 
but what's interesting is you can then broaden the search and actually see interesting things and get a sense of what else is out there .PERIOD 
they're talking about slavery in <NUM> .PERIOD 
and ok ,COMMA i didn't learn anything new there as well - that's pretty obvious .PERIOD 
i'll go very quickly .PERIOD 
it's caused a lot of controversy because people thought that this was the ultimate kind of one man ,COMMA one modem democracy ,COMMA where anybody can get out there and get their voice heard .PERIOD 
and the question was ,COMMA were the birds singing ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA in my world ,COMMA this is a rubber duck .PERIOD 
that was a nice thing to get .PERIOD 
if the end game is global warming ,COMMA they're doing great .PERIOD 
so perhaps we could develop a strategy of change ,COMMA which requires humility .PERIOD and in my business as an architect ,COMMA it's unfortunate the word humility and the word architect have not appeared in the same paragraph since the fountainhead .PERIOD 
there is an infinite game ,COMMA and we're playing in that infinite game .PERIOD 
and so we call it cradle to cradle ,COMMA and our goal is very simple .PERIOD 
this is what i presented to the white house .PERIOD 
so we've designed products and we analyzed chemicals down to the parts per million .PERIOD 
we can ask ourselves ,COMMA what is justice ,COMMA and is justice blind ,COMMA or is justice blindness ?QUESTIONMARK 
is there anybody here who doesn't breathe ?QUESTIONMARK 
here's dr. venkataswamy in india ,COMMA who's figured out how to do mass-produced health .PERIOD 
they become building steel .PERIOD 
my childhood summers were in the puget sound of washington ,COMMA among the first growth and big growth .PERIOD 
my grandfather had been a lumberjack in the olympics ,COMMA so i have a lot of tree karma i am working off .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA all of a sudden ,COMMA here i am ,COMMA graduating from high school in <NUM> ,COMMA and this happens ,COMMA and we realize that away went away .PERIOD 
now if we look at the word competition ,COMMA i'm sure most of you've used it .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA most people don't realize it comes from the latin competere ,COMMA which means strive together .PERIOD 
it means the way olympic athletes train with each other .PERIOD 
so we've been looking at the idea of competition as a way of cooperating in order to get fit together .PERIOD 
now most environmentalists don't say growth is good ,COMMA because ,COMMA in our lexicon ,COMMA asphalt is two words :COLON assigning blame .PERIOD 
technical nutrition will be in an order of magnitude of biological nutrition .PERIOD 
customers .PERIOD 
biotechnical nutrients - the model u for ford motor ,COMMA a cradle to cradle car - concept car .PERIOD 
the idea here of the car is that some of the materials go back to the industry forever ,COMMA some of the materials go back to soil - it's all solar-powered .PERIOD 
we're doing <NUM> cities for china right now ,COMMA based on cradle to cradle as templates .PERIOD 
our assignment is to develop protocols for the housing for <NUM> million people in <NUM> years .PERIOD 
we start to integrate commercial and mixed use so the people all have centers and places to be .PERIOD 
and then it makes natural gas ,COMMA which then goes back into the city to power the fuel for the cooking for the city .PERIOD 
and then the compost is all taken back to the roofs of the city ,COMMA where we've got farming ,COMMA because what we've done is lifted up the city ,COMMA the landscape ,COMMA into the air to - to restore the native landscape on the roofs of the buildings .PERIOD 
they're probably less cell dense .PERIOD 
and they're controlling basically everything that the nervous system has to do .PERIOD 
because what we're trying to measure ,COMMA the rna - which is the readout from our genes - is very labile ,COMMA and so we have to move very quickly .PERIOD 
and then the laser actually cuts .PERIOD 
now this may look like a bunch of dots to you ,COMMA but each one of these individual dots is actually a unique piece of the human genome that we spotted down on glass .PERIOD 
and when we take a sample and we hybridize it to it ,COMMA we get a unique fingerprint ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA quantitatively of what genes are turned on in that sample .PERIOD 
so roughly ,COMMA we have <NUM> million data points for a given human brain .PERIOD 
green is the sort of cool areas where it's not turned on .PERIOD 
genes send the instructions to make proteins .PERIOD 
so drugs bind to proteins and either turn them off ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
it's as interesting a side effect as it could be .PERIOD 
one other thing you can do with such a thing is you can ,COMMA because it's a pattern matching exercise ,COMMA because there's unique fingerprint ,COMMA we can actually scan through the entire genome and find other proteins that show a similar fingerprint .PERIOD 
now they can come in and they can start to get clues about activity .PERIOD 
and then we find some outliers ,COMMA some things that lie beyond the cloud .PERIOD 
and those genes are interesting ,COMMA but they're very subtle .PERIOD 
these are things where genes are turned on in an individual cell type .PERIOD 
i think these resources are incredibly valuable .PERIOD 
and there is something else i believe in the back of your mind you also know .PERIOD 
and worst of all ,COMMA we will never know .PERIOD 
and the reason is that - take africa for example .PERIOD 
africans have already got a lot of aid .PERIOD 
we don't know .PERIOD 
and a third question :COLON education .PERIOD 
and in this way ,COMMA you can take the guesswork out of policy-making by knowing what works ,COMMA what doesn't work and why .PERIOD 
it's going from intention to action .PERIOD 
we cannot keep giving lentils to people .PERIOD 
we can just run an experiment .PERIOD 
second thing is ,COMMA how about the use ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA in business ,COMMA that's certainly not the way we would go about it .PERIOD 
now i'm going to show you what we get with various education interventions .PERIOD 
so now ,COMMA i started from the big problem ,COMMA and i couldn't answer it .PERIOD 
in haiti ,COMMA about <NUM> people died - actually ,COMMA a bit more by the latest estimate .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA why is that ?QUESTIONMARK 
with deworming ,COMMA you can get an extra year of education for three dollars .PERIOD 
so this evidence is powerful .PERIOD 
it can prompt action .PERIOD 
these economics i'm proposing ,COMMA it's like <NUM> century medicine .PERIOD 
fantastic tales ,COMMA anecdotes from speakers .PERIOD 
and turnarounds are part and parcel of what i have focused on for most of my professional career .PERIOD 
and she said ,COMMA i want to write a case ,COMMA euvin - a case on a public-sector leader that has lessons for the corporate world .PERIOD 
the first thing that i saw was north america at night - glowing ,COMMA in all its glory .PERIOD a warm feeling .PERIOD light .PERIOD 
entrepreneurs ,COMMA dynamic people ,COMMA people with hope .PERIOD 
so let's start shedding light on this amazing eclectic continent that has so much to offer .PERIOD 
so i want to share with you some of these bellwether signals ,COMMA or signs ,COMMA and winds of change that are sweeping this continent .PERIOD 
and let's start at the high level ,COMMA on the macro-factors .PERIOD 
egypt :COLON from the <NUM> percent to about <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
but what were they there for ?QUESTIONMARK to acquire assets .PERIOD 
guarantee trust bank recently issued the first euro bond out of africa ,COMMA and this excludes south africa .PERIOD 
<NUM> to <NUM> million barrels of oil a day - the same league as kuwait ,COMMA the same league as venezuela .PERIOD 
so let's unpack those very quickly ,COMMA and i'm going to move through these very ,COMMA very ,COMMA very fast because i can see that clock counting down .PERIOD 
what else is going on there ?QUESTIONMARK egypt .PERIOD 
close to the mediterranean ,COMMA near alexandria - textiles ,COMMA petrochemicals .PERIOD 
so what are the signs that things are fundamentally changing ?QUESTIONMARK 
what's going on in some of the other countries ?QUESTIONMARK 
but in any investment decision ,COMMA the key question is ,COMMA what is my alternative investment ?QUESTIONMARK 
now ,COMMA when looking at africa vis-a-vis other things ,COMMA and countries in africa vis-a-vis other things ,COMMA comparisons become important .PERIOD 
in <NUM> ,COMMA joseph conrad released the heart of darkness ,COMMA a tale of grim horror along the congo river .PERIOD 
brain magic to me indicates that area of magic dealing with psychological and mind-reading effects .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA now you can see how easy it is for me to manipulate the human mind ,COMMA once you know how .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA but you're ok ,COMMA yes ?QUESTIONMARK 
that is weird .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i'm going to give you some demonstrations up here ,COMMA live ,COMMA right now .PERIOD 
and let's see ,COMMA down at the end ,COMMA here ,COMMA can you also come up ,COMMA real quick ?QUESTIONMARK 
now ,COMMA it's very important for everybody here to realize i haven't set anything up with you guys .PERIOD 
you don't know what's about to happen .PERIOD is that agreed ?QUESTIONMARK 
ok ,COMMA would you mind just standing over here for a moment ?QUESTIONMARK 
your name is ?QUESTIONMARK 
ok ,COMMA a little bit closer ,COMMA come over - they look really nervous up here .PERIOD 
voodoo ?QUESTIONMARK 
besides ,COMMA who's next ,COMMA no ,COMMA ok .PERIOD 
i want you to be aware of the sensations ,COMMA but don't say anything until i ask you ,COMMA and don't open your eyes until i ask you .PERIOD 
yes or no ,COMMA did you feel anything ?QUESTIONMARK 
yeah ,COMMA i walk around nightclubs all night like this .PERIOD 
and can you take a seat right over here for me ,COMMA if you don't mind .PERIOD 
and i want you to hold it there ,COMMA just for a moment ,COMMA and i only want you to allow your hand to sink and drift and float back to the tabletop at the same rate and speed as you drift and float into this relaxed state of awareness ,COMMA and allow it to go all the way down to the tabletop .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA and only when you feel the pressure go back ,COMMA i want you to allow your hand to slowly drift back to the tabletop ,COMMA but only when you feel the pressure .PERIOD 
allow it to stick firmly to the tabletop ,COMMA keep your eyes closed .PERIOD 
can you stand up ?QUESTIONMARK 
imagine a connection between you and him .PERIOD 
point directly at his forehead .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i want you to be aware that in a moment ,COMMA when i snap my fingers ,COMMA your eyes will open ,COMMA again .PERIOD 
it's nearly impossible to break a coke bottle .PERIOD 
you see ,COMMA psychokinesis is the paranormal influence of the mind on physical events and processes .PERIOD 
be careful ,COMMA because it is sharp .PERIOD just hold on to it for a moment .PERIOD 
and i want you to release that negative energy by shaking it from side to side .PERIOD 
there's five letters in the title .PERIOD 
there's a k in his name ,COMMA there is a k .PERIOD 
you knew !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
no one in the audience .PERIOD and just to help you out ,COMMA i'll block them from view ,COMMA so nobody can see what you're doing .PERIOD 
but i don't want you to know either ,COMMA so swivel around on your chair .PERIOD 
your right hand .PERIOD is that - no ,COMMA ok .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA tell me when to stop .PERIOD 
yes ,COMMA there's one .PERIOD 
ok. do you think it's here ,COMMA yes or no ?QUESTIONMARK 
neither ,COMMA oh ,COMMA ok .PERIOD 
we're the only creatures with fully developed moral sentiments .PERIOD 
after <NUM> years of experiments ,COMMA i found it .PERIOD 
it can't be that important .PERIOD 
turns out it wasn't so easy .PERIOD 
and when it's produced ,COMMA it has a three-minute half-life ,COMMA and degrades rapidly at room temperature .PERIOD 
then i had to measure morality .PERIOD 
so i started smaller .PERIOD 
so poor countries are by and large low trust countries .PERIOD 
so we recruit some people for an experiment .PERIOD 
we give them lots of instruction ,COMMA and we never ever deceive them .PERIOD 
so think about this experiment for minute .PERIOD 
but why ?QUESTIONMARK 
two things .PERIOD 
i didn't know for sure oxytocin caused trustworthiness .PERIOD 
i used everything short of a drill to get oxytocin into my own brain .PERIOD 
these include massage ,COMMA dancing and praying .PERIOD 
in this book ,COMMA smith argued that we are moral creatures ,COMMA not because of a top-down reason ,COMMA but for a bottom-up reason .PERIOD 
so if i do something that hurts you ,COMMA i feel that pain .PERIOD 
i'm working at a gas station on the outskirts of santa barbara ,COMMA california .PERIOD 
tell that guy to wait half an hour .PERIOD 
so this is a classic con called the pigeon drop ,COMMA and i was the pigeon .PERIOD 
they have many of the attributes of psychopaths .PERIOD 
one is through improper nurturing .PERIOD 
so we've studied sexually abused women ,COMMA and about half those don't release oxytocin on stimulus .PERIOD 
she had the biggest increase in oxytocin .PERIOD 
so i think it tells us that we've designed this ritual to connect us to this new couple ,COMMA connect us emotionally .PERIOD 
so my penchant for hugging other people has earned me the nickname dr. love .PERIOD 
we have found that people who release more oxytocin are happier .PERIOD 
and they're happier because they have better relationships of all types .PERIOD 
i'll play at these rock shows ,COMMA be on stage standing completely still ,COMMA and they're like ,COMMA what's she doing ?QUESTIONMARK what's she doing ?QUESTIONMARK 
so basically ,COMMA with both of your hands you're controlling pitch and volume and kind of trying to create the illusion that you're doing separate notes ,COMMA when really it's continuously going .PERIOD 
maybe we'll go into the next tune ,COMMA because i totally lost where this is going .PERIOD 
it was invented around the <NUM> ,COMMA and the inventor ,COMMA léon theremin - he also was a musician besides an inventor - he came up with the idea for making the theremin ,COMMA i think ,COMMA when he was working on some shortwave radios .PERIOD 
and then also ,COMMA you're trying to stay very ,COMMA very ,COMMA very still because little movements with other parts of your body will affect the pitch ,COMMA or sometimes if you're holding a low note - - and breathing will make it .PERIOD 
and it's meant to kind of reflect how we engage with histories or stories on the internet ,COMMA in a less linear form .PERIOD 
he was sent in <NUM> to palestine by the zionist organization to look at areas for jewish settlement and acquire land for jewish settlement .PERIOD 
during the course of this trial ,COMMA all of the rabbits died ,COMMA except for a few ,COMMA which were euthanized .PERIOD 
so when you look at a detail of this work ,COMMA you can see ,COMMA the man on the upper-left is the father of the woman sitting next to him .PERIOD 
during the time i was in bosnia ,COMMA the mortal remains of zumra's eldest son were exhumed from a mass grave .PERIOD 
however ,COMMA the other individuals are represented by these blue slides ,COMMA which show tooth and bone samples that were matched to dna evidence collected from family members to prove they were the identities of those individuals .PERIOD 
there's also parents who participated who wouldn't let their children participate because they thought they were too young to decide for themselves .PERIOD 
it was released in poland to create friction between frank and hitler ,COMMA so that hitler would imagine frank was trying to usurp his power .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA talking about fate ,COMMA i was interested in the stories and fate of particular works of art .PERIOD 
chapter <NUM> highlights people being born into a battle that is not of their making ,COMMA but becomes their own .PERIOD 
i'm not quite sure whether i really want to see a snare drum at nine o'clock or so in the morning .PERIOD 
and it sounds quite simple ,COMMA but actually it's quite a big ,COMMA big job .PERIOD 
i will follow the instructions ,COMMA the tempo markings ,COMMA the dynamics .PERIOD 
but here i'm being told that the piece of music is very quick .PERIOD 
just the basic feeling .PERIOD 
we have to listen to ourselves ,COMMA first of all .PERIOD 
and i just feel ,COMMA at last ,COMMA one with the stick and one with the drum .PERIOD 
not just translate them ,COMMA but interpret them .PERIOD 
can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger ,COMMA there .PERIOD 
every single one of us ,COMMA depending on where we're sitting ,COMMA will experience this sound quite ,COMMA quite differently .PERIOD 
do you see what i mean ?QUESTIONMARK so ,COMMA because of this explosion in access to sound ,COMMA especially through the deaf community ,COMMA this has not only affected how music institutions ,COMMA how schools for the deaf treat sound - and not just as a means of therapy - although of course ,COMMA being a participator of music ,COMMA that definitely is the case as well .PERIOD 
may be great there ,COMMA but terrible up there .PERIOD 
we just - we go like that ,COMMA and we imagine that that's what deafness is about .PERIOD 
in a year's time ,COMMA it could be two extra steps .PERIOD 
for me ,COMMA as a musician who deals with <NUM> percent of new music ,COMMA it's very easy for me to say ,COMMA oh yes ,COMMA i like that piece .PERIOD 
oh no ,COMMA i don't like that piece .PERIOD and so on .PERIOD 
and please try to create that through your clapping .PERIOD try .PERIOD just - please try .PERIOD 
very good !EXCLAMATIONMARK snow .PERIOD snow .PERIOD have you ever heard snow ?QUESTIONMARK 
evelyn glennie :COLON well then ,COMMA stop clapping .PERIOD try again .PERIOD 
see ,COMMA you're awake .PERIOD 
however ,COMMA not one of you got out of your seats to think ,COMMA right !EXCLAMATIONMARK how can i clap ?QUESTIONMARK ok ,COMMA maybe .PERIOD 
i may feel sorrowful ,COMMA or happy ,COMMA or exhilarated ,COMMA or angry when i play certain pieces of music ,COMMA but i'm not necessarily wanting you to feel exactly the same thing .PERIOD 
the performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound ,COMMA because they're hearing the contact of the stick on the drum ,COMMA or the mallet on the bit of wood ,COMMA or the bow on the string ,COMMA etc .PERIOD or the breath that's creating the sound from wind and brass .PERIOD 
it's a video game move from star fox .PERIOD 
and we've gone from one board to <NUM> boards .PERIOD 
what the site's known for ,COMMA because it has this environment ,COMMA is it's fostered the creation of a lot of internet phenomena ,COMMA viral videos and whatnot ,COMMA known as memes .PERIOD 
and so there are three that i want to show you specifically .PERIOD 
it is where a third of all the traffic is going .PERIOD 
they got it taken offline and managed to piss off part of the internet .PERIOD 
so we've got this activist group that's this grassroots group that's come out of the site .PERIOD 
dusty is the name that we've given to this cat .PERIOD 
we're sacrificing a lot of that ,COMMA and i think in doing so ,COMMA moving towards those things ,COMMA we're losing something valuable .PERIOD 
you're lucky that this is not being streamed to them live right now .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA you never know .PERIOD some of them - we've got people in <NUM> countries out there watching .PERIOD 
don't tell .PERIOD 
and saying whatever you like ,COMMA i think ,COMMA is powerful .PERIOD 
and the thing is ,COMMA i didn't make it into that presentation because i can't read to you anything that they said ,COMMA more or less .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA well .PERIOD 
you've got this surprising semi-underground influence ,COMMA but it's not making you a lot of money ,COMMA yet .PERIOD 
yeah .PERIOD they still didn't know what to think of that though .PERIOD 
within five ,COMMA <NUM> million years of the bolide impact we had a whole variety of animals going into the water .PERIOD why didn't they do that ?QUESTIONMARK 
you want to measure it by diversity ?QUESTIONMARK 
this slide was shown before .PERIOD this is the famous jurassic bird archaeopteryx .PERIOD 
if we could roll that first video clip .PERIOD 
but one with an immense chalkboard in the middle ,COMMA with lots of little areas of dinosaur rock if you could survive an expedition .PERIOD 
and the kinds of teams they bring in ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA you are finding yourself also in an amazing cultural milieu .PERIOD 
you're really rubbing shoulders with the world's last great nomadic people .PERIOD 
here's the animal that was causing it trouble .PERIOD 
it is an incredible view of life ,COMMA and it really began when we began to understand the depth of time .PERIOD 
we prototyped by cat-scanning the brain out of this animal .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA this field is just - and ,COMMA of course ,COMMA science in general - is just - adventure .PERIOD 
narrator :COLON if they can just land it ,COMMA this croc will provide useful data ,COMMA helping paul in his quest to understand sarcosuchus .PERIOD 
i've got it .PERIOD i've got the back legs .PERIOD 
paul sereno :COLON let's get this tape measure on him .PERIOD put it right there .PERIOD 
wow .PERIOD 
anyway ,COMMA you find other things ,COMMA too .PERIOD 
these are all landlubbing animals .PERIOD there's a couple of choices .PERIOD 
and you take those four instances and you realize you have a complex problem .PERIOD 
they did it within two or three degrees of the pole ,COMMA to maintain similarity between continents .PERIOD 
now we have divergence over time ,COMMA but we've created the third dimension of area .PERIOD 
i was a total failure in school ,COMMA not really headed to graduate high school .PERIOD 
what about all the kids like me that were in school - kids like some of you out there - that were in school and didn't get a chance and will never get a chance to participate in science and technology ?QUESTIONMARK 
because when you go out there as a scholar ,COMMA and you try to find out longitudinal studies ,COMMA track records like that ,COMMA there essentially are very few ,COMMA if none .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
and as a little girl ,COMMA i loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us much more like a helpful ,COMMA trusted sidekick - something that would delight us ,COMMA enrich our lives and help us save a galaxy or two .PERIOD 
i almost lost it this week .PERIOD 
leo ,COMMA this is cookie monster .PERIOD 
we looked at psychological involvement - how much empathy did you feel for the other person ?QUESTIONMARK 
we looked at their desire to cooperate .PERIOD 
today we know that families are living further and further apart ,COMMA and that definitely takes a toll on family relationships and family bonds over distance .PERIOD 
and as grandma-bot ,COMMA she can now play ,COMMA really play ,COMMA with my sons ,COMMA with her grandsons ,COMMA in the real world with his real toys .PERIOD 
another was a computer that ran the same touch-screen interface ,COMMA ran exactly the same dialogues .PERIOD 
the quality of advice was identical .PERIOD 
we've invited a lot of kids into this space ,COMMA and they think it's pretty cool .PERIOD 
that's her competition .PERIOD 
paula radcliffe ,COMMA the one person who is sure to snatch the big paycheck out of derartu tulu's under-underdog hands ,COMMA suddenly grabs her leg and starts to fall back .PERIOD 
they're not doing <NUM> miles ;SEMICOLON they're doing <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> miles at a time ,COMMA and apparently without injury ,COMMA without problems .PERIOD 
and if you know it ,COMMA then you are smarter than anybody else on planet earth .PERIOD 
australopithecus had a tiny little pea brain .PERIOD 
the only problem is ,COMMA the first edged weapons only appeared about <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
we're not fast .PERIOD 
her uterus would be torn .PERIOD 
then you go beyond <NUM> miles ,COMMA into the distance that medical science also told us would be fatal to humans - remember pheidippides died when he ran <NUM> miles - you get to <NUM> and <NUM> miles ,COMMA and suddenly it's a different game .PERIOD 
well emily baer - <NUM> runners - she finishes in eighth place ,COMMA in the top <NUM> ,COMMA even though she stopped at all the aid stations to breastfeed her baby during the race - and yet ,COMMA beat <NUM> other people .PERIOD 
and you'll get slower and slower ,COMMA until eventually you're back to running the same speed you were at age <NUM> .PERIOD 
now i defy you to come up with any other physical activity - and please don't say golf - something that actually is hard - where geriatrics are performing as well as they did as teenagers .PERIOD 
maybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal .PERIOD 
well if that's true ,COMMA a couple other things had to be true as well .PERIOD 
the key to being part of a hunting pack is the word pack .PERIOD 
you need to have those 27-year-old studs at the peak of their powers ready to drop the kill ,COMMA and you need to have those teenagers there who are learning the whole thing all involved .PERIOD 
you can't be hauling all your crap around ,COMMA trying to chase the antelope .PERIOD 
he pissed me off .PERIOD let him go chase his own antelope .PERIOD 
geronimo used to say that ,COMMA my only friends are my legs .PERIOD i only trust my legs .PERIOD 
that's because an apache triathlon used to be you'd run <NUM> miles across the desert ,COMMA engage in hand-to-hand combat ,COMMA steal a bunch of horses and slap leather for home .PERIOD 
i didn't do yoga .PERIOD i'm not ready .PERIOD 
so hopefully it's something we can all benefit from .PERIOD 
i show a number of photographs and films ,COMMA but i also make television programs ,COMMA books and some advertising ,COMMA all with the same concept .PERIOD 
i was fascinated by this phenomenon ,COMMA so i wondered :COLON could one erase the image of diana ,COMMA actually quite crudely and physically ?QUESTIONMARK 
momentum was being built .PERIOD 
i then went on wondering whether i could actually replace her image ,COMMA so i got a look-alike of diana and posed her in the right positions and angles and created something that was in ,COMMA or existed in ,COMMA the public imagination .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this is an image of diana looking at camilla kissing her husband ,COMMA and this was a sequence of images .PERIOD 
all this imagery was creating a lot of fuss and i was cited as a disgusting artist .PERIOD the press were writing about this ,COMMA giving full pages about how terrible this was .PERIOD 
but then this changed suddenly .PERIOD 
i was sitting next to someone at dinner the other day ,COMMA and they were saying there's this great image of the queen sitting outside william hill .PERIOD 
i explored with actually dressing up as the celebrities myself .PERIOD 
and me as the queen .PERIOD 
i then continued on to make a whole body of work about marilyn - the biggest icon of all - and trying to titillate by shooting through doorways and shutters and so on and so forth ,COMMA and only showing certain angles to create a reality that ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA is completely constructed .PERIOD 
i did an advertising campaign for schweppes ,COMMA which is coca-cola ,COMMA and so that was very interesting in terms of the legalities .PERIOD 
tony blair and cherie .PERIOD and again ,COMMA the legalities - we had to be very careful .PERIOD 
and the press were interviewing ,COMMA and i was signing my book .PERIOD .PERIOD 
and in fact ,COMMA george bush and tony blair are having great fun during all of this .PERIOD 
so there was a lot of meaning in my life because i was performing this type of research during the day .PERIOD 
my left hemisphere - our left hemisphere - is a very different place .PERIOD 
our left hemisphere is all about the past and it's all about the future .PERIOD 
it's that ongoing brain chatter that connects me and my internal world to my external world .PERIOD 
i become a single solid individual ,COMMA separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you .PERIOD 
and i looked down at my body and i thought ,COMMA whoa ,COMMA i'm a weird-looking thing .PERIOD and it was as though my consciousness had shifted away from my normal perception of reality ,COMMA where i'm the person on the machine having the experience ,COMMA to some esoteric space where i'm witnessing myself having this experience .PERIOD 
i can't define where i begin and where i end ,COMMA because the atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall .PERIOD 
and then i would wait for what i call a wave of clarity .PERIOD 
and so i say to him - clear in my mind ,COMMA i say to him :COLON this is jill !EXCLAMATIONMARK i need help !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
nirvana .PERIOD i found nirvana .PERIOD and i remember thinking ,COMMA there's no way i would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body .PERIOD 
two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage ,COMMA the surgeons went in and they removed a blood clot the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers .PERIOD 
i believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep inner-peace circuitry of our right hemispheres ,COMMA the more peace we will project into the world ,COMMA and the more peaceful our planet will be .PERIOD 
in africa - where it is a major killer - it is totally ignored .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA you will die .PERIOD <NUM> percent will die within <NUM> hours ,COMMA if not treated .PERIOD 
if you cannot secure the parents ,COMMA you cannot guarantee the security of the african child .PERIOD 
these are just for information :COLON hypertension ,COMMA diabetes ,COMMA obesity ,COMMA lack of exercise .PERIOD the usual suspects .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA they spend their money trying to fix those problems .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA for a radiopharmaceutical in the u.s. - that you'll get a unit dose for <NUM> dollars - when we're finished manufacturing it in-house ,COMMA we come at a price of about two dollars .PERIOD 
this is at the heart institute .PERIOD the doctors from anywhere can log in .PERIOD 
they'll give me that information ,COMMA and we'll make the care of the patient better .PERIOD 
because if you can't get it in nashville ,COMMA you can travel to birmingham ,COMMA two hours away ,COMMA and you'll get it .PERIOD if you can't get it in cleveland ,COMMA you can go to cincinnati .PERIOD we don't have that luxury ,COMMA so we have to make it happen .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we emphasize training .PERIOD training is critical .PERIOD 
sharon lazarus :COLON i am an echocardiographer at the heart institute of the caribbean ,COMMA since the past two years .PERIOD i received training at this institution .PERIOD 
i think i'll start out and just talk a little bit about what exactly autism is .PERIOD 
i'm really concerned that a lot of the schools have taken out the hands-on classes ,COMMA because art ,COMMA and classes like that ,COMMA those are the classes where i excelled .PERIOD 
i thought everybody thought in pictures .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA there is my childhood church ,COMMA that's specific .PERIOD there's some more ,COMMA fort collins .PERIOD 
but one of the things that really worries me is :COLON where's the younger version of those kids going today ?QUESTIONMARK 
and then there's a verbal mind ,COMMA they know every fact about everything .PERIOD 
and i came in half an hour beforehand so i could have it put on and kind of get used to it ,COMMA and they got it bent so it's not hitting my chin .PERIOD 
because think about it :COLON an animal is a sensory-based thinker ,COMMA not verbal - thinks in pictures ,COMMA thinks in sounds ,COMMA thinks in smells .PERIOD 
are they friend or foe ?QUESTIONMARK is there anybody he can go mate with ?QUESTIONMARK 
there's a ton of information on that fire hydrant .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA this ability to put information into categories ,COMMA i find a lot of people are not very good at this .PERIOD 
i find a lot of people have difficulty doing that .PERIOD 
is it a minor problem ,COMMA with something simple i can fix ?QUESTIONMARK 
yeah ,COMMA i'm a million-mile flyer .PERIOD 
i do lots and lots of flying ,COMMA and if i was at the faa ,COMMA what would i be doing a lot of direct observation of ?QUESTIONMARK 
it would be their airplane tails .PERIOD 
i was a goofball student .PERIOD when i was in high school i just didn't care at all about studying ,COMMA until i had mr. carlock's science class .PERIOD 
and they're not going down the right path .PERIOD 
but you know what ?QUESTIONMARK i was getting work experience .PERIOD 
in other words ,COMMA use that fixation in order to motivate that kid ,COMMA that's one of the things we need to do .PERIOD 
the pattern thinkers ,COMMA they're the ones that are going to be your mathematicians ,COMMA your software engineers ,COMMA your computer programmers ,COMMA all of those kinds of jobs .PERIOD 
because the thing about being autistic is ,COMMA i had to learn social skills like being in a play .PERIOD 
i cannot emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA first of all ,COMMA you've got to look at age .PERIOD 
how many cattle got poked with the prodder ?QUESTIONMARK 
temple ,COMMA can i just say it's an absolute delight to have you at ted .PERIOD 
okay .PERIOD 
bye-bye .PERIOD 
when they were a bunch of kids ,COMMA they were kind of very imaginative ,COMMA very adventurous ,COMMA as they were trying at caltech to mix chemicals and see which one blows up more .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA that's what we call our first five employees during the tea break ,COMMA you know ,COMMA in here .PERIOD 
and that was done over a period of a couple of years ,COMMA and now we are the leading organization ,COMMA you know ,COMMA exploring space on all of your behalf .PERIOD 
but even when we did that ,COMMA we had to remind ourselves ,COMMA sometimes there are setbacks .PERIOD 
but then also ,COMMA just to celebrate that ,COMMA we started an event at jpl for miss guided missile .PERIOD 
maybe they're right - i doubt it .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA next time you are really depressed ,COMMA look in the mirror and you can look and say ,COMMA hi ,COMMA i'm looking at a star here .PERIOD 
so it is a dynamic planet ,COMMA and activity is going on as we speak today .PERIOD 
as i told you ,COMMA geologists love craters .PERIOD 
if you were there you wouldn't do it yourself .PERIOD 
and that's what we found out .PERIOD it turned out that every once in a while there are dust devils which come by on mars ,COMMA as you are seeing here ,COMMA and when the dust devil comes over the rover ,COMMA it just cleans it up .PERIOD 
yeah !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
it's the first mission that's going to try to land near the north pole of mars ,COMMA and it's the first mission that's actually going to try and reach out and touch water on the surface of another planet .PERIOD 
the outside can get almost as hot as the surface of the sun .PERIOD 
the temperature of the heat shield can reach <NUM> degrees fahrenheit .PERIOD 
the fabric and the stitching could just pull apart .PERIOD 
we kick them ,COMMA we hit them ,COMMA we drop them ,COMMA just to make sure we understand how ,COMMA where would they break .PERIOD 
and i know many of you ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA last time afterwards said well ,COMMA that was a cool thing to have - those airbags .PERIOD 
it's real stuff .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA the idea is ,COMMA by watching saturn we're actually watching our solar system in real time being formed on a smaller scale ,COMMA so it's like a test bed for it .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA you think that those rings are very large objects .PERIOD 
so people believe now that titan is most likely what we call a pre-biotic planet ,COMMA because it's so cold organic material did not get to the stage of becoming biological material ,COMMA and therefore life could have evolved on it .PERIOD 
so here we have a cycle of a planet which is like our earth ,COMMA but is all made of ethane and methane and organic material .PERIOD 
and being the current day ,COMMA of course ,COMMA we started our own facebook group .PERIOD 
now why am i telling you this story ,COMMA and what does this have to do with the future of health ?QUESTIONMARK 
what i'd like to talk about today is understanding these exponential technologies .PERIOD 
and coming up next month is actually future med ,COMMA a program to help cross-train and leverage technologies into medicine .PERIOD 
these mobile phones have over <NUM> different mobile apps available - to the point where there's one out of the u.k .PERIOD 
let's start with faster .PERIOD 
we can look inside with real time fmri - in the brain at real time .PERIOD 
the scan in a couple of years will be one terabyte ,COMMA or <NUM> books .PERIOD 
and now ,COMMA of course ,COMMA we're in the era of the ipad ,COMMA even the ipad <NUM> .PERIOD 
the ability to interact with your health care provider is different .PERIOD 
consumers now can buy basically hundred-dollar devices ,COMMA like this little fitbit .PERIOD 
so a few examples :COLON we're now in the era of fantastic voyage ,COMMA the ipill .PERIOD 
and this is really going to leverage technology to the rural and the under-served and enable what used to be thousand-dollar tests to be done at pennies and at the point of care .PERIOD 
my data indicates that i've got about average risk for developing macular degeneration ,COMMA a kind of blindness .PERIOD 
i'm at almost twice the risk for type ii diabetes .PERIOD 
it might change my behavior .PERIOD 
we can capture that information .PERIOD 
this has been called by lee hood ,COMMA the father of the field ,COMMA <NUM> medicine .PERIOD 
how about more targeted therapies for cancer ?QUESTIONMARK 
now i'll close with regenerative medicine .PERIOD 
geron ,COMMA just last year ,COMMA started the first trial using human embryonic stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries .PERIOD 
still a phase i trial ,COMMA but evolving .PERIOD 
i thought i would read poems i have that relate to the subject of youth and age .PERIOD 
my grandmother is washing my mouth out with soap ;SEMICOLON half a long century gone and still she comes at me with that thick cruel yellow bar .PERIOD 
it's a longer poem .PERIOD 
it's called the neighbor .PERIOD 
her shadow once ,COMMA fumbling the chain on her door ,COMMA then the door slamming fearfully shut ,COMMA only the barking and the music - jazz - filtering as it does ,COMMA day and night into the hall .PERIOD 
my thinking we'd meet ,COMMA recognize one another ,COMMA become friends ,COMMA that i'd accomplish a penance .PERIOD 
sometimes there are frightening goings-on in the stairwell .PERIOD 
medea she was ,COMMA next time i saw her .PERIOD 
my holding the door .PERIOD 
instead ,COMMA i'd step into my train .PERIOD 
the dance of our glances ,COMMA the clash ,COMMA pulling each other through our perceptual punctures ,COMMA then holocaust ,COMMA holocaust ,COMMA host on host of ill ,COMMA injured presences ,COMMA squandered ,COMMA consumed .PERIOD 
the dance of our glances ,COMMA challenge ,COMMA abdication ,COMMA effacement ,COMMA the perfume of our consternation .PERIOD 
forever .PERIOD with grace .PERIOD 
but i'm afraid that ricky will come out here and shake his fist at me .PERIOD 
special :COLON big tits ,COMMA says the advertisement for a soft-core magazine on our neighborhood newsstand .PERIOD 
but forget her breasts .PERIOD 
the display was a photo .PERIOD men and women stripped naked ,COMMA some trying to cover their genitals ,COMMA others too frightened to bother ,COMMA lined up in snow waiting to be shot and thrown into a ditch .PERIOD 
what carnal mistrust had their teacher taught them .PERIOD 
the truth is that we know that the images themselves don't change the world ,COMMA but we're also aware that ,COMMA since the beginning of photography ,COMMA images have provoked reactions in people ,COMMA and those reactions have caused change to happen .PERIOD 
it changed our view of the physical world .PERIOD 
some would argue that it is those images that did more to fuel the insurgency in iraq than virtually any other single act .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA these images became the voices of protest themselves .PERIOD 
i was the only human being in an area one-and-a-half times the size of america ,COMMA five-and-a-half thousand square miles .PERIOD 
ben ,COMMA i've read somewhere that at minus <NUM> ,COMMA exposed skin becomes frostbitten in less than a minute ,COMMA so how do you answer the call of nature ?QUESTIONMARK 
third one :COLON how do you top that ?QUESTIONMARK what's next ?QUESTIONMARK 
i was <NUM> years old .PERIOD no one my age had attempted anything like this ,COMMA and pretty quickly ,COMMA almost everything that could have gone wrong did go wrong .PERIOD 
i had frostbite in my left big toe .PERIOD 
you can just see - there's a nine and a string of zeros here .PERIOD 
i dialed three numbers .PERIOD i dialed my mum .PERIOD 
the - the whole world underneath me .PERIOD 
there are huge areas of open water just south of your position .PERIOD 
antarctica ,COMMA if you include the ice shelves ,COMMA is twice the size of australia - it's a big place .PERIOD 
and they turned around ,COMMA headed back to the coast ,COMMA and all five of them died on the return journey .PERIOD 
where was this guilt trip coming from ?QUESTIONMARK 
there was one person in the group that was supposed to have very high performance that was actually performing terribly .PERIOD 
and he pulled the whole mean down ,COMMA destroying my statistical significance of the test .PERIOD 
so i looked carefully at this guy .PERIOD 
and i'm sure that it's something that we all recognize ,COMMA and we see that it happens .PERIOD 
and that's a much ,COMMA much more difficult lesson to take into account .PERIOD 
in my mind ,COMMA i was actually a knight trying to help science move along .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA this is all very depressing ,COMMA right - people have conflicts of interest ,COMMA we don't see it ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD 
this is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist who's been in field of hiv for <NUM> years ,COMMA worked on four continents ,COMMA and you're looking at her .PERIOD 
and so everyone lined up ,COMMA all the smackheads in a row ,COMMA and the guy whose birthday it was filled up the fit ,COMMA and he went down and started injecting people .PERIOD 
so his choice was either to accept that dirty needle or not to get high .PERIOD 
so what's that about ?QUESTIONMARK is it like you get a better high if you share or something ?QUESTIONMARK 
so she was making a politically rational decision .PERIOD 
i've always been a bit curious about that because i think stigma is a bad thing ,COMMA whereas lots of sex is quite a good thing ,COMMA but we'll leave that be .PERIOD 
of course ,COMMA you can't get hiv just by having unprotected sex .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA again ,COMMA it's because of an alignment of the incentives .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA actually ,COMMA clients don't want to go home with a drip either .PERIOD 
he's from haiti and he has aids .PERIOD 
and the other thing is that people are simply not as scared of hiv as they were of aids ,COMMA and rightly so .PERIOD 
we've got the tools ,COMMA the knowledge and the cash ,COMMA and commitment to preventing hiv too .PERIOD 
there are as many different ways of being rational as there are human beings on the planet ,COMMA and that's one of the glories of human existence .PERIOD 
ten years ago exactly ,COMMA i was in afghanistan .PERIOD 
would you like to see civil war ,COMMA sectarian killing ?QUESTIONMARK 
they found something called facebook .PERIOD 
this is what they were telling .PERIOD this is their propaganda .PERIOD 
and this is how the revolution was born in tunisia .PERIOD 
but we found that these people in the street ,COMMA all of them are our reporters ,COMMA feeding our newsroom with pictures ,COMMA with videos and with news .PERIOD 
we are going to be the voice for these voiceless people .PERIOD 
they have been detached from their people ,COMMA from the masses ,COMMA and now we are seeing them collapsing one after the other .PERIOD 
i felt the responsibility to phone our correspondents there and to phone our newsroom and to tell them ,COMMA make your best not to switch off the cameras at night ,COMMA because the guys there really feel confident when someone is reporting their story - and they feel protected as well .PERIOD 
we have a chance to go and to think of the future as something which is open to the world .PERIOD 
let us free ourselves - especially in the west - from thinking about that part of the world based on oil interest ,COMMA or based on interests of the illusion of stability and security .PERIOD 
is this a story-of-the-year ,COMMA a story-of-the-decade or something more ?QUESTIONMARK 
in my opinion ,COMMA these people are much more wiser than ,COMMA not only the political elite ,COMMA even the intellectual elite ,COMMA even opposition leaders including political parties .PERIOD 
thank you so much .PERIOD 
and i'm going to have michael manring play bass with me .PERIOD 
she got mad ;SEMICOLON i took a licking .PERIOD 
hey ,COMMA hey ,COMMA hey ,COMMA hey .PERIOD hey ,COMMA hey ,COMMA black-eyed susie ,COMMA hey !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
one more time now .PERIOD 
i fell in love with that .PERIOD 
the old jack tales that he had learned - he talked like this ,COMMA you could hardly understand him .PERIOD but it was really wonderful .PERIOD 
it was hard on the cats ,COMMA but it made a great little instrument .PERIOD 
and if you don't know what you're doing ,COMMA your hands are bleeding in no time .PERIOD 
good news :COLON chariot's coming .PERIOD 
and i don't want it to leave me behind .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA my mother hoped that we learned from that the value of hard work .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA we learned something else .PERIOD 
the first thing i learned that day was that i never ever wanted to work that hard again .PERIOD 
but that day in the cotton field out there picking ,COMMA when those people started singing ,COMMA i realized i was in the very heart of real music ,COMMA and that's where i've wanted to be ever since .PERIOD 
good news :COLON chariot's coming .PERIOD 
it was a few years ago ,COMMA but i sort of remembered this story ,COMMA and i told it at a concert .PERIOD 
my mom was in the audience .PERIOD 
i just wanted you boys to learn the value of hard work .PERIOD 
and i don't want it to leave me behind .PERIOD 
i just break off another bottleneck and play these steel guitar blues .PERIOD 
they were about my age .PERIOD 
it had three chemicals we were really surprised to see :COLON sulfur ,COMMA potassium nitrate and charcoal .PERIOD 
we tore everything down and buried it in his backyard .PERIOD 
we have about <NUM> million dollars ,COMMA and we want to do it well .PERIOD 
the first thing that anybody who knows science ,COMMA and has been around science ,COMMA is that the stuff you learn in school as a scientific method is wrong .PERIOD there is no method .PERIOD 
i ’ m not going to read them all to you because i ’ m not in teacher mode .PERIOD 
and i want to talk about three stages in that evolution .PERIOD 
in that year ,COMMA we are not available for any of our clients .PERIOD 
we are totally closed .PERIOD 
quite the similar idea ,COMMA then ,COMMA a perfume packaged in a book ,COMMA in a die cut .PERIOD 
i likely already look forward to the weekend on thursdays .PERIOD 
europe and the u.s. didn't really feel enticing because i knew them too well .PERIOD so asia it was .PERIOD 
so i looked for furniture .PERIOD 
so one of the things that we pursued in bali was pieces of furniture .PERIOD 
and i think by the time this lamp came about ,COMMA i had finally made peace with those dogs .PERIOD 
i also started meditating for the first time in my life in bali .PERIOD 
his latest numbers are fairly impressive .PERIOD 
so i became my own intern .PERIOD 
i had fun .PERIOD 
financially ,COMMA seen over the long term ,COMMA it was actually successful .PERIOD 
we were asked to design an identity for casa da musica ,COMMA the rem koolhaas-built music center in porto ,COMMA in portugal .PERIOD 
it has a more transparent identity .PERIOD 
some of you might have seen it .PERIOD 
so after eight hours that's pretty much all that was left of the whole thing .PERIOD 
so i'll just give you my message up front :COLON try not to go extinct .PERIOD 
people ask me a lot - in fact ,COMMA one of the most asked questions i get is ,COMMA why do children like dinosaurs so much ?QUESTIONMARK 
every museum wanted a little bigger or better one than anybody else had .PERIOD 
so everyone was out looking for all these bigger and better dinosaurs .PERIOD 
and they thought about it and they even wrote papers about it :COLON where are the little dinosaurs ?QUESTIONMARK 
first off ,COMMA scientists have egos ,COMMA and scientists like to name dinosaurs .PERIOD 
so this is where people went astray again .PERIOD 
but i have a museum and i collect dinosaurs and i can saw mine open .PERIOD 
and if you cut into an older dinosaur ,COMMA it's very massive .PERIOD 
so here's a dinosaur that has spikes sticking out of its head ,COMMA no dome and gnarly stuff on its nose .PERIOD 
nobody noticed the gnarly stuff sort of looked alike .PERIOD 
dracorex is the littlest one ,COMMA stygimoloch is the middle size one ,COMMA pachycephalosaurus is the largest one .PERIOD 
but it didn't give them a clue .PERIOD 
so we have a whole bunch of them at our museum .PERIOD 
and then as they grow older ,COMMA the horns grow forward .PERIOD 
if you look along the edge of the frill ,COMMA they have these little triangular bones that actually grow big as triangles and then they flatten against the frill pretty much like the spikes do on the pachycephalosaurs .PERIOD 
and we get rid of anatotitan .PERIOD 
so again ,COMMA real easy to say that tyrannosaurus ontogeny included nanotyrannus ,COMMA and therefore we can take out another dinosaur .PERIOD 
now as you can imagine ,COMMA this is not very popular with fourth-graders .PERIOD 
this is soft sell for <NUM> street .PERIOD 
they weren't doing their primary work ,COMMA which was for the government ,COMMA while they were helping us with this .PERIOD 
and many musicians choose to use the theater glass walls totally open .PERIOD 
chamber and the notion of chamber has to do with salons and small-scale performances .PERIOD they asked us to bring an intimacy .PERIOD 
and this is a mockup that is in salt lake city that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full-scale .PERIOD 
chris has been so nice .PERIOD 
so nice ,COMMA all week .PERIOD he's the kind of man you could say to ,COMMA chris ,COMMA i'm really sorry ,COMMA i've crashed your car .PERIOD 
and you know that chris would say ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD 
emmanuel ?QUESTIONMARK absolutely .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA that's going to look pretty shabby now .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what i thought i'd do is - in honor of emmanuel - is ,COMMA what i can do is to launch today the first ted global auction .PERIOD 
and he'll say ,COMMA you're offering me things that are infinitely variable .PERIOD 
and she's desperate to find more evidence for the link .PERIOD 
this man has swum around the north pole ,COMMA what more evidence do you want ?QUESTIONMARK 
no .PERIOD 
alright ,COMMA it was never exactly'brokeback mountain .PERIOD' you know ,COMMA i wrote to him ,COMMA just before i left office .PERIOD i said ,COMMA'can i rely on your support for the next month ?QUESTIONMARK' and he wrote back .PERIOD he said ,COMMA'no ,COMMA you can't .PERIOD' which kind of surprised me ,COMMA because i'd never seen'can't' spelled that way before .PERIOD 
when you think what's happened to financial services ,COMMA and you see what's happened to the economy ,COMMA you think ,COMMA well ,COMMA there is a man who delivers on his promises .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA iceland ,COMMA it was never going to cut it .PERIOD 
luckily ,COMMA somebody like george bush was really helpful .PERIOD 
he summed it up ,COMMA really ,COMMA at a dinner .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA you're now ,COMMA well ,COMMA actually ,COMMA that's what this is about .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA you know i'm sorry about that .PERIOD 
and you want a leader who inspires and challenges and makes you want to be a better citizen .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK 
so he comes over to this country ,COMMA and he says ,COMMA we need a big fiscal stimulus .PERIOD 
he goes to prague ,COMMA he says ,COMMA we believe in a nuclear-free world .PERIOD 
do you remember that ?QUESTIONMARK george bush ,COMMA a nu-ca-ler .PERIOD 
.PERIOD who said ,COMMA reach out and touch .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA nelson ,COMMA how would you like a nice water feature ?QUESTIONMARK

our studies have found that there is a <NUM> percent probability of one's blood oxygen going up by one percent if one stays indoors in this building for <NUM> hours .PERIOD

why is this important ?QUESTIONMARK 
so how do you feel about that - the whole - ma :COLON well ,COMMA it's pretty irritating actually because nobody ever describes what a man is wearing .PERIOD 
and no guy ever gets criticized .PERIOD but that's the least of it .PERIOD 
how did you handle that balance between being the tough diplomatic and strong voice of this country to the rest of the world and also how you felt about yourself as a mother ,COMMA a grandmother ,COMMA nurturing .PERIOD 
and so how did you handle that ?QUESTIONMARK 
because in her lifetime - ma :COLON that would be so .PERIOD 
thank you for joining us today .PERIOD 
my little group of molecular programmers are trying to refashion all of these parts from dna .PERIOD 
and if you buy all of this ,COMMA and you think life is about computation ,COMMA as i do ,COMMA then you look at big questions through the eyes of a computer scientist .PERIOD 
this is exactly analogous to the question ,COMMA what's the smallest program i can write that will act exactly like microsoft word ?QUESTIONMARK 
and just as he's writing ,COMMA you know ,COMMA bacteria that will be smaller ,COMMA he's writing genomes that will work ,COMMA we could write smaller programs that would do what microsoft word does .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA these are big questions in computer science .PERIOD 
that holds the long strand like this .PERIOD 
i wanted to fold dna into something that goes up over the eye ,COMMA down the nose ,COMMA up the nose ,COMMA around the forehead ,COMMA back down and end in a little loop like this .PERIOD 
it's got a needle ,COMMA like a record needle ,COMMA that goes back and forth over the surface ,COMMA bumps up and down ,COMMA and feels the height of the first surface .PERIOD 
she wrote all her own software to design and built this dna origami ,COMMA a beautiful rendition of china ,COMMA which even has taiwan ,COMMA and you can see it's sort of on the world's shortest leash ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
now ,COMMA this is just a single switch and you need half a billion for a computer ,COMMA so we have a long way to go .PERIOD 
the dna origami is a proof that that compiler actually works .PERIOD 
the fact is that it does not scale .PERIOD 
so now ,COMMA we can use this counting to try and get at much bigger things than dna origami could otherwise .PERIOD 
you can just change a couple of the dna strands in this binary representation and you'll get <NUM> rather than <NUM> .PERIOD 
here is a dna origami rectangle ,COMMA and here are some tiles growing from it .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it turns out we actually had this idea nine years ago ,COMMA and that's about the time constant for how long it takes to do these kinds of things ,COMMA so i think we made a lot of progress .PERIOD 
we've got ideas about how to fix these errors .PERIOD 
what it's really about is taking computer science and looking at big questions in a new light ,COMMA asking new versions of those big questions and trying to understand how biology can make such amazing things .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD 
therefore ,COMMA it would be too risky to release these animals ,COMMA both for the released and for the natural populations .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this is not new ,COMMA people have been doing this around the world .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA these genes are indeed going back to the populations .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i say ,COMMA let's study more ,COMMA let's shed light on this issue ,COMMA let's do whatever we can .PERIOD 
this song kind of came out of all of that .PERIOD 
we ended up being the first medical response team in every incident location and transported <NUM> victims ,COMMA saving life .PERIOD 
and the other is moksha-yug access ,COMMA which is integrating rural supply chain on the foundations of self-help group-based microfinance .PERIOD 
now i come back to the idea of the new social enterprise that i'm exploring .PERIOD 
often it is the constraining or the back-to-the-wall situation that the hapless common man finds himself or herself in that leads him to pay a bribe .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA let me ask you another question .PERIOD 
but you also don't have the time ,COMMA resources ,COMMA expertise or wherewithal to fight this .PERIOD 
like a bribe buster service ,COMMA or 1-800-fight-bribes ,COMMA or www.stopbribes.org or www.preventcorruption.org .PERIOD 
i don't want to be haunted by such images any more .PERIOD 
a set of people actually say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA let me just grant it to them ,COMMA and run away from it .PERIOD 
but the one thing i want you to notice about them is this :COLON even though this is a very long list ,COMMA there isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings .PERIOD 
and yet ,COMMA when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like ,COMMA they encountered mike ,COMMA who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor because mr. jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise ,COMMA trying to build up his strength ,COMMA walking slowly up and down the hall .PERIOD 
and then there was luke ,COMMA who washed the floor in a comatose young man's room twice because the man's father ,COMMA who had been keeping a vigil for six months ,COMMA didn't see luke do it the first time ,COMMA and his father was angry .PERIOD 
a wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule ,COMMA as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives .PERIOD 
a wise person is like a jazz musician - using the notes on the page ,COMMA but dancing around them ,COMMA inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand .PERIOD 
a wise person knows how to use these moral skills in the service of the right aims .PERIOD 
dad ,COMMA being an academic ,COMMA had no idea that mike's hard lemonade contained alcohol .PERIOD 
and they were ready to let the kid go .PERIOD 
when things go wrong ,COMMA as of course they do ,COMMA we reach for two tools to try to fix them .PERIOD 
say <NUM> items in this script to teach a 25-page picture book .PERIOD 
scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster .PERIOD 
jazz musicians need some notes - most of them need some notes on the page .PERIOD 
we need more rules for the bankers ,COMMA god knows .PERIOD 
some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed .PERIOD 
they said ,COMMA if we paid you six weeks' salary every year would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community ?QUESTIONMARK 
we see this in medicine .PERIOD 
i don't know how many of you remember this :COLON another moral hero ,COMMA <NUM> years ago ,COMMA aaron feuerstein ,COMMA who was the head of malden mills in massachusetts - they made polartec - the factory burned down .PERIOD 
and a bonus he's discovering is he's actually going to make even more money .PERIOD 
in many ways this is the perfect example .PERIOD 
so there's a lot here at ted ,COMMA and at other places ,COMMA to celebrate .PERIOD 
there are ordinary heroes .PERIOD 
even the wisest and most well-meaning people will give up if they have to swim against the current in the organizations in which they work .PERIOD 
and any moral work depends upon practical wisdom .PERIOD 
i think there is reason for hope .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
a few years ago i was visited by the guy that runs darpa ,COMMA the people that fund all the advanced technologies that businesses and universities probably wouldn't take the risk of doing .PERIOD 
now we've got <NUM> and <NUM> ,COMMA and if somebody loses an arm ,COMMA we give them a plastic stick with a hook on it .PERIOD 
if it's the raisin ,COMMA they won't drop it .PERIOD 
i told them they're nuts .PERIOD 
it will take the other nine to make it functional and useful .PERIOD 
i went back and i started putting a team together ,COMMA the best guys i could find with a passion to do this .PERIOD 
we walked into walter reed and i could not have been more wrong .PERIOD 
i can give you fast control with low reduction ratios in these gears ,COMMA or i can give you power ;SEMICOLON i can't give you both .PERIOD 
i lost my right arm ,COMMA but i'm a lefty .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we went back .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we went back ,COMMA and we've been working harder yet .PERIOD 
and he was there ,COMMA and they said we needed to come .PERIOD 
he's got no arms .PERIOD 
who is going to pay for it ?QUESTIONMARK 
those are tough questions .PERIOD 
i don't know the answers .PERIOD 
what do we need to do ?QUESTIONMARK there's very polarized answers to that question too ,COMMA and i don't have any answers to that .PERIOD 
i think eventually we'll make these things extraordinary .PERIOD 
and whining and complaining about what our foreign policy ought to be .PERIOD 
and we ought to give it to them .PERIOD 
that one was way more difficult than i had expected .PERIOD 
when the rescue workers came they resuscitated him and there was no brain damage .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i took that as a challenge ,COMMA basically .PERIOD 
and i stayed inside of that water tank hoping my core temperature would start to drop .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i realized that was completely not going to work .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i went to talk to a doctor friend ,COMMA and i asked him how could i do that ?QUESTIONMARK 
then i actually started thinking about liquid breathing .PERIOD 
you blow in and out .PERIOD 
and you're really ridding your body of co2 .PERIOD 
and his total lung capacity is twice the size of an average person .PERIOD 
i had to drop <NUM> pounds in three months .PERIOD 
every bit of food was exactly what it was for its nutritional value .PERIOD 
and i started to really adapt my body .PERIOD 
i assumed that i could put a water tank at lincoln center and if i stayed there a week not eating ,COMMA i would get comfortable in that situation and i would slow my metabolism ,COMMA which i was sure would help me hold my breath longer than i had been able to do it .PERIOD 
and i thought everything seemed to be on track .PERIOD 
and by seven minutes i had gone into these awful convulsions .PERIOD 
this was a different record .PERIOD this was a pure <NUM> static apnea record that guinness had set the world record at <NUM> minutes .PERIOD 
a hypoxic tent is a tent that simulates altitude at <NUM> feet .PERIOD 
but for tv they wanted me to be upright so they could see my face ,COMMA basically .PERIOD 
that made me extremely nervous ,COMMA raising the heart rate .PERIOD 
and there is no way to slow my heart rate down .PERIOD 
and i started having ischemia to the heart .PERIOD 
my heartbeat would go from <NUM> ,COMMA to <NUM> ,COMMA to <NUM> ,COMMA to <NUM> ,COMMA to <NUM> ,COMMA to <NUM> again .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i let my feet out ,COMMA and i started floating to the top .PERIOD 
they had doctors with the pst ,COMMA you know ,COMMA so ,COMMA sitting there waiting .PERIOD 
as a magician i try to show things to people that seem impossible .PERIOD 
and then he stopped .PERIOD walking in front of him was her .PERIOD 
sure ,COMMA she had aged a little .PERIOD 
gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically while she filmed him ,COMMA because she was a keen amateur pornographer .PERIOD 
and that provides the ground for a type of action ,COMMA because consensus of each moment allows us to act .PERIOD 
we have three critical terms :COLON economy ,COMMA civil society and the state .PERIOD 
we propose <NUM> .PERIOD 
the least important form of capital ,COMMA in this project ,COMMA is financial capital - money .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the issue that should concern us here - and that's the challenge that i would like to pose to this group - is again ,COMMA it takes <NUM> years in your countries to produce somebody with a b.s .PERIOD degree .PERIOD 
every conceivable form of infrastructure had broken down .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA when violence erupts in a country like afghanistan ,COMMA it's because of that legacy .PERIOD 
look ,COMMA there's a very little known fact :COLON countries that have a legal average income per capita of <NUM> dollars don't produce drugs .PERIOD 
cotton does not compete with opium ;SEMICOLON a t-shirt does .PERIOD 
i'm all for it ;SEMICOLON after all ,COMMA i raised a lot of it .PERIOD 
and then i'll let you in on a secret ,COMMA which is why i am an incurable optimist .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA it's been calculated a few degrees' rise in the earth's temperature would melt the polar ice caps .PERIOD 
and the trends for those who are at the periphery of our society ,COMMA who are the poorest and the most vulnerable ,COMMA the trends give rise to a great case for pessimism .PERIOD 
it will cause rising seas .PERIOD it will cause saline deposited into wells and into lands .PERIOD 
for some ,COMMA it will lead to anger ,COMMA religious and sectarian violence and terrorism .PERIOD 
a minimum of <NUM> to <NUM> inches of increase in sea levels is the best case that we can hope for ,COMMA and it could be <NUM> times that .PERIOD 
enough of the bad news .PERIOD human beings have always risen to the challenge .PERIOD 
<NUM> years ago ,COMMA there were three and a half million .PERIOD 
this disease is called sudden wealth syndrome .PERIOD 
all throughout the technology world ,COMMA we're seeing young people bitten by this disease of sudden wealth syndrome .PERIOD 
more reasons to be optimistic :COLON in the <NUM> ,COMMA and i am a creature of the <NUM> ,COMMA there was a movement .PERIOD 
and on july 7th ,COMMA around the world ,COMMA i learned only yesterday ,COMMA there will be global live earth concerts .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA that doesn't mean that people understand that global warming hurts the poorest and the weakest the most .PERIOD 
we visited every house in india ,COMMA searching for smallpox - <NUM> million houses ,COMMA once every month ,COMMA for nearly two years .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
in the history of our planet ,COMMA there have been three great waves of evolution .PERIOD 
but we had to do it the hard way in the old days by choosing offspring that looked a particular way and then breeding them .PERIOD 
the scientists that made this cute little creature ended up slaughtering it and eating it afterwards .PERIOD 
a cama is a camel-llama hybrid ,COMMA created to try to get the hardiness of a camel with some of the personality traits of a llama .PERIOD 
they did it with puppies .PERIOD 
and so some states have decided to allow them ,COMMA some states have decided to ban them .PERIOD 
and before you get too worried about it ,COMMA here in the united states ,COMMA the majority of food you buy in the supermarket already has genetically-modified components to it .PERIOD 
this is prometea ,COMMA the first cloned horse .PERIOD 
these were the first cloned calves ,COMMA the first cloned grey wolves ,COMMA and then ,COMMA finally ,COMMA the first cloned piglets :COLON alexis ,COMMA chista ,COMMA carrel ,COMMA janie and dotcom .PERIOD 
this is the use of animals now to create drugs and other things in their bodies that we want to create .PERIOD 
these are two creatures that were created in order to save endangered species .PERIOD 
and now ,COMMA using a joystick ,COMMA they can send this creature around the lab and control whether it goes left or right ,COMMA forwards or backwards .PERIOD 
we've taken away the autonomy of this animal .PERIOD 
and he used that as the it piece of a mechanism which ran a flight simulator .PERIOD 
i don't know ,COMMA but in fact it is a fully living brain that we have managed to keep alive to do our bidding .PERIOD 
this is a mouse created by charles vacanti of the university of massachusetts .PERIOD 
this is what frankenstein's lab looks like .PERIOD 
we are not only already using these things in animals ,COMMA some of them we're already beginning to use on our own bodies .PERIOD 
he was raised by very supportive and interested parents .PERIOD 
and the observations that he made on that epic journey were to be eventually distilled into his wonderful book ,COMMA on the origin of species ,COMMA published <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
now what is so interesting and to some ,COMMA the extent ,COMMA what's a bit infamous about the origin of species ,COMMA is that there is only one line in it about human evolution .PERIOD 
if only darwin had nasa .PERIOD 
this has tremendous implications for our understanding of the evolution of human skin pigmentation .PERIOD 
and that skin pigmentation itself was a product of evolution .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA living at the equator ,COMMA we got lots and lots of ultraviolet radiation and the melanin - this wonderful ,COMMA complex ,COMMA ancient polymer compound in our skin - served as a superb natural sunscreen .PERIOD 
major moves ,COMMA outside of our equatorial homeland ,COMMA from africa into other parts of the old world ,COMMA and most recently ,COMMA into the new world .PERIOD 
but it's all uva ,COMMA and ,COMMA significantly ,COMMA that uva has no ability to make vitamin d in your skin .PERIOD 
humans have been on the move for a long time .PERIOD 
here are just some of the biggest movements of people ,COMMA voluntary movements ,COMMA in the last <NUM> years .PERIOD 
and not all these moves were voluntary .PERIOD 
evolution helps us .PERIOD 
but we need to think about how he compares ,COMMA in terms of his pigmentation ,COMMA to other people on earth .PERIOD 
they also run the risk of vitamin d deficiency ,COMMA if they have desk jobs ,COMMA like that guy .PERIOD 
darwin ,COMMA i think ,COMMA would have appreciated this ,COMMA even though he eschewed the importance of climate on the evolution of pigmentation during his own life .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA the topic i'm going to discuss is one which is ,COMMA in a certain sense ,COMMA very peculiar because it's very old .PERIOD 
now why do i show a cauliflower ,COMMA a very ordinary and ancient vegetable ?QUESTIONMARK 
if you try to weigh it - of course it's very easy to weigh it ,COMMA and when you eat it ,COMMA the weight matters - but suppose you try to measure its surface .PERIOD 
if you cut ,COMMA with a sharp knife ,COMMA one of the florets of a cauliflower and look at it separately ,COMMA you think of a whole cauliflower ,COMMA but smaller .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA what did humanity do with that ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA surprisingly enough ,COMMA it's good in many ways .PERIOD 
it used to be very time-consuming ,COMMA but now it's nothing .PERIOD 
anatomists were arguing very much about that .PERIOD 
this cloud is completely ,COMMA <NUM> percent artificial .PERIOD 
and the only part which is natural is a number ,COMMA the roughness of the cloud ,COMMA which is taken from nature .PERIOD 
mathematicians got into self-praise to an extent which was absolutely amazing ,COMMA that man can invent things that nature did not know .PERIOD 
in particular ,COMMA it could invent things like a curve which fills the plane .PERIOD 
i read the book that mr. eiffel wrote about his tower ,COMMA and indeed it was astonishing how much he understood .PERIOD 
then i was telling my assistant ,COMMA i don't see anything .PERIOD can you paint it ?QUESTIONMARK 
it was very easy ,COMMA and you can write many books very fast about it .PERIOD 
in a way ,COMMA it's the story of my life .PERIOD 
if you could find something new ,COMMA anything ,COMMA you will get your career made .PERIOD 
it's so complicated .PERIOD 
obviously ,COMMA from extraterrestrials .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
in <NUM> ,COMMA in what can only be considered one of the greatest crimes of humanity ,COMMA nearly one million people died of starvation in my country of birth ,COMMA ethiopia .PERIOD 
not because there was not enough food - because there was actually a surplus of food in the fertile regions of the south parts of the country - but because in the north ,COMMA people could not access or entitle themselves to that food .PERIOD 
most africans today ,COMMA by far ,COMMA are farmers .PERIOD 
it also has very high cost implications .PERIOD 
speaking of risk ,COMMA we have seen that price volatility of food crops in africa is the highest in the world .PERIOD 
in the american midwest ,COMMA farmers used to load grain onto barges and send it upriver to the chicago market .PERIOD 
what's really important is that the ecx will operate a market information system to disseminate prices in real time to farmers around the country ,COMMA using vsat technology to bring an electronic price dissemination directly to farmers .PERIOD 
and they come to the market knowing what grades their products will achieve in terms of a price premium .PERIOD 
we believe that the winds of change are here ,COMMA and that we can do it .PERIOD 
we believe that the stakes are high ,COMMA but that the returns will be even greater .PERIOD 
ethiopia's agricultural market is <NUM> percent higher than south africa's grain production ,COMMA and ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA ethiopia is the second largest maize producer in africa .PERIOD 
it's a bit funny to be at a conference dedicated to things not seen ,COMMA and present my proposal to build a 6,000-kilometer-long wall across the entire african continent .PERIOD 
the threat is desertification .PERIOD 
it is always the same ,COMMA never the same ,COMMA endlessly fascinating .PERIOD 
one billion grains of sand come into existence in the world each second .PERIOD 
just south of the sahara we find the sahel .PERIOD 
now there is an alternative to just planting trees and hoping that they won't get chopped down .PERIOD 
inside of the dunes we find shade .PERIOD 
here i am ,COMMA playing the part of the mad scientist ,COMMA working with the bugs at ucl in london ,COMMA trying to solidify them .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA i was inspired ,COMMA for my architectural form ,COMMA by tafoni ,COMMA which look a little bit like this ,COMMA this is a model representation of it .PERIOD 
these are cavernous rock structures that i found on the site in sokoto .PERIOD 
that's not true at all .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA there it is - architectural anti-desertification structures made from the desert itself .PERIOD 
my design ,COMMA as it takes you down the rabbit hole ,COMMA is fraught with many challenges and difficulties in the real world .PERIOD 
our goal is a repository of published designs so clear ,COMMA so complete ,COMMA that a single burned dvd is effectively a civilization starter kit .PERIOD 
he was talking about the space aliens .PERIOD 
i have never built an atomic pile .PERIOD 
think about it .PERIOD 
i was pretty good at the video games .PERIOD i was not very good at the other part ,COMMA so i stayed alone with the cosmos .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA you could describe this as a simple misunderstanding - a strange encounter among humans .PERIOD 
i went with my friend tim mcgonigal ,COMMA who sat on my left .PERIOD 
i remember ,COMMA she had some sort of injury to her ankle ,COMMA an ace bandage ,COMMA and she had crutches .PERIOD 
i was starting high school at the time .PERIOD i would say she was a junior ,COMMA but i had never seen her before .PERIOD she didn't go to my school .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA i liked him a lot better than the sandworms .PERIOD 
except for the girl .PERIOD 
and the way i remember it ,COMMA the movie featured these details .PERIOD 
but i was exhausted and dog-bitten ,COMMA and so i said ,COMMA no .PERIOD 
i realized that the day would only have two possible outcomes :COLON either catherine would come back to the hotel ,COMMA or she would never come back to the hotel .PERIOD 
but he did not seem so very sure ,COMMA for he sat down to wait with me .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA somebody pays you to go around and travel and look at some of the most beautiful places on the planet .PERIOD 
we know that hurricanes have always happened in the past .PERIOD 
we hear a lot about the collapse of cod .PERIOD 
it's a little hard to understand that ,COMMA because you can go to a costco in the united states and buy cheap fish .PERIOD 
the trophy fish were so big that you couldn't put any of those small fish up on it .PERIOD 
and people paid less in <NUM> dollars to catch that than what people pay now to catch those little ,COMMA tiny fish .PERIOD 
you can see the rows in the bottom ,COMMA the way you can see the rows in a field that has just been plowed to plant corn .PERIOD 
it was when i was on holiday last early autumn in france .PERIOD 
this is from the coast of brittany ,COMMA which is being enveloped in this green ,COMMA algal slime .PERIOD 
the governments of the world are taking this really seriously .PERIOD 
the consequence of that is that all those nutrients that fuel the great anchoveta fisheries ,COMMA of the sardines of california or in peru or whatever ,COMMA those slow down and those fisheries collapse .PERIOD 
now i haven't got anything against efficiency .PERIOD 
in the world i describe to you ,COMMA we have to be right over here at the right-hand side at six grams of carbon .PERIOD 
so i want to just spend a couple of minutes on system dynamics .PERIOD 
so it looks a little bit like this .PERIOD 
that's called the circular flow of the economy .PERIOD 
they want to hunker down ,COMMA they want to look to the future .PERIOD 
are we these novelty-seeking ,COMMA hedonistic ,COMMA selfish individuals ?QUESTIONMARK 
it is about allowing ourselves the freedom to become fully human ,COMMA recognizing the depth and the breadth of the human psyche and building institutions to protect rembrandt's fragile altruist within .PERIOD 
and we're going to do it .PERIOD 
we're just going to click on naturejobs.uk .PERIOD 
and this too requires investment ,COMMA investment - for example ,COMMA in places - places where we can connect ,COMMA places where we can participate ,COMMA shared spaces ,COMMA concert halls ,COMMA gardens ,COMMA public parks ,COMMA libraries ,COMMA museums ,COMMA quiet centers ,COMMA places of joy and celebration ,COMMA places of tranquility and contemplation ,COMMA sites for the cultivation of a common citizenship ,COMMA in michael sandel's lovely phrase .PERIOD 
chris anderson :COLON while they're taking the podium away ,COMMA just a quick question .PERIOD 
you're making news out of the things that tell you that we're flourishing .PERIOD 
but it has to have political leadership .PERIOD 
the napalm is burning there quite nicely .PERIOD 
oil doesn't sink ,COMMA it floats .PERIOD 
and the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water .PERIOD 
it triples the amount of oily ,COMMA messy goo that you have in the water ,COMMA and it makes it very hard to handle .PERIOD 
when the chemistry of the oil and water also hits our politics ,COMMA it's absolutely explosive .PERIOD 
they have a eureka !EXCLAMATIONMARK moment ,COMMA when we suddenly understand oil in a different context .PERIOD 
you might notice that many gas pumps ,COMMA including this one ,COMMA are designed to look like atms .PERIOD 
early journalists looked at these spills ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA this is a filthy industry .PERIOD 
and the thing about john d. is that he went into this chaotic wild-east of oil industry ,COMMA and he rationalized it into a vertically integrated company ,COMMA a multinational .PERIOD 
and then there's this guy ,COMMA okay .PERIOD 
so the thing about water oil spills is that they are very politically galvanizing .PERIOD 
they really influence people .PERIOD 
everything that we are really stemmed from this period .PERIOD 
one of the things that happened with the two previous oil spills was that we really worked on some of the symptoms .PERIOD 
and these guys ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA if they were in the u.s. they might be actually here in this room .PERIOD 
and then the guy in the exxon uniform stepped out ,COMMA and we realized it was okay .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what i'm going to talk to you about now is :COLON what do we have to do this time ?QUESTIONMARK 
we need to kind of get down and do the gritty work of reducing our dependence upon this fuel and these molecules .PERIOD 
cynthia schneider :COLON these programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society .PERIOD 
people become so engaged that they have volunteers ,COMMA just like political volunteers anyway ,COMMA who fan out over the countryside ,COMMA campaigning for their candidate .PERIOD 
one of them ,COMMA lima sahar ,COMMA is a pashtun from kandahar ,COMMA a very conservative part of the country .PERIOD 
it turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value .PERIOD 
and then a thought came across my mind :COLON if things go pear-shaped on this swim ,COMMA how long will it take for my frozen body to sink the four and a half kilometers to the bottom of the ocean ?QUESTIONMARK 
nearly two billion people - so one in three people on this earth - rely on the water from the himalayas .PERIOD 
i carried on for another five or six strokes ,COMMA and then i had nothing in my body ,COMMA and i went down to the bottom of the lake .PERIOD 
it is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have .PERIOD 
and there ,COMMA we sat down ,COMMA and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong there on mt .PERIOD everest .PERIOD 
take some time to rest and think about things .PERIOD 
i say ,COMMA i do hardware ,COMMA because it sort of conveniently encompasses everything i do .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this talk is going to be about how do we make things and what are the new ways that we're going to make things in the future .PERIOD 
and i was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues i have ,COMMA and said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA well ,COMMA if i have to talk about the future ,COMMA what is it ?QUESTIONMARK 
literally ,COMMA think of proteins as subroutines that you can string together to execute a program .PERIOD 
and this is being built by a group of students at zurich for a design competition in biology .PERIOD 
took me six years at mit ,COMMA and about that many pages to describe what i was doing ,COMMA and it took him one page .PERIOD and so this is our muse tucker .PERIOD 
and the ribosome here is another little computer that helps in the translation of the proteins .PERIOD 
these are little mechanical computers .PERIOD 
these are five-state state machines .PERIOD 
in a neutral state ,COMMA they won't bind at all .PERIOD 
so now i'm going to show you the hands-free ,COMMA autonomous self-replication .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA neil gershenfeld showed you this video on wednesday ,COMMA i believe ,COMMA but i'll show you again .PERIOD 
and how do we think about materials and structure ,COMMA sort of as an information and computation problem ?QUESTIONMARK 
this is a machine where you literally define a boundary condition .PERIOD 
we will be an overwhelmingly urban species .PERIOD 
and the correlation ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is that denser places tend to have lower emissions - which isn't really all that difficult to figure out ,COMMA if you think about it .PERIOD 
and we're basically using mobility to get the access we need .PERIOD 
and it is possible ,COMMA of course ,COMMA to increase the density of the communities around us .PERIOD 
do they even take the very waste matter that we have from food and fiber and so forth ,COMMA and turn it back into soil and sequester carbon - take carbon out of the air in the process of using our cities ?QUESTIONMARK 
because right now ,COMMA our economy by and large operates as paul hawken said ,COMMA by stealing the future ,COMMA selling it in the present and calling it gdp .PERIOD 
president clinton ,COMMA if you're here ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA why has violence declined ?QUESTIONMARK no one really knows ,COMMA but i have read four explanations ,COMMA all of which ,COMMA i think ,COMMA have some grain of plausibility .PERIOD the first is ,COMMA maybe thomas hobbes got it right .PERIOD he was the one who said that life in a state of nature was solitary ,COMMA poor ,COMMA nasty ,COMMA brutish and short .PERIOD not because ,COMMA he argued ,COMMA humans have some primordial thirst for blood or aggressive instinct or territorial imperative ,COMMA but because of the logic of anarchy .PERIOD in a state of anarchy ,COMMA there's a constant temptation to invade your neighbors preemptively ,COMMA before they invade you .PERIOD more recently ,COMMA thomas schelling gives the analogy of a homeowner who hears a rustling in the basement .PERIOD being a good american ,COMMA he has a pistol in the nightstand ,COMMA pulls out his gun ,COMMA and walks down the stairs .PERIOD 
it removes the need for a hair trigger for retaliation to make your deterrent threat credible .PERIOD and therefore ,COMMA it would lead to a state of peace .PERIOD eisner - the man who plotted the homicide rates that you failed to see in the earlier slide - argued that the timing of the decline of homicide in europe coincided with the rise of centralized states .PERIOD 
this was an argument from the political scientist james payne .PERIOD 
because we have been doing something right ,COMMA and it sure would be good to find out what it is .PERIOD 
we learned it in college .PERIOD 
we have liberia .PERIOD we have congo .PERIOD 
income per person .PERIOD i can put that here .PERIOD 
that's why we are so scared about flu ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK 
and especially ,COMMA it's interesting to see china and the united states during <NUM> years ,COMMA because i have my oldest son now working for google ,COMMA after google acquired this software .PERIOD 
mao tse-tung eventually brought health to china ,COMMA and then he died ,COMMA and then deng xiaoping started this amazing move forward .PERIOD 
and i come now ,COMMA into projections ,COMMA but i have to stop at the door of lehman brothers there ,COMMA you know ,COMMA because - that's where the projections are not valid any longer .PERIOD 
east europe ,COMMA latin america ,COMMA and oecd countries .PERIOD 
it's lincoln here ,COMMA advancing them .PERIOD 
and we have countries all this way .PERIOD 
and what has happened in the world ?QUESTIONMARK 
we used to boast about fast social progress .PERIOD 
that's where we were ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD 
and you can see it's not that easy ,COMMA that it is war which caused this .PERIOD 
and here ,COMMA in zambia ,COMMA there is peace .PERIOD 
if i split tanzania in its income ,COMMA the richer <NUM> percent in tanzania has more hiv than the poorest one .PERIOD 
and it's really different within each country .PERIOD 
it's similar to the pellagra epidemic in mississippi in the <NUM> .PERIOD 
we have seen it here in mozambique .PERIOD 
that used to be the illegal diamond trade ,COMMA from the unita-dominated area in angola .PERIOD 
don't get confused of the progress of the emerging economies and the great capacity of people in the middle income countries and in peaceful low income countries .PERIOD 
i am a reformed marketer ,COMMA and i now work in international development .PERIOD 
he said there's just not in demand .PERIOD 
and as a marketer ,COMMA i found that curious .PERIOD 
and it turns out that there are three main messages used by the donor agencies for these condoms :COLON fear ,COMMA financing and fidelity .PERIOD 
they package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of hiv ,COMMA put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them ,COMMA show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently .PERIOD 
and so the lesson is this :COLON it doesn't really matter what you're selling ;SEMICOLON you just have to think about who is your customer ,COMMA and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior .PERIOD 
it was before the avian flu had reached europe .PERIOD 
i'll see what i can do .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
generations go by ,COMMA somebody says ,COMMA hey ,COMMA why don't we put it on a stick ?QUESTIONMARK 
just absolutely delights the little ones .PERIOD 
point is :COLON there's obviously collaboration and organization going on beyond national bounds .PERIOD 
a lot of forms of non-zero-sum behavior in the realm of economics and so on in everyday life often leads to cooperation .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA this sounds like an intrinsically upbeat worldview in a way ,COMMA because when you think of non-zero ,COMMA you think win-win ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that's good .PERIOD well ,COMMA there are a few reasons that actually it's not intrinsically upbeat .PERIOD 
i have a whole global governance sermon that i will spare you right now ,COMMA because i don't think that's going to be enough anyway ,COMMA although it's essential .PERIOD 
that is to say - - thank you ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD that is to say ,COMMA remember :COLON my whole view of morality is that it boils down to self-interest .PERIOD 
doing the best i can ,COMMA ok .PERIOD 
it was kind of along these lines ,COMMA and the allegation was that i have ,COMMA quote ,COMMA affection for terrorists .PERIOD 
and a kind of saving higher moral level ,COMMA something that kind of literally saves the world .PERIOD 
yahweh is our savior means he has saved the nation of israel ,COMMA which at the time ,COMMA was a pretty high-level social organization .PERIOD 
i am very ,COMMA very happy to be amidst some of the most - the lights are really disturbing my eyes and they're reflecting on my glasses .PERIOD 
because despair ,COMMA civil war ,COMMA hunger and famine ,COMMA although they're part and parcel of our african reality ,COMMA they are not the only reality .PERIOD 
but they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship .PERIOD 
support private investment in africa ,COMMA both domestic and foreign .PERIOD 
which country is that ?QUESTIONMARK 
the productive margin in our governments' search for revenue does not lie in the domestic economy ,COMMA it lies with international donors .PERIOD 
the imf ,COMMA the world bank ,COMMA and the cartel of good intentions in the world has taken over our rights as citizens ,COMMA and therefore what our governments are doing ,COMMA because they depend on aid ,COMMA is to listen to international creditors rather than their own citizens .PERIOD 
they talk to international donors .PERIOD 
where has all the aid gone ?QUESTIONMARK 
uganda's recurrent expenditure - by recurrent what do i mean ?QUESTIONMARK 
the editor of discover told us <NUM> of them ,COMMA i'm going to give you the eleventh .PERIOD 
so they came to me - cnn - and they said ,COMMA professor seligman ,COMMA would you tell us about the state of psychology today ?QUESTIONMARK 
look ,COMMA doctor seligman ,COMMA we can see you're really not comfortable in this medium .PERIOD 
not good enough .PERIOD and that's what i'm going to be talking about .PERIOD 
it should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage .PERIOD 
and starting about six years ago ,COMMA we asked about extremely happy people .PERIOD 
that's what aristotle was talking about .PERIOD 
the first life is the pleasant life and it's simply ,COMMA as best we can find it ,COMMA it's having as many of the pleasures as you can ,COMMA as much positive emotion as you can ,COMMA and learning the skills - savoring ,COMMA mindfulness - that amplify them ,COMMA that stretch them over time and space .PERIOD 
in two of the three great arenas of life ,COMMA by the time len was <NUM> ,COMMA len was enormously successful .PERIOD the first arena was work .PERIOD 
it turned out that - len grew up in long island and he played football and watched football ,COMMA and played bridge - len is in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affectivities .PERIOD 
when he walks onto the floor of the american exchange at <NUM> in the morning ,COMMA time stops for him .PERIOD and it stops till the closing bell .PERIOD 
and we think there's a recipe for it ,COMMA and it's knowing what your highest strengths are .PERIOD 
just one example .PERIOD one person i worked with was a bagger at genuardi's .PERIOD 
her highest strength was social intelligence ,COMMA so she re-crafted bagging to make the encounter with her the social highlight of every customer's day .PERIOD 
now obviously she failed .PERIOD 
what you get out of that is not smiley-ness .PERIOD 
i'd like you to remember someone who did something enormously important that changed your life in a good direction ,COMMA and who you never properly thanked .PERIOD 
i hope all of you have such a person .PERIOD 
but they were empty .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA the parallel thing holds with technology ,COMMA entertainment and design ,COMMA i believe .PERIOD 
so in conclusion ,COMMA the eleventh reason for optimism ,COMMA in addition to the space elevator ,COMMA is that i think with technology ,COMMA entertainment and design ,COMMA we can actually increase the amount of tonnage of human happiness on the planet .PERIOD 
and if technology can ,COMMA in the next decade or two ,COMMA increase the pleasant life ,COMMA the good life and the meaningful life ,COMMA it will be good enough .PERIOD 
here's an example .PERIOD 
four years ago ,COMMA i was at the beach with my son ,COMMA and he was learning how to swim in this relatively soft surf of the delaware beaches .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this represents - this is a cross-sample of some remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photojournalists ,COMMA working at the very top of their craft - except one .PERIOD 
but to be a great photojournalist ,COMMA you have to have more than just one or two great photographs in you .PERIOD 
but the centerpiece species of zakouma are the elephants .PERIOD 
and instead ,COMMA created a story that touched our audiences deeply .PERIOD 
instead of just knowledge of this park ,COMMA he created an understanding and an empathy for the elephants ,COMMA the rangers and the many issues surrounding human-wildlife conflicts .PERIOD 
he saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part of how the entire urban area functioned .PERIOD 
we also want to look for solutions .PERIOD 
jim took what could have been a straight-up medical science story and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply .PERIOD 
but there are also times when photographers simply encounter things that are ,COMMA when it comes down to it ,COMMA just plain fun .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
and my father was a soldier ,COMMA and my uncle was a fisherman and also a poacher .PERIOD 
for three times ,COMMA i applied to biomedical science ,COMMA to be a doctor .PERIOD 
with the end of the dictatorship regime of mobutu sese seko ,COMMA that most of you know ,COMMA life became very ,COMMA very difficult .PERIOD 
so they started fleeing from the east to the west .PERIOD 
all my friends said ,COMMA we are leaving because we are a target .PERIOD 
but i'm not going to the east ,COMMA because i don't know swahili .PERIOD 
because he's pygmy ,COMMA he knows how to track elephants in the forest .PERIOD 
they came to told me ,COMMA i have to save him .PERIOD 
everywhere there has been constant extraction of mineral ,COMMA killing animals ,COMMA the logging timbers and so on .PERIOD 
that is coltan extraction ,COMMA gold mining .PERIOD 
we have to do it ,COMMA because to let our movement advance .PERIOD 
after a week ,COMMA we celebrated the birthday of that okapi ,COMMA they killed an elephant ,COMMA just <NUM> meters to the area where the zoo ,COMMA where okapi was born .PERIOD 
i devoted half of it to rebuild the herbarium ,COMMA because we didn't have good infrastructure to start plants .PERIOD 
but is gun industries a tool to rebuild ,COMMA or is it a game ?QUESTIONMARK 
and they can't go even to university .PERIOD 
thank you ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD 
one of the biggest challenges in computer graphics has been being able to create a photo-real ,COMMA digital human face .PERIOD 
and one of the reasons it is so difficult is that ,COMMA unlike aliens and dinosaurs ,COMMA we look at human faces every day .PERIOD 
we shoot all of these photographs in about three seconds .PERIOD 
if we zoom in on this photograph right here ,COMMA we can see it's a really nice photograph to have of her ,COMMA because she is lit from absolutely everywhere at the same time to get a nice image of her facial texture .PERIOD 
we're just seeing the coarse-scale geometry here .PERIOD 
and thank you very much .PERIOD 
we're roughly two days from the entrance at that point .PERIOD

next year i'll be leading an international team to <NUM> .PERIOD 
this is one of the places where planetary scientists believe there is a highest probability of the detection of the first life off earth in the ocean that exists below there .PERIOD 
it's basically a nuclear-heated torpedo .PERIOD

how do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist ?QUESTIONMARK 
if it passes the microscopic test ,COMMA we go for a collection .PERIOD 
no hands at the wheel .PERIOD 
this is all behavioral autonomy here that's being conducted by the robot on its own .PERIOD 
that's more than you pay for ted ,COMMA if google dropped their sponsorship .PERIOD 
there is a place where you can .PERIOD 
if we're going to get that ,COMMA and make that gas station possible ,COMMA we have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space .PERIOD 
it has never been done .PERIOD 
i like this equipment ,COMMA you know ,COMMA and i really value it so we're not going to burn the gear .PERIOD 
and i'm gon na try and do that within the 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within ,COMMA and to follow the ted commandments :COLON that is ,COMMA actually ,COMMA something that creates a near-death experience ,COMMA but near-death is good for creativity .PERIOD 
i think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis :COLON you know ,COMMA who am i ,COMMA why am i this particular person ,COMMA why am i not black like everybody else ?QUESTIONMARK 
i used to draw .PERIOD i thought i would be an artist .PERIOD 
and when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon ,COMMA you begin to think very much about everything .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA in quantum mechanics ,COMMA of course ,COMMA you have dark energy and dark matter .PERIOD 
and that's what i look for in my work ,COMMA a personal meaning .PERIOD 
and they also have to make a living ,COMMA and people need to be fed .PERIOD 
it may be something that is perhaps more serious - as i said ,COMMA human rights in burma .PERIOD 
this leads to this question .PERIOD 
in this case ,COMMA i was writing a story that included some kind of detail ,COMMA period of history ,COMMA a certain location .PERIOD 
especially when good things happen ,COMMA and ,COMMA in particular ,COMMA when bad things happen .PERIOD 
but i do think there's a kind of serendipity ,COMMA and i do want to know what those elements are ,COMMA so i can thank them ,COMMA and also try to find them in my life .PERIOD 
is it because i had the filter that i have such a strong coincidence in writing about these things ?QUESTIONMARK 
it takes a while ,COMMA but i have to let go of them and just go there ,COMMA and be there .PERIOD 
and the reason is that until wonder came along and figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread ,COMMA no one wanted it .PERIOD 
and when i talk about it i usually pick business because they make the best pictures that you can put in your presentation ,COMMA and because it's the easiest sort of way to keep score .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA this tv-industrial complex informed my entire childhood and probably yours .PERIOD 
and i ignored every message because i don't have a pain reliever problem .PERIOD 
i buy the stuff in the yellow box because i always have .PERIOD 
consumers don't care about you at all ;SEMICOLON they just don't care .PERIOD 
because people saw it and said - i didn't know that was there - and they noticed it .PERIOD 
and the thing is ,COMMA people in the fashion business know what it's like to be in the fashion business - they're used to it .PERIOD 
the rest of us have to figure out how to think that way .PERIOD 
how to understand that it's not about interrupting people with big full-page ads ,COMMA or insisting on meetings with people .PERIOD 
he lived in paris .PERIOD last year he sold <NUM> million dollars' worth of french bread .PERIOD

to make a product ,COMMA to market an idea ,COMMA to come up with any problem you want to solve that doesn't have a constituency with an otaku ,COMMA is almost impossible .PERIOD 
krispy kreme has a strategy ,COMMA and what they do is ,COMMA they enter a city ,COMMA they talk to the people with otaku ,COMMA and then they spread through the city to the people who've just crossed the street .PERIOD

silk .PERIOD put a product that does not need to be in the refrigerated section next to the milk in the refrigerated section .PERIOD 
for the people who were there and looking at that section ,COMMA it was remarkable .PERIOD 
and i wanted to tell stories about all the amazing things i was seeing underwater ,COMMA incredible wildlife and interesting behaviors .PERIOD 
and the ice that is there is quite thin .PERIOD 
these are the tuna ,COMMA the billfish and the sharks .PERIOD 
but the truth is we're way too efficient at catching them ,COMMA and their stocks have collapsed worldwide .PERIOD 
so this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner ,COMMA maybe seven or eight shrimp and <NUM> pounds of other animals that had to die in the process .PERIOD 
i also wanted to focus on the shark fishing industry because ,COMMA currently on planet earth ,COMMA we're killing over <NUM> million sharks every single year .PERIOD 
but before i went out to photograph this component ,COMMA i sort of wrestled with the notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark that will resonate with readers you know ,COMMA i think there's still a lot of people out there who think the only good shark is a dead shark .PERIOD 
one of the locations was this place called tiger beach ,COMMA in the northern bahamas where tiger sharks aggregate in shallow water .PERIOD 
i also searched on this story for the elusive great hammerhead ,COMMA an animal that really hadn't been photographed much until maybe about seven or <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
but this is crucial habitat and it's where they spend the first two ,COMMA three years of their lives ,COMMA until they're big enough to go out on the rest of the reef .PERIOD 
i actually jumped in and photographed this ,COMMA and with the fisherman's permission ,COMMA i cut the turtle out ,COMMA and it was able to swim free .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA you know ,COMMA thousands of other leatherbacks each year are not so fortunate ,COMMA and the species' future is in great danger .PERIOD 
you can see the coal burning plant in the background .PERIOD 
i went down there in the winter time .PERIOD 
and these are animals that had never seen humans before ,COMMA and i was one of the first people they probably had ever seen .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA they hoped that certain species of fish like the new zealand snapper would return because they had been fished to the brink of commercial extinction .PERIOD 
but when the fish came back and began predating and controlling the urchin population ,COMMA low and behold ,COMMA kelp forests emerged in shallow water .PERIOD 
and that's because the urchins eat kelp .PERIOD 
little blue cod swimming in for a dash of color .PERIOD 
the ocean is ,COMMA indeed ,COMMA resilient and tolerant to a point ,COMMA but we must be good custodians .PERIOD 
but i'm moving past malthus ,COMMA because i think that we just might be about <NUM> years from a kind of new enlightenment .PERIOD 
and the world's population expected to top out at something hopefully a bit less than <NUM> billion ,COMMA late this century .PERIOD 
but look what happened in europe after the plague :COLON rising wages ,COMMA land reform ,COMMA technological innovation ,COMMA birth of the middle class ;SEMICOLON and after that ,COMMA forward-looking social movements like the renaissance ,COMMA and later the enlightenment .PERIOD 
because transitions are dangerous times .PERIOD 
fear for the future leads to some rash decisions .PERIOD 
i was walking in the market one day with my wife ,COMMA and somebody stuck a cage in my face .PERIOD 
so we're in east borneo .PERIOD this is the place where i started .PERIOD 
what we did was we formulated recipes - how to go from a starting situation where you have nothing to a target situation .PERIOD 
and once the soil gets dried ,COMMA you're in a dry season - you get cracks ,COMMA oxygen goes in ,COMMA flames come out and the problem starts all over again .PERIOD 
this is what it looked like for three months .PERIOD 
we lost all the crops .PERIOD no children gained weight for over a year ;SEMICOLON they lost <NUM> iq points .PERIOD it was a disaster for orangutans and people .PERIOD 
that was why i put it as a single point up there .PERIOD 
you need the bacteria to fix nitrogen ,COMMA and without those microorganisms ,COMMA you won't have any performance at all .PERIOD 
and we have monitored every single one of those trees from space .PERIOD 
in the beginning ,COMMA maybe pineapples and beans and corn ;SEMICOLON in the second phase ,COMMA there will be bananas and papayas ;SEMICOLON later on ,COMMA there will be chocolate and chilies .PERIOD 
and that's green .PERIOD if you look from the tower - this is when we start attacking the grass .PERIOD

each of the families that have sold their land now get a piece of land back .PERIOD 
if one member trespasses the agreement ,COMMA and does cut down trees ,COMMA the other <NUM> members have to decide what's going to happen to him .PERIOD 
in north sulawesi it is the cooperative - they have a democratic culture there ,COMMA so there you can use the local justice system to protect your system .PERIOD 
they can now sell part of those fruits to the orangutan project .PERIOD 
now i think the real key to doing it ,COMMA to give a simple answer ,COMMA is integration .PERIOD 
there's no matter of scale .PERIOD it's not a question of scale ,COMMA it's not a question of financial resources .PERIOD

if you said to them ,COMMA don't do this anymore ,COMMA they'd wonder what you were talking about .PERIOD 
you have to create the circumstances where they show themselves .PERIOD 
it means challenging what we take for granted ,COMMA things that we think are obvious .PERIOD 
he said this in december <NUM> to the second annual meeting of congress .PERIOD

i've actually eaten seven of those baskets and they're very good .PERIOD 
remember i'm the black kid from the <NUM> who got his life saved with ceramics .PERIOD 
let me show you what these people do .PERIOD 
we have a world class gallery because we believe that poor kids need a world class gallery ,COMMA so i designed this thing .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA he jumped in the van ,COMMA he went to miss jones' house and said ,COMMA miss jones ,COMMA i knew you wanted to come to your kid's art opening but you probably didn't have a ride .PERIOD 
and there is no statistical difference between the white parents and the black parents .PERIOD 
she said ,COMMA well ,COMMA i work for a company called hewlett-packard .PERIOD 
and i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA there's an easy solution to that problem .PERIOD 
he said ,COMMA because i heard you built the center and i didn't believe that you did it ,COMMA and i wanted to see for myself .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA we did win ,COMMA and our name was literally in lights over madison square garden .PERIOD 
and that was our first recording studio ,COMMA which was the broom closet .PERIOD 
and this is what i want to do when i grow up .PERIOD 
this is in a place called san francisco .PERIOD 
and i said ,COMMA herbie ,COMMA this is my concept of a training center for poor people .PERIOD 
and now i really want to build one .PERIOD 
and i promised these people that i was going to build this thing ,COMMA and we're going to build it all right .PERIOD

and i don't think i'm crazy .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA <NUM> times more bacterial cells than human cells on a human being .PERIOD 
at the best ,COMMA you're <NUM> percent human ,COMMA but more likely about one percent human ,COMMA depending on which of these metrics you like .PERIOD 
and so we wanted to think if there couldn't be a different way that bacteria live .PERIOD 
what you're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium ,COMMA a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean ,COMMA named vibrio fischeri .PERIOD 
we just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room ,COMMA and this is what we see .PERIOD 
but when they grew to a certain cell number all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously .PERIOD 
the question that we had is how can bacteria ,COMMA these primitive organisms ,COMMA tell the difference from times when they're alone ,COMMA and times when they're in a community ,COMMA and then all do something together .PERIOD 
this is like the stealth bomber of the ocean .PERIOD 
and then as the cells grow ,COMMA they're all releasing that molecule into the environment ,COMMA so there's lots of molecule there .PERIOD 
but the one that's probably the most important to you is virulence .PERIOD 
this is the vibrio fischeri molecule .PERIOD 
so then we started to look at other bacteria ,COMMA and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we've discovered .PERIOD 
the left-hand part of the molecule is identical in every single species of bacteria .PERIOD 
what that does is to confer exquisite species specificities to these languages .PERIOD 
each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other .PERIOD 
each bacteria uses a particular molecule that's its language that allows it to count its own siblings .PERIOD 
anywhere on your body ,COMMA it looks pretty much like this ,COMMA and what i hope you can see is that there's all kinds of bacteria there .PERIOD 
couldn't these be new kinds of antibiotics ?QUESTIONMARK 
and so now of course we have this global problem in infectious diseases .PERIOD 
the first one is we've targeted the intraspecies communication system .PERIOD 
i hope that what you've learned is that bacteria can distinguish self from other .PERIOD 
this is exactly what happens in your body .PERIOD 
but then ,COMMA to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria that live on the earth ,COMMA we've also made pro-quorum sensing molecules .PERIOD 
remember you have these <NUM> times or more bacterial cells in you or on you ,COMMA keeping you healthy .PERIOD 
so i'm really a basic scientist ,COMMA not a clinician ,COMMA but in the last year and a half i've started to switch over ,COMMA to use what we've been learning about these patterns of activity to develop prosthetic devices ,COMMA and what i wanted to do today is show you an example of this .PERIOD 
it's really our first foray into this .PERIOD 
like this pattern of pulses here actually means baby's face ,COMMA and so when the brain gets this pattern of pulses ,COMMA it knows that what was out there was a baby's face ,COMMA and if it got a different pattern it would know that what was out there was ,COMMA say ,COMMA a dog ,COMMA or another pattern would be a house .PERIOD 
so this is what we've been working on ,COMMA and this is what our prosthetic does .PERIOD 
so a completely blind retina ,COMMA even one with no front-end circuitry at all ,COMMA no photoreceptors ,COMMA can now send out normal signals ,COMMA signals that the brain can understand .PERIOD 
and so with the standard method ,COMMA the cells do fire ,COMMA they just don't fire in the normal firing patterns because they don't have the right code .PERIOD 
this is just actually the first one that we tried .PERIOD 
so it's different from the motor prosthetics where you're communicating from the brain to a device .PERIOD here we have to communicate from the outside world into the brain and be understood ,COMMA and be understood by the brain .PERIOD 
you can just call it out .PERIOD 
who else ?QUESTIONMARK 
the worst flute players .PERIOD 
actually ,COMMA that was aristotle's answer too .PERIOD 
peter :COLON the greatest benefit to all .PERIOD 
the greatest benefit to all .PERIOD 
all right .PERIOD 
aristotle had a different reason for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players .PERIOD 
and the point ,COMMA the essential nature ,COMMA of musical performance is to produce excellent music .PERIOD 
suppose you were on the supreme court .PERIOD 
suppose you were deciding the justice of this case .PERIOD 
raise your hand ,COMMA and we'll try to get you a microphone .PERIOD 
that's part of the game of golf ?QUESTIONMARK 
charlie ,COMMA what do you say to warren ?QUESTIONMARK 
warren :COLON i am not a golfer .PERIOD 
he wouldn't have granted the cart ,COMMA and he had a very interesting dissent .PERIOD 
but since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement ,COMMA that is ,COMMA what distinguishes games from productive activity ,COMMA it is quite impossible to say that any of a game's arbitrary rules is essential .PERIOD 
first ,COMMA no real sports fan would talk that way .PERIOD 
on the face of it ,COMMA it seemed to be - this debate about the golf cart - an argument about fairness ,COMMA what's an unfair advantage .PERIOD 
so if golfing is the kind of game that can be played while riding around in a golf cart ,COMMA it would be hard to confer on the golfing greats the status that we confer ,COMMA the honor and recognition that goes to truly great athletes .PERIOD 
how many here favor the first policy :COLON the state should recognize traditional marriage only ?QUESTIONMARK 
i'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together ,COMMA and actually talk about this a bit more than we do .PERIOD 
that was easy .PERIOD ok .PERIOD 
ok .PERIOD hands up :COLON anyone in the audience who's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing ?QUESTIONMARK 
you know ,COMMA a lot of people said ,COMMA well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time .PERIOD 
it's a global trance .PERIOD 
but the question is ,COMMA are they so dangerous - these risks of doing something about aging - that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite ,COMMA namely ,COMMA leaving aging as it is ?QUESTIONMARK 
people worry about overpopulation ;SEMICOLON they say ,COMMA well ,COMMA if we fix aging ,COMMA no one's going to die to speak of ,COMMA or at least the death toll is going to be much lower ,COMMA only from crossing st. giles carelessly .PERIOD 
this pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things .PERIOD 
but it isn't .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live ,COMMA in terms of remaining life expectancy ,COMMA as measured by their health ,COMMA for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive .PERIOD 
but if you're only <NUM> ,COMMA then there's a chance that you might be able to pull out of the dive and ,COMMA you know - - eventually get through this and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense ,COMMA in terms of your youthfulness ,COMMA both physical and mental ,COMMA and in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA if you're a bit younger than that ,COMMA then you're never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes .PERIOD 
and that's quite a thought .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA in other words ,COMMA we add two years - we treble their remaining lifespan ,COMMA starting from the point that we started the therapies .PERIOD 
so we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people's attitudes ,COMMA and of course that has enormous implications .PERIOD 
because the critical thing about this is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology ,COMMA the damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life ,COMMA starting before we're born .PERIOD 
and the reason it's a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago and that is pretty good news ,COMMA because it means that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we've come a long way in biology in these <NUM> years ,COMMA so the fact that we haven't extended this list is a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done .PERIOD 
and you know what happened .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA look - how long does it take to spend that on the war in iraq ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i think we know how to do it .PERIOD and i'll stop there .PERIOD 
audience :COLON species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate .PERIOD 
if i project that ,COMMA that would make me think that i would live until <NUM> if i don't crash on my motorbike .PERIOD 
ninety-nine pence was the starting price and no reserve .PERIOD 
then there was the volcano that interrupted the travel plans of almost all of you and many of your friends ,COMMA including president obama .PERIOD 
i'm here to tell you the story of audur capital ,COMMA which is a financial firm founded by me and kristin - who you see in the picture - in the spring of <NUM> ,COMMA just over a year before the economic collapse hit .PERIOD 
and we believe that doing emotional due diligence is just as important as doing financial due diligence .PERIOD 
so we like to see profits ,COMMA plus positive social and environmental benefits ,COMMA when we invest .PERIOD 
now that we've had all that happen ,COMMA and we have all this data out there telling us that it's much better to have diversity around the decision-making tables ,COMMA will we see business and finance change ?QUESTIONMARK 
i want to see more revolutionary thinking ,COMMA and i remain hopeful .PERIOD 
for me it was the start of a long journey ,COMMA but i decided that day to matter .PERIOD 
external debt - something that i can tell you a long story about because i personally worked on one of the biggest debts on the continent - has come down dramatically .PERIOD 
because we are confronted with a challenge .PERIOD 
we need to bring it back to say ,COMMA what is the combination of all these factors that is going to yield what we want ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i want to tell you something .PERIOD 
the issue is not that .PERIOD 
she was three years old and i was <NUM> .PERIOD 
now i put my sister on my back - burning - and i walked <NUM> kilometers with her strapped on my back .PERIOD 
in about two to three hours ,COMMA she started to move .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA we have to use it well .PERIOD 
for which many people ,COMMA even from other parts of the world ,COMMA are going there to find jobs .PERIOD 
they are just discovering .PERIOD 
let's sit down and really tell you where the money should be channeled and where this aid should go .PERIOD 
how can we get government to combine properly with these private foundations ,COMMA with the international organizations ,COMMA and with our private sector .PERIOD 
aid cannot solve our problems ,COMMA i'm firmly convinced about that .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA the chinese minister of finance said to me ,COMMA when i asked him what are we doing wrong in nigeria .PERIOD 
infrastructure ,COMMA infrastructure ,COMMA infrastructure and discipline .PERIOD 
and i repeat it for the continent .PERIOD 
and lastly ,COMMA what are you going to do to be part of this partnership of aid ,COMMA government ,COMMA private sector and the african as an individual ?QUESTIONMARK 
i will say though that ,COMMA after having done surgery a lot ,COMMA it's somewhat similar to playing a musical instrument .PERIOD 
and i'll tell you that most scientific studies of music ,COMMA they're very dense ,COMMA and when you actually go through them ,COMMA it's very hard to recognize the music in it .PERIOD 
that blood flow causes an increase in local blood to that area with a deoxyhemoglobin change in concentration .PERIOD 
charles limb :COLON this is a plastic midi piano keyboard that we use for the jazz experiments .PERIOD 
and so what we did was we brought professional jazz players to the nih ,COMMA and we had them memorize this piece of music on the left ,COMMA the lower-left - which is what you heard me playing - and then we had them improvise to the same exact chord changes .PERIOD 
and i've listened to that solo <NUM> times ,COMMA and i still like it .PERIOD 
and so we had this focal area called the medial prefrontal cortex that went way up in activity .PERIOD 
we had this broad patch of area called the lateral prefrontal cortex that went way down in activity ,COMMA and i'll summarize that for you here .PERIOD 
now these are multifunctional areas of the brain .PERIOD 
the fact that we do it over and over again lets you acclimate to your surroundings .PERIOD 
so how do you study rap scientifically ?QUESTIONMARK 
with this big screen ,COMMA you can all rap with me .PERIOD okay ?QUESTIONMARK 
he's just memorized a rhyme for us .PERIOD 
and what we see ,COMMA we do see language areas lighting up ,COMMA but then - eyes closed - when you are free-styling versus memorizing ,COMMA you've got major visual areas lighting up .PERIOD 
you have heightened brain activity when you're doing a comparable task ,COMMA when that one task is creative and the other task is memorized .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA don't get me wrong .PERIOD calculus is an important subject .PERIOD 
and every student who studies math ,COMMA science ,COMMA engineering ,COMMA economics ,COMMA they should definitely learn calculus by the end of their freshman year of college .PERIOD 
it's understanding data .PERIOD 
look ,COMMA the world has changed from analog to digital .PERIOD 
the majority of our functional brain is distributed over the outer surface layer of the brain ,COMMA and to increase the area that's available for mental capacity ,COMMA the brain surface is highly folded .PERIOD 
our breakthrough was to create an algorithm that unfolds the cortex ,COMMA so that we can map the signals closer to its source ,COMMA and therefore making it capable of working across a mass population .PERIOD 
the second challenge is the actual device for observing brainwaves .PERIOD 
with neutral ,COMMA there's nothing in particular that evan needs to do .PERIOD 
it takes eight seconds to do this ,COMMA and now that that's done ,COMMA we can choose a movement-based action .PERIOD 
so evan ,COMMA choose something that you can visualize clearly in your mind .PERIOD 
so the idea here now is that evan needs to imagine the object coming forward into the screen ,COMMA and there's a progress bar that will scroll across the screen while he's doing that .PERIOD 
the first time ,COMMA nothing will happen ,COMMA because the system has no idea how he thinks about pull .PERIOD 
so :COLON one ,COMMA two ,COMMA three ,COMMA go .PERIOD 
okay .PERIOD 
ah ,COMMA good job !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
that's really amazing .PERIOD 
so what you want to do - at least with movement-based actions ,COMMA we do that all the time ,COMMA so you can visualize it .PERIOD 
so i'd like to show you a few examples ,COMMA because there are many possible applications for this new interface .PERIOD 
and bed nets have an effect on the epidemic ,COMMA but you're never going to make it extinct with bed nets .PERIOD 
we could spend hours going over this .PERIOD 
it creates a very high peak power and it lets you do all kinds of interesting things ;SEMICOLON in particular ,COMMA it lets you find hemozoin .PERIOD 
and using both this technique and other optical techniques ,COMMA we think we can make those diagnostics .PERIOD 
we also have another hemozoin-oriented therapy for malaria :COLON a way ,COMMA in acute cases ,COMMA to actually take the malaria parasite and filter it out of the blood system .PERIOD 
you can give drug administration .PERIOD 
we have all of the precipitation data and the temperature data .PERIOD 
that's very important because the humidity and precipitation tell you whether you've got standing pools of water for the mosquitoes to breed .PERIOD 
so that sets the stage on which you do this .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA one of the ways you can make them not fly is with ddt .PERIOD 
in <NUM> ,COMMA there were <NUM> cases a year of malaria in the united states ,COMMA but ddt and a massive public health effort managed to squelch it .PERIOD 
audience :COLON yeah !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
nathan myhrvold :COLON okay ,COMMA so our legal department prepared a disclaimer ,COMMA and here it is .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA after thinking about this a little bit we thought ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it probably would be simpler to do this with a nonlethal laser .PERIOD 
we have the device over here .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA that's a fairly straightforward image processing routine ,COMMA and let me show you how it works .PERIOD 
this is very satisfying .PERIOD 
it grows and is nurtured .PERIOD 
basically a restaurant just like any other .PERIOD 
chairs :COLON recycled and recyclable .PERIOD 
i was experimenting with these - i don't know if you can see it - but there's a work surface there .PERIOD 
this is the kitchen ,COMMA which is in the same room .PERIOD 
rather than me putting a dish down ,COMMA they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted .PERIOD 
this is the waste room .PERIOD 
in here ,COMMA i have produce and boxes that are unavoidable .PERIOD 
i'm taking the temperature of the canal outside ,COMMA pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism ,COMMA it's turning through these amazing sails on the roof ,COMMA and that ,COMMA in turn ,COMMA is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant ,COMMA cooling them ,COMMA or heating them ,COMMA as the need may be .PERIOD 
in the canal ,COMMA which is just outside the restaurant ,COMMA there is hundreds of meters of coil piping .PERIOD 
he's growing all his own fruit ,COMMA and that's fantastic .PERIOD 
so you've got to watch your space for that .PERIOD 
okay .PERIOD so this is my next project .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA the whole thing is is super-sustainable .PERIOD 
and no one's doing that just yet .PERIOD 
this is a herd ,COMMA and it is built according to genetical codes .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA it's a new invention of the wheel .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA this is better than a wheel ,COMMA because when you try to drive with your bicycle on the beach ,COMMA you will notice it's very hard to do .PERIOD 
ok. good .PERIOD 
so as soon it has been to the sea ,COMMA it changes the pattern of zeroes and ones here ,COMMA and it knows always where it is on the beach .PERIOD so it's very simple brain .PERIOD 
so it's a sort of imagination of the simple world of the beach animal .PERIOD 
we did haemophilus influenzae and then the smallest genome of a self-replicating organism ,COMMA that of mycoplasma genitalium .PERIOD 
in <NUM> ,COMMA we published our first success .PERIOD 
so ham smith and clyde hutchison developed some new methods for making error-free dna at a small level .PERIOD 
and we can walk through the reasons for that ,COMMA but basically the small cell took on the order of one to two months to get results from ,COMMA whereas the larger ,COMMA faster-growing cell takes only two days .PERIOD 
it's an amazing step forward ,COMMA but we had a problem because now we had the bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast .PERIOD 
and we thought this would be a great test bed for learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast and transplant them .PERIOD 
we narrowed it down to one fragment ;SEMICOLON we sequenced it and found just one base pair had been deleted in an essential gene .PERIOD 
we got a text from dan saying that ,COMMA now ,COMMA the first blue colonies existed .PERIOD 
so early on ,COMMA we developed the notion of putting in watermarks in the dna to absolutely make clear that the dna was synthetic .PERIOD 
it's significant to us .PERIOD 
so when you see how long it took to get an <NUM> vaccine out ,COMMA we think we can shorten that process quite substantially .PERIOD 
you may have heard about the koran's idea of paradise being <NUM> virgins ,COMMA and i promise i will come back to those virgins .PERIOD 
it's just <NUM> words in arabic ,COMMA but anywhere from <NUM> to <NUM> in translation .PERIOD 
but all is not lost in translation .PERIOD 
and that number <NUM> never appears .PERIOD 
there are no <NUM> virgins in the koran .PERIOD 
they all live in colonies consisting of one or a few queens ,COMMA and then all the ants you see walking around are sterile female workers .PERIOD 
here's my study site .PERIOD this is really a picture of ants ,COMMA and the rabbit just happens to be there .PERIOD 
ants never make more ants ;SEMICOLON colonies make more colonies .PERIOD 
and this shows a recently virgin queen .PERIOD here's her wings .PERIOD 
she lays eggs ,COMMA she feeds the larvae - so an ant starts as an egg ,COMMA then it's a larva .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA things happen to an ant colony .PERIOD 
when it rains in the summer ,COMMA it floods in the desert .PERIOD 
and that's the process that i call task allocation .PERIOD 
that is ,COMMA that there are chambers inside ,COMMA they line the walls of the chambers with moist soil and it dries to a kind of an adobe-like surface in it .PERIOD 
and finally ,COMMA the midden workers put some kind of territorial chemical in the garbage .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA an ant starts out somewhere near the queen .PERIOD 
the queen's in there somewhere ;SEMICOLON she just lays eggs .PERIOD 
so just to reinforce that what you might have thought about ant queens isn't true - you know ,COMMA even if the queen did have the intelligence to send chemical messages through this whole network of chambers to tell the ants outside what to do ,COMMA there is no way that such messages could make it in time to see the shifts in the allocation of workers that we actually see outside the nest .PERIOD 
we started out with model airplane paint and then we found these wonderful little japanese markers ,COMMA and they work really well .PERIOD 
and so just to summarize the result ,COMMA well it turns out that yes ,COMMA the different tasks are interdependent .PERIOD 
and the second result ,COMMA which was surprising to a lot of people ,COMMA was that ants actually switch tasks .PERIOD 
the same ant doesn't do the same task over and over its whole life .PERIOD 
this process changes with colony age ,COMMA and it changes like this .PERIOD 
instead ,COMMA something about the organization must be changing as the colony gets older .PERIOD 
and what we're learning is that an ant uses the pattern of its antennal contacts ,COMMA the rate at which it meets ants of other tasks ,COMMA in deciding what to do .PERIOD 
and we've just recently demonstrated this by putting extract of hydrocarbons on little glass beads ,COMMA and dropping the beads gently down into the nest entrance at the right rate .PERIOD 
so i want now to show you a bit of film - and this will start out ,COMMA first of all ,COMMA showing you the nest entrance .PERIOD 
this is taken through a fiber optics microscope .PERIOD it's down inside the nest .PERIOD 
each ant ,COMMA then ,COMMA as it comes back in ,COMMA is contacting other ants .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what's interesting about this system is that it's messy .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA i don't want to say that this kind of haphazard pattern of interactions produces a factory that works with the precision and efficiency of clockwork .PERIOD 
that we can take the whole idea that gave birth to the internet and bring it down to the physical world in this internet zero ,COMMA this internet of devices .PERIOD 
unlike this screen where the dots are placed carefully ,COMMA this is a raw material .PERIOD 
this was just a proof of principle he did of tiles that interact magnetically ,COMMA where you write a code ,COMMA much like protein folding ,COMMA that specifies their structure .PERIOD 
but i had a problem .PERIOD once i had all these machines ,COMMA i was spending too much time teaching students to use them .PERIOD 
when a user screams into scream buddy ,COMMA their scream is silenced .PERIOD 
but you don't use it for inventory and payroll ;SEMICOLON dec is now twice bankrupt .PERIOD you don't need personal fabrication in the home to buy what you can buy because you can buy it .PERIOD 
and the way you close it is not it for the masses but it development for the masses .PERIOD 
you can see it in their face ,COMMA just this joy of ,COMMA i can do it .PERIOD 
we designed a network sensor ,COMMA and kids would show up and refuse to leave the lab .PERIOD 
this is late at ,COMMA you know ,COMMA <NUM> o'clock at night and i think i was the only person surprised when what she built worked the first time .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA again ,COMMA that was just for the joy of it .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA in turn ,COMMA businesses started to grow ,COMMA like making these antennas .PERIOD 
we're learning more from them than we're giving them .PERIOD 
i was showing my kids in a fab lab how to use it .PERIOD 
real invention is happening in these labs .PERIOD 
pdps came between mainframes and minicomputers .PERIOD 
it was there because they wanted to find animals in the mountains but it outgrew it ,COMMA so they built this extraordinary village for the lab .PERIOD 
if this room full of heroes is just clever enough ,COMMA you can solve the problems .PERIOD 
the message coming from the fab labs is that the other five billion people on the planet aren't just technical sinks ;SEMICOLON they're sources .PERIOD 
that has got to be stopped .PERIOD 
somehow that doesn't seem right .PERIOD 
so here we are using <NUM> million barrels a day - producing eight ,COMMA importing <NUM> ,COMMA and from the <NUM> ,COMMA five comes from opec .PERIOD 
now i had people in washington last week told me ,COMMA he said ,COMMA the saudis can produce the oil for five dollars a barrel .PERIOD 
we're headed to natural gas .PERIOD 
run it through the separator and you're ready to use it .PERIOD 
natural gas will fit all of those .PERIOD 
it will replace or be able to be used for that .PERIOD 
so i have tried to target on where we use the natural gas .PERIOD 
and where i've targeted is on the heavy-duty trucks .PERIOD 
there are eight million of them .PERIOD 
i'm back to theorist again .PERIOD 
so there's nothing going on that impresses me in washington on that plan ,COMMA other than i'm trying to focus on that eight million 18-wheelers .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
that'll make you abandon something .PERIOD 
i'm a geologist ,COMMA got out of school in <NUM> ,COMMA and i've been in the industry my entire life .PERIOD 
i'm not a big natural gas producer .PERIOD 
you've made the money you need .PERIOD 
does that make sense ?QUESTIONMARK 
the government is not successful on these things .PERIOD 
but chris ,COMMA i think where we're headed ,COMMA the long-term ,COMMA i don't mind going back to nuclear .PERIOD 
there isn't anything wrong with nuke .PERIOD 
tbp :COLON fracking ?QUESTIONMARK what is fracking ?QUESTIONMARK 
i mean seriously ,COMMA the department of energy did not have anything to do with fracking .PERIOD 
the first frack job was in <NUM> .PERIOD 
there's no problems .PERIOD 
if someone comes to you with a plan that really looks like it might be part of this solution ,COMMA are you ready to invest in those technologies ,COMMA even if they aren't maximized for profits ,COMMA they might be maximized for the future health of the planet ?QUESTIONMARK 
when you think about resilience and technology it's actually much easier .PERIOD 
the internet was also very real .PERIOD this is a real way for humans to communicate with each other .PERIOD it's a big deal .PERIOD 
people on the east coast in <NUM> ,COMMA when they first started to get the news ,COMMA they thought ,COMMA ah ,COMMA this isn't real .PERIOD 
you had dotcom fever .PERIOD and you had gold fever .PERIOD 
and they wouldn't let the other half out to go look for the first half because they were afraid they wouldn't come back .PERIOD

so there's a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly optimistic and that analogy is the electric industry .PERIOD 
this was a huge - as you would expect - a huge capital build out .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA it was because that heavy infrastructure had already been laid down .PERIOD 
they would - each room typically had a light bulb socket at the top .PERIOD 
and there's a rotor there - that this motor is spinning .PERIOD 
and they were really happy that the guy had a speakerphone because then they had to wait on hold for an hour to talk to somebody to give them an access code after they got there .PERIOD 
because ,COMMA you know ,COMMA resilience - if you think of it in terms of the gold rush ,COMMA then you'd be pretty depressed right now because the last nugget of gold would be gone .PERIOD 
she - but you know ,COMMA if you really do believe that it's the very ,COMMA very beginning ,COMMA if you believe it's the <NUM> hurley washing machine ,COMMA then you're incredibly optimistic .PERIOD and i do think that that's where we are .PERIOD 
the golden rule is great .PERIOD i'm a big supporter of both .PERIOD 
in the beginning ,COMMA there was compassion ,COMMA and i mean not just when human beings first showed up ,COMMA but actually even before that .PERIOD 
i warned you this was not going to be very warm and fuzzy .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA there's more good news that came along later in evolution ,COMMA a second kind of evolutionary logic .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA you wind up most easily extending compassion to friends and allies .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i hope i've got your attention with this promise of good news that may save the world .PERIOD 
basically ,COMMA a zero-sum game is the kind you're used to in sports ,COMMA where there's a winner and a loser .PERIOD 
either way ,COMMA your fortunes add up to zero .PERIOD that's a zero-sum game .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA if you're playing doubles ,COMMA then the person on your side of the net is in a non-zero-sum relationship with you ,COMMA because every point is either good for both of you - positive ,COMMA win-win - or bad for both of you ,COMMA it's lose-lose .PERIOD 
the deployment of the golden rule most naturally happens along these non-zero-sum channels .PERIOD 
with zero-sum channels you would expect something else .PERIOD 
but it may .PERIOD and the good news is that history has naturally expanded these webs of non-zero-sumness ,COMMA these webs that can be these channels for compassion .PERIOD 
that's the story of civilization .PERIOD 
and also ,COMMA sometimes people don't recognize the non-zero-sum dynamics in the world .PERIOD 
i think politicians can help foster non-zero-sum relationships ,COMMA economic engagement is generally better than blockades and so on ,COMMA in this regard .PERIOD 
if there's one thing i can encourage everyone to do ,COMMA politicians ,COMMA religious leaders ,COMMA and us ,COMMA it would be what i call expanding the moral imagination - that is to say ,COMMA your ability to put yourself in the shoes of people in very different circumstances .PERIOD 
once upon a time ,COMMA i did a book called how buildings learn .PERIOD 
so the design problem for today is going to be ,COMMA how do you house an eventual monumental clock like this so it can really tick ,COMMA save time beautifully for <NUM> centuries ?QUESTIONMARK 
and it looked like a way to go ,COMMA until you start thinking about ,COMMA what does deep time do to a building ?QUESTIONMARK 
this is the parthenon .PERIOD it's only <NUM> years old ,COMMA and look what happened to it .PERIOD 
and now it's a pathetic ruin and no one even knows what it was used for .PERIOD 
underground in a place that's really solid .PERIOD 
it's right on the eastern border of nevada .PERIOD 
it starts with the image .PERIOD the image is a picture you have in your mind of the goal at the end of the journey .PERIOD 
the labyrinth is a concept ,COMMA it's like a twilight zone ,COMMA it's a place where it's difficult ,COMMA where you get disoriented ,COMMA maybe you get scared - but you have to go through it if you're going to get to some kind of deep reintegration .PERIOD 
the hillis algorithm .PERIOD <NUM> factorial gives you that number .PERIOD

what are the elements that will most affect your ideas and decisions ?QUESTIONMARK 
people think they're just the size of shrubs ,COMMA but that's not actually true .PERIOD 
that's interesting .PERIOD 
but it goes a mile-and-a-half in a straight line ,COMMA due east into the range ,COMMA into very interesting territory - except that ,COMMA as you'll see when we go inside in a minute ,COMMA we were hoping for limestone but in there is just shale .PERIOD 
competent rock is rock that will hold itself up without any shoring .PERIOD 
you may recognize a couple of the miners there .PERIOD 
and alexander rose on the left there worked with a bunch of people from the national park to survey the whole mine .PERIOD it's a mile deep .PERIOD 
kurt bollacker and alexander rose designed a radically wireless station .PERIOD 
but there's no bears ,COMMA and there's no poison oak ,COMMA and there's basically no people because this place has been empty for a long time .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA here's a potential approach .PERIOD 
you need to come up the lincoln canyon .PERIOD 
it's a secret passage .PERIOD it's like something from tolkien .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the next thing i hear is ,COMMA i've made it to the top .PERIOD you can see all of creation from up here .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA there he is .PERIOD that's alexander rose .PERIOD 
this discovery changed everything about our sense of these cliffs and what to do with them .PERIOD

so here we're looking from the south ,COMMA look north .PERIOD 
over on the eastern side it's gentle ,COMMA as you can see .PERIOD 
and that's not snow - that's what the white limestone looks like .PERIOD 
another is the experience in the mountain .PERIOD 
and the third is the experience from the mountain ,COMMA which is really dominated by the view shed of the spring valley there behind danny ,COMMA and if you look off to the right ,COMMA out there ,COMMA <NUM> miles across to the schell creek range .PERIOD 
this is rocky mountain junipers that have been there for thousands of years .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA let's take one more look at the mountain itself .PERIOD 
and this stone takes a perfect polish .PERIOD 
most of the amazingness of the clock we can borrow from the amazingness of the mountain .PERIOD 
and often ,COMMA i'm driving in a taxi and i see a hole in a shirt ,COMMA or something that looks very interesting or pretty or functional in some way that i'd never seen happen before .PERIOD

and these ideas and narratives that bump people across borders are increasingly beginning to affect the way in which people behave .PERIOD 
if we look at islamists ,COMMA if we look at the phenomenon of far-right fascists ,COMMA one thing they've been very good at ,COMMA one thing that they've actually been exceeding in ,COMMA is communicating across borders ,COMMA using technologies to organize themselves ,COMMA to propagate their message and to create truly global phenomena .PERIOD 
but having been born in essex ,COMMA at the age of <NUM> ,COMMA i joined an organization .PERIOD

and why are democracy aspirants falling behind ?QUESTIONMARK 
so the ideas and the narratives of al-qaeda come to your mind immediately .PERIOD 
one of their leaders was killed in pakistan recently .PERIOD 
to go around saying that i believe democratic culture is the best that we've arrived at as a form of political organizing is associated with extremism .PERIOD

the first ,COMMA to my mind ,COMMA is what i call as the ideas that have arrived .PERIOD 
we thought of people as a liability .PERIOD 
this change has contributed to the vitality and the whole economy .PERIOD 
and the fact that we have english is now becoming a huge strategic asset .PERIOD 
one is the question of education .PERIOD 
the third thing is again cities .PERIOD 
but today ,COMMA finally ,COMMA after economic reforms ,COMMA and economic growth ,COMMA i think the notion that cities are engines of economic growth ,COMMA cities are engines of creativity ,COMMA cities are engines of innovation ,COMMA have finally been accepted .PERIOD 
a lot of the indian problems are related to the ideology of caste and other things .PERIOD 
therefore we will fundamentally rethink the way we look at the environment ,COMMA the way we look at energy ,COMMA the way we create whole new paradigms of development .PERIOD 
why does what's happening <NUM> thousand miles away matter to all of you ?QUESTIONMARK 
and that makes a huge difference .PERIOD 
when india was growing at about three ,COMMA <NUM> percent and the population was growing at two percent ,COMMA its per capita income was doubling every <NUM> years .PERIOD 
i've been there six times :COLON four times i did work with national geographic ,COMMA making tectonic plate measurements ;SEMICOLON twice ,COMMA i went with nasa doing remote sensing devices .PERIOD 
that gives you an idea of just how severe things are near the summit .PERIOD 
there were three other expeditions on the mountain ,COMMA an american team ,COMMA a new zealand team and an imax team .PERIOD 
and from there we climb up to camp two ,COMMA which is sort of the foreground .PERIOD 
if you notice ,COMMA the summit of everest is black .PERIOD 
this is not good weather to climb in ,COMMA so the climbers are just waiting ,COMMA hoping that the wind's going to die down .PERIOD 
the summit would be in the foreground .PERIOD 
but what happened that year was the wind suddenly and unexpectedly picked up .PERIOD 
i have an oxygen hose connected here .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA this is a view taken on the summit ridge itself .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA either way ,COMMA you fall for the rest of your life .PERIOD 
this is taken from camp three ,COMMA where i was .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA as the climbers came by me ,COMMA i sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition to continue on further down .PERIOD 
his wife was home in new zealand ,COMMA seven months pregnant with their first child ,COMMA and rob asked to be patched into her .PERIOD that was done ,COMMA and rob and his wife had their last conversation .PERIOD 
it's a tackle box filled with medical supplies .PERIOD 
what we did was try to warm them up as best we could ,COMMA put oxygen on them and try to revive them ,COMMA which is difficult to do at <NUM> feet ,COMMA when the tent is freezing .PERIOD 
as i was taking care of these climbers ,COMMA we got a startling experience .PERIOD 
but beck wasn't dead ;SEMICOLON he heard that ,COMMA but he was completely unable to move .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA you go to this one and you see how much more the frontal lobes are lighting up .PERIOD 
he's trying to get his muscles going and get out of this .PERIOD 
it's too cold ;SEMICOLON he can't keep his metabolic fires going ,COMMA and ,COMMA you see ,COMMA there's no more red here ;SEMICOLON his brain is quieting down .PERIOD 
he's thinking about what he's got to do to save himself .PERIOD 
he's not thinking about his family now ,COMMA and he's getting himself motivated .PERIOD 
a helicopter came in at <NUM> feet and carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history .PERIOD 
it's our trailer ,COMMA because i know ,COMMA obviously you guys are busy ,COMMA many of you may not have had a chance to see it .PERIOD 
if we could roll ?QUESTIONMARK 
michael moriarty's wife :COLON it's really hard for him to not have his dad .PERIOD 
they're shooting at me .PERIOD 
deborah scranton :COLON thank you .PERIOD 
we were one of the lucky ones to get in the class with the sony cameras and the vista software .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA we were there for an hour ,COMMA talking .PERIOD 
and it really highlighted something that i would like to ask you guys to think about and hopefully to help with ,COMMA which is ,COMMA i think a lot of us are very afraid to have conversations about war ,COMMA and about politics .PERIOD 
how do we open it up to really be able to have a conversation ?QUESTIONMARK 
it was mass casualties .PERIOD 
this is blood .PERIOD 
five soldiers filmed the entire time .PERIOD 
they spent their entire day outside the wire trying to save iraqi lives - the iraqis who work on the post .PERIOD 
and for me ,COMMA it's trying to bridge that disconnect .PERIOD 
i get - i'm often asked ,COMMA you know ,COMMA for me ,COMMA what have been some of the special moments from having worked on this film .PERIOD 
and he looked at me ,COMMA and i smiled ,COMMA and then i saw the tears start welling up in his eyes .PERIOD 
so when i talk about a disconnect ,COMMA it's not only for maybe those people who don't know a soldier ,COMMA which there obviously are .PERIOD you know ,COMMA these days ,COMMA it's not like world war ii ,COMMA where there was a war front and a home front ,COMMA and everybody seemed involved .PERIOD 
do you give money to any of the charities ?QUESTIONMARK 
do you really care ?QUESTIONMARK 
and it was something called ecorock .PERIOD 
and they worked absolutely very ,COMMA very ,COMMA very hard .PERIOD 
that's the finished production line there .PERIOD 
we must change everything .PERIOD 
so let's first talk about focused ultrasound .PERIOD 
and i hold in my hand a tissue-mimicking phantom .PERIOD 
it is transparent ,COMMA made just for you .PERIOD 
this is a setup i put in a physics lab .PERIOD 
we need to reach a target inside the brain .PERIOD 
but you may not know that he tried to perform lobotomies in the brain ,COMMA noninvasively ,COMMA with focused ultrasound in the <NUM> .PERIOD 
and it makes you ponder why those pioneers failed .PERIOD 
they were missing the vision .PERIOD 
it is approved under an fdaide at the university of virginia in charlottesville using focused ultrasound to ablate a point in his thalamus .PERIOD 
we attach a transducer ,COMMA in this case ,COMMA to the brain ,COMMA but if it will be a different organ ,COMMA it will be a different transducer attached to the patient .PERIOD 
it's a target in the thalamus .PERIOD 
it doesn't do any damage ,COMMA but it elevates the temperature by a few degrees .PERIOD 
but here we can get both the anatomical imaging and the temperature maps in real time .PERIOD 
so once the physician verifies that the focus spot is on the target he has chosen ,COMMA then we move to perform a full-energy ablation like you see here .PERIOD 
and you have to understand what is in people's mind when they are willing to take the risk .PERIOD 
they drove like three hours from their farm to the hospital .PERIOD 
so again ,COMMA this is an immediate relief .PERIOD 
i don't see ,COMMA without this nation taking it as some collective will or something that is a national goal to make that happen ,COMMA it will not happen .PERIOD 
and it's not just because of regulation ;SEMICOLON it's because of the amount of money needed under the current evidence-based medicine and the size of trials and so on to make it happen .PERIOD 
and we have better-than-surgery results in breasts .PERIOD 
women suffer from that disease .PERIOD 
in the fashion industry ,COMMA there's very little intellectual property protection .PERIOD 
it's because it's a lot harder for knock-off artists to knock off these designs because they can't knock off the logo .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the reason for this ,COMMA the reason that the fashion industry doesn't have any copyright protection is because the courts decided long ago that apparel is too utilitarian to qualify for copyright protection .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA fashion designers have the broadest palette imaginable in this creative industry .PERIOD 
people think this is a magical thing .PERIOD how does it happen ?QUESTIONMARK 
johanna blakley :COLON imagine that .PERIOD 
they make deals with the fast fashion giants and they come up with a way to sell their product to a whole new demographic :COLON the santee alley demographic .PERIOD 
very low novelty standard ,COMMA anybody can register anything .PERIOD 
that is a very difficult question to answer .PERIOD 
fireworks displays ,COMMA the rules of games ,COMMA the smell of perfume :COLON no .PERIOD 
it is more complex than this ,COMMA but this will do .PERIOD 
the problem is that digital technology has completely subverted the logic of this physically fixed ,COMMA expression versus idea concept .PERIOD 
this individual lives in the atacama desert in chile ,COMMA and it happens to be <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
and i'm also trying to create a means in which to step outside our quotidian experience of time and to start to consider a deeper timescale .PERIOD 
i'd been traveling in japan without an agenda other than to photograph ,COMMA and then i heard about this tree that is <NUM> years old and knew that i had to go visit it .PERIOD 
this is a clonal tree as well .PERIOD 
i spoke to the biologist who discovered this tree ,COMMA and he told me that that spindly growth you see there in the center is most likely a product of climate change .PERIOD 
does anybody know how old the oldest tortoise is - any guesses ?QUESTIONMARK 
and then ,COMMA you might have heard of this giant clam that was discovered off the coast of northern iceland that reached <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
however ,COMMA it died in the lab as they were determining its age .PERIOD 
i had the opportunity to travel around the limpopo province in south africa with an expert in baobab trees .PERIOD 
they contain thousands of years of their own histories within themselves ,COMMA and they also contain records of natural and human events .PERIOD 
and it actually never sheds those leaves ,COMMA so it also bears the distinction of having the longest leaves in the plant kingdom .PERIOD 
this is something called an underground forest .PERIOD 
the tree can easily recover .PERIOD 
but what's unique about it is that it's doing dna repair below freezing .PERIOD 
it's my hope that ,COMMA by going to find these organisms ,COMMA that i can help draw attention to their remarkable resilience and help play a part in insuring their continued longevity into the foreseeable future .PERIOD 
our leaders and ourselves want everything ,COMMA but we don't talk about the costs .PERIOD 
and when we would gather as fellows ,COMMA she would push us to think about how the elders in native american culture make decisions .PERIOD 
they said they would try so hard to remember the fragments of the dance ,COMMA hoping that others were alive and doing the same .PERIOD 
but we find those entrepreneurs who put people and the planet before profit .PERIOD 
and it's only when we honor them and celebrate them and give them status that the world will really change .PERIOD 
for two years ,COMMA he hardly made any money ,COMMA a tiny stipend ,COMMA but he apprenticed with this incredible housing developer named tasneem saddiqui .PERIOD 
he said ,COMMA long story .PERIOD 
we can take the easier road ,COMMA the more cynical road ,COMMA which is a road based on sometimes dreams of a past that never really was ,COMMA a fear of each other ,COMMA distancing and blame .PERIOD 
i had the great honor of working with the child psychologist dr. robert coles ,COMMA who stood up for change during the civil rights movement in the united states .PERIOD 
my final story is about a young ,COMMA beautiful man named josephat byaruhanga ,COMMA who was another acumen fund fellow ,COMMA who hails from uganda ,COMMA a farming community .PERIOD 
and we placed him in a company in western kenya ,COMMA just <NUM> miles away .PERIOD 
and he said to me at the end of his year ,COMMA jacqueline ,COMMA it was so humbling ,COMMA because i thought as a farmer and as an african i would understand how to transcend culture .PERIOD 
robert kennedy once said that few of us have the greatness to bend history itself ,COMMA but each of us can work to change a small portion of events .PERIOD 
but we do not know his face .PERIOD 
i find that hard to believe .PERIOD 
it also has to be sufficiently detailed .PERIOD 
all we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self-portrait ,COMMA and look ,COMMA they are very similar .PERIOD 
they are made in the right order .PERIOD 
it has stored ,COMMA recorded ,COMMA can fastly retrieve the meanings of thousands ,COMMA tens of thousands of objects ,COMMA actions ,COMMA and their relationships in the world .PERIOD 
now movement has advanced to the point where it can actually control movement simultaneously ,COMMA in a complex sequence ,COMMA in complex ways as would be required for example for playing a complicated game ,COMMA like soccer .PERIOD 
you could go out into the community in monterey ,COMMA and you'd have difficulty finding a boy that has this ability .PERIOD 
and in fact they result in a wonderful differentiation in humankind ,COMMA in the way that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA no two of us are quite alike .PERIOD 
and we try to track the changes that occur as the new skill or ability is acquired .PERIOD 
from these studies we defined two great epochs of the plastic history of the brain .PERIOD 
and that is the period in which the brain is setting up in its initial form its basic processing machinery .PERIOD 
and i see the brain actually develop a processor that is specialized - specialized for that complex array ,COMMA a repertoire of sounds .PERIOD 
he's successful in his retrieval of food with this tool every time .PERIOD 
we can look down in the brain of the monkey .PERIOD 
we've actually distorted the map by the exercise .PERIOD 
and each one of them changes in ways that are specific to the skill or ability .PERIOD 
it represents changes of hundreds of millions ,COMMA possibly billions of synaptic connections in your brain .PERIOD 
that is why you ,COMMA in your many skills and abilities ,COMMA are a unique specialist :COLON a specialist that's vastly different in your physical brain in detail than the brain of an individual <NUM> years ago ;SEMICOLON enormously different in the details from the brain of the average individual <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
it's not english .PERIOD it's noisy english .PERIOD 
changing it in detail .PERIOD it takes about <NUM> hours on the average .PERIOD 
you can see that most of the children on the left side of the distribution are moving into the middle or the right .PERIOD 
this is a substantially large impact .PERIOD 
i'm specifically interested in things like autism ,COMMA and cerebral palsy ,COMMA these great childhood catastrophes .PERIOD 
but also in your future is brain aerobics .PERIOD 
get ready for it .PERIOD it's going to be a part of every life not too far in the future ,COMMA just like physical exercise is a part of every well organized life in the contemporary period .PERIOD 
of course a lot of people will ignore this advice .PERIOD 
and one of the stories he told me so often when i was a young boy was of the first british atomic bomb test .PERIOD 
what he was trying to do with me was to inspire me to protect the world ,COMMA and show me just how fragile the world is .PERIOD 
i love the place .PERIOD 
fresh water freezes at zero .PERIOD 
i remember just trying to get out of the water .PERIOD 
and for a swimmer ,COMMA you need to feel your hands because you need to be able to grab the water and pull it through with you .PERIOD 
we are going to actually have to take them off .PERIOD 
and i remember looking into the ice ,COMMA and there were big chunks of white ice in there ,COMMA and the water was completely black .PERIOD 
it's a very frightening ,COMMA very ,COMMA very frightening thought .PERIOD 
it's all a little bit frightening ,COMMA and emotional .PERIOD 
the first thing we need to do is we need to break this problem down into manageable chunks .PERIOD 
i've just come back from giving a series of speeches in some of the poorest townships in south africa to young children as young as <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
we need to believe in ourselves .PERIOD 
but the most important thing we must do is ,COMMA i think ,COMMA we must all walk to the end of our lives and turn around ,COMMA and ask ourselves a most fundamental question .PERIOD 
you take about eight or so carbon atoms ,COMMA about <NUM> hydrogen atoms ,COMMA you put them together in exactly the right way and you get this marvelous liquid :COLON very energy-dense and very easy to refine into a number of very useful products and fuels .PERIOD 
but what about oil ?QUESTIONMARK where is it in the energy system ?QUESTIONMARK 
and that continues into the future with the renewables that we're developing today ,COMMA reaching maybe <NUM> percent of primary energy by mid century .PERIOD 
i picked it up outside of marble falls ,COMMA texas .PERIOD 
and it's different than this limestone ,COMMA you can see that .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA millions of abalone every year make this shell .PERIOD 
it's the same stuff as this and the same stuff as this .PERIOD 
and why ?QUESTIONMARK because the lowly abalone is able to lay down the calcium carbonate crystals in layers ,COMMA making this beautiful ,COMMA iridescent mother of pearl .PERIOD 
very specialized material that the abalone self-assembles ,COMMA millions of abalone ,COMMA all the time ,COMMA every day ,COMMA every year .PERIOD 
how the molecules are put together .PERIOD 
here's a piece of coal .PERIOD 
no wonder that most of the most important international operators in germany ,COMMA but also in france and the uk and scandinavia ,COMMA everywhere ,COMMA systematically bribed .PERIOD 
they are not as good at bribing as many of their international competitors are ,COMMA but they were not allowed to show their strengths ,COMMA because the world was eaten up by grand corruption .PERIOD 
in the first session - we had three sessions over the course of two years .PERIOD 
they even applaud it .PERIOD 
the world bank has turned from saulus to paulus ;SEMICOLON under wolfensohn ,COMMA they became ,COMMA i would say ,COMMA the strongest anti-corruption agency in the world .PERIOD 
they have to have a much more transparent financial governance .PERIOD 
and that's what it's about .PERIOD 
we use portraiture as a way to deliver those lives ,COMMA but that's it .PERIOD 
and i thought really what we need is an elders program to just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk .PERIOD 
that's barbara walters and others like that ,COMMA and we like that .PERIOD 
and he had never appeared in public since that point .PERIOD 
and she said ,COMMA well ,COMMA something very weird was happening .PERIOD 
i didn't know what was going on ,COMMA but i was so part of the process of getting that out .PERIOD 
these were people through their <NUM> .PERIOD 
but after the interview ,COMMA i got a call ,COMMA very gruff voice ,COMMA from a woman .PERIOD 
never ever get up on a stage with somebody who's modest ,COMMA because all of these people have been assembled to listen to them ,COMMA and they sit there and they say ,COMMA aw ,COMMA shucks ,COMMA it was an accident .PERIOD 
the worst interview i ever did :COLON william l. shirer .PERIOD 
and she stonewalled me .PERIOD it was unbelievable .PERIOD 
that's the problem here ,COMMA and she's fighting me for that ,COMMA and so then i asked her a question - i didn't know how i was going to get out of it - i asked her a question about her days as a playwright ,COMMA and again ,COMMA characteristically ,COMMA instead of saying ,COMMA oh yes ,COMMA i was a playwright ,COMMA and this is what blah blah blah ,COMMA she said ,COMMA oh ,COMMA playwright .PERIOD everybody knows i was a playwright .PERIOD 
she wanted the control of her final moment ,COMMA and she did it amazingly .PERIOD 
his father was an sob ,COMMA and ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA he was another comedian with an unhappy childhood ,COMMA but then we were off and running .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA some of you will know him ,COMMA most of you won't ,COMMA dumas malone .PERIOD 
and here is this man who had given his whole life to uncovering jefferson and connecting with him ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA well .PERIOD - i'm going to do a bad southern accent .PERIOD 
i have a story ,COMMA a story that i would like to share with you .PERIOD 
and it's an african story .PERIOD 
and so maybe you're thinking now ,COMMA why ,COMMA how ,COMMA an italian filmmaker based in boston is so interested in this story ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i was born in zambia .PERIOD 
i have the good fortune of being a filmmaker-in-residence at the center of digital imaging arts at boston university .PERIOD 
there are several themes from the documentary ,COMMA but they are re-edited and made for you ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
milverton nwokedi :COLON you cut a nice movie with just <NUM> dollars in nigeria here .PERIOD

kevin books ikeduba :COLON what i'm scared of is just the explosion will come up in my face .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA this is nollywood ,COMMA where the magic lives .PERIOD 
but always with a smile ,COMMA always with an enthusiasm ,COMMA that is incredible .PERIOD 
the nigerian filmmakers really ,COMMA really ,COMMA are doing what they like .PERIOD 
and so it's a very ,COMMA very important thing for them ,COMMA and for their audiences .PERIOD 
filmmakers ,COMMA friends of mine ,COMMA they look at nollywood and they say ,COMMA wow ,COMMA they are doing what we really want to do ,COMMA and make a buck and live with this job .PERIOD 
no stories around the campfire .PERIOD 
difficult ,COMMA eh ?QUESTIONMARK it's meaningless .PERIOD 
i think that the key to a healthy society is a thriving community of storytellers ,COMMA and i think that the nigerian filmmakers really have proved this .PERIOD 
it ’ s not an added sequence ,COMMA just some voices from nollywood .PERIOD 
and we know that there are more .PERIOD 
they can be rented for pennies .PERIOD 
you can be in a lagos traffic jam and you can buy a movie or some bananas or some water .PERIOD yes .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA it appeared in a porno comic book ,COMMA which is the slide on the right .PERIOD 
on the left-hand side ,COMMA i had the context of those little houses ,COMMA and i tried to build a building that fit into that context .PERIOD 
and then i did a law school for loyola in downtown l.a .PERIOD 
and it was my theory ,COMMA or my point of view ,COMMA that one didn't upstage the neighborhood - one made accommodations .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA the story i tell is that i got mad at postmodernism - at po-mo - and said that fish were <NUM> million years earlier than man ,COMMA and if you're going to go back ,COMMA we might as well go back to the beginning .PERIOD 
and so i started making these funny things .PERIOD 
and the client said ,COMMA why no fish ?QUESTIONMARK 
it was a dialog with the context again .PERIOD 
couldn't find it .PERIOD 
so .PERIOD 
and it's one of the nicest pieces i've ever made ,COMMA i think .PERIOD 
for reasons we don't want to talk about ,COMMA it got delayed .PERIOD 
i went around toronto and found a bathtub like my grandmother's ,COMMA and i put the fish in .PERIOD 
and we've started to work on things .PERIOD 
the highlight of the performance was at the end .PERIOD 
and so i did a lot of dirty things with chain link ,COMMA which nobody will forgive me for .PERIOD 
it's in perspective and everything .PERIOD 
but we were trying to collide our ideas ,COMMA to put objects next to each other .PERIOD 
like a morandi - like the little bottles - composing them like a still life .PERIOD 
and he pushed that .PERIOD 
and it was this interaction between that kind of ,COMMA up-the-ante stuff that became pretty interesting .PERIOD 
and i still think the time magazine picture will be of the binoculars ,COMMA you know ,COMMA leaving out the - what the hell .PERIOD 
i said ,COMMA if i can't get the craft that i want ,COMMA i'll use the craft i can get .PERIOD 
and it was all of one material ,COMMA and the metal could go on the roof as well as the walls .PERIOD 
i was given an opportunity to design an exhibit for the metalworkers' unions of america and canada in washington ,COMMA and i did it on the condition that they become my partners in the future and help me with all future metal buildings ,COMMA etc .PERIOD etc .PERIOD 
and then more metal and some chain link in santa monica - a little shopping center .PERIOD 
it gave me an opportunity to make a sculpture out of it .PERIOD 
when you have to do something really cheaply ,COMMA it's hard to get perfect corners and stuff .PERIOD 
he didn't recommend me ,COMMA by the way .PERIOD 
i keep trying to make it work .PERIOD 
it's never been finished .PERIOD 
this is the city hall over here somewhere ,COMMA and the courthouse .PERIOD 
sohio is on the axis here ,COMMA and we followed the axis ,COMMA and they're two kind of goalposts .PERIOD 
and all this stuff at the bottom is a museum ,COMMA and an idea for a very fancy automobile entry .PERIOD 
and following that basic idea of the village ,COMMA we changed it as we got into it .PERIOD 
that's the living room .PERIOD 
you come down from this level along the stairway ,COMMA and you enter the bedroom here ,COMMA going into the lake .PERIOD 
these stonehenge things were designed to give foreground and to create a greater depth in this shallow lot .PERIOD 
i was trying to get around this plan coupe - how do you do it ?QUESTIONMARK 
jay chiat is a glutton for punishment ,COMMA and he hired me to do a house for him in the hamptons .PERIOD 
and then this is a kind of a shopping mall ,COMMA with a rodeo and restaurants .PERIOD 
it has a chamber hall .PERIOD 
there's commercial at the ground floor .PERIOD 
the acoustician in the competition gave us criteria ,COMMA which led to this compartmentalized scheme ,COMMA which we found out after the competition would not work at all .PERIOD 
and the ritz-carlton tower is being designed with exposed steel ,COMMA non-fire proof ,COMMA much like those old gas tanks .PERIOD 
and the food wasn't as good as the stuff ,COMMA and so it failed .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
i know bill joy was talking to you about the wonders of carbon nanotubes ,COMMA so i'm going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro-tubes ,COMMA which is charcoal .PERIOD 
what we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel that would be something that people could easily cook with ,COMMA something like charcoal .PERIOD 
after some time ,COMMA after setting it on fire ,COMMA you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln ,COMMA and then you end up with this carbonized material here .PERIOD 
however ,COMMA you can't burn this .PERIOD it's too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking .PERIOD 
so we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes .PERIOD 
compared to the sugarcane charcoal ,COMMA where we actually have to teach people how to form it into briquettes and you have the extra step of cooking the binder ,COMMA this comes pre-briquetted .PERIOD 
but this is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits .PERIOD 
they can generate income from this .PERIOD 
they can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal ,COMMA and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who aren't making their own .PERIOD 
i mean the world where advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles that are made by hand ,COMMA and where ,COMMA when you work <NUM> hours a day ,COMMA you're still only earning <NUM> dollars in a month .PERIOD 
and more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day .PERIOD 
do you need to find entrepreneurs ,COMMA or venture capitalists ,COMMA or what do you need to take what you've got and get it to scale ?QUESTIONMARK 
these are some of my kids with a salad bar .PERIOD 
and the very first thing was about regional food - trying to eat food from within our region .PERIOD 
we can't keep feeding our kids pesticides and herbicides and antibiotics and hormones .PERIOD 
the usda allows these antibiotics ,COMMA these hormones and these pesticides in our food supply ,COMMA and the usda paid for this ad in time magazine .PERIOD 
it's no wonder ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we have criminals .PERIOD 
what goes in is what we are .PERIOD 
the cdc ,COMMA the center for disease control ,COMMA has said ,COMMA of the children born in the year <NUM> - those seven- and eight-year-olds today - one out of every three caucasians ,COMMA one out of every two african-americans and hispanics are going to have diabetes in their lifetime .PERIOD 
and it's because of what we feed them .PERIOD 
this is the usda portion size ,COMMA that little ,COMMA tiny thing .PERIOD 
in case you can't tell ,COMMA that's ,COMMA like ,COMMA pink danish and some kind of cupcakes .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA this may be what a lot of parents serve ,COMMA as opposed to - this is what we try and serve .PERIOD 
there's not a strawberry tree or a carrot bush .PERIOD 
you're not going to get the next generation ,COMMA or the generation after ,COMMA to be able to think like this if they're not nourished .PERIOD 
and these calendars really started to lay out my program .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA we have to change it .PERIOD 
we have to teach kids that if they're on a diet of refined sugar ,COMMA they go up and down ,COMMA just like if they're on a diet of crack .PERIOD 
and we have to pull it all together .PERIOD we have composting in all of our schools .PERIOD 
because ,COMMA you know what ,COMMA many of us are sort of at the end of our careers ,COMMA and we need to be giving these kids - these young kids ,COMMA the next generation - the tools to save themselves and save the planet .PERIOD 
i had <NUM> employees .PERIOD 
in this country ,COMMA we're spending <NUM> billion dollars a year on fast food .PERIOD 
that <NUM> billion comes down to two dollars and <NUM> cents - that's what the government allocates for lunch .PERIOD 
and those are the same kids who are going to be getting sick .PERIOD 
look how odd he looks with the eyebrows missing .PERIOD 
max has kindly donated his photograph to me .PERIOD 
our research has shown that the parents and close loved ones of these children adore them .PERIOD 
we crave the approval of our peers .PERIOD 
i'd like you all in the audience now to push your lower jaw forward .PERIOD 
people know now that i'm enthusiastic ,COMMA that i'm a happy person .PERIOD 
he maintained a calm insouciance .PERIOD 
we can categorize it like that .PERIOD 
because you might say ,COMMA well ,COMMA this type of surgery might be regarded as cosmetic .PERIOD 
i'll move it off ,COMMA and we'll have a blank slide for those who are squeamish amongst you .PERIOD 
and again ,COMMA as i told you ,COMMA if they have a caring family and good work life ,COMMA then they can lead normal and fulfilled lives .PERIOD 
so it's not simply a western phenomenon .PERIOD 
we make judgments on people's faces all the time .PERIOD 
good-looking people are always judged as being more friendly .PERIOD 
this is an image of ann who's had her right jaw removed and the base of her skull removed .PERIOD 
so it's very valuable to have that tool in our armamentarium .PERIOD 
but the patients are going to have to take drugs that suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives .PERIOD 
we're still not curing enough patients - it's the most disfiguring cancer .PERIOD 
we still can't get rid of scars .PERIOD 
whereas i felt that when you design ,COMMA you either improve or you create a detriment to the community in which you're designing in .PERIOD 
working within the united states ,COMMA most people look at poverty and they see the face of a foreigner ,COMMA but go live - i live in bozeman ,COMMA montana - go up to the north plains on the reservations ,COMMA or go down to alabama or mississippi pre-katrina ,COMMA and i could have shown you places that have far worse conditions than many developing countries i've been to .PERIOD 
so in the past seven years - this isn't just about nonprofit .PERIOD 
what it showed me is that there's a grassroots movement going on of socially responsible designers who really believe that this world has got a lot smaller ,COMMA and that we have the opportunity - not the responsibility ,COMMA but the opportunity - to really get involved in making change .PERIOD 
so it's really important that if we're designing and trying to create change ,COMMA we build that change .PERIOD 
and it wasn't doctors telling us this ;SEMICOLON it was actual villagers that we were staying with .PERIOD 
we just don't know how to show this .PERIOD 
and on the fourth week ,COMMA the doctors come and they mow out an area ,COMMA put a tensile structure on the top and when the doctors have finished treating and seeing patients and villagers ,COMMA you cut down the clinic and you eat it .PERIOD it's an eat your own clinic .PERIOD 
and you have to keep the maintenance down .PERIOD 
so this is the designer .PERIOD he's out there working with the first ever women's soccer team in kwa-zulu natal ,COMMA siyathemba ,COMMA and they can tell it better .PERIOD 
video :COLON well ,COMMA my name is sisi ,COMMA because i work at the african center .PERIOD 
this was a connection ,COMMA just a meeting with somebody who wanted to develop africa's first telemedicine center ,COMMA in tanzania .PERIOD 
this is a 370-dollar shelter that can be easily assembled .PERIOD 
designing housing .PERIOD this house is going to go in in a couple of weeks .PERIOD 
we put together very quickly a washroom .PERIOD 
this is shandra and the calhouns .PERIOD they're photographers who have documented the lower ninth for the last <NUM> years .PERIOD 
one billion people live in abject poverty .PERIOD 
if we do nothing about the housing crisis that's about to happen ,COMMA in <NUM> years ,COMMA one in three people will live in an unplanned settlement or a refugee camp .PERIOD look left ,COMMA look right :COLON one of you will be there .PERIOD 
and i want this whole thing to work multi-lingually .PERIOD 
the idea of needs-based competitions - x-prize for the other <NUM> percent ,COMMA if you want to call it that .PERIOD 
we also want to look at ways of matchmaking and putting funding partners together .PERIOD 
there should be a sheet .PERIOD i don't have time to read this ,COMMA because i'm going to be yanked off .PERIOD 
so i'm going to speak about a problem that i have and that's that i'm a philosopher .PERIOD 
and i get hoots of derision and cackles and growls because they think ,COMMA that's impossible !EXCLAMATIONMARK you can't explain consciousness .PERIOD 
my late ,COMMA lamented friend bob nozick ,COMMA a fine philosopher ,COMMA in one of his books ,COMMA philosophical explanations ,COMMA is commenting on the ethos of philosophy - the way philosophers go about their business .PERIOD 
i'm sure that people here who work on ,COMMA say ,COMMA climate change and global warming ,COMMA or on the future of the internet ,COMMA encounter people who have very strong opinions about what's going to happen next .PERIOD 
but with regard to consciousness ,COMMA people seem to think ,COMMA each of us seems to think ,COMMA i am an expert .PERIOD 
no other ingredients at all .PERIOD we're just made of cells ,COMMA about <NUM> trillion of them .PERIOD 
the content - there's color ,COMMA there's ideas ,COMMA there's memories ,COMMA there's history .PERIOD and somehow all that content of consciousness is accomplished by the busy activity of those hoards of neurons .PERIOD 
so this is the problem .PERIOD so i have to do a little bit of the sort of work that a lot of you won't like ,COMMA for the same reason that you don't like to see a magic trick explained to you .PERIOD 
it's one that i predicted in the last page or two of my <NUM> book ,COMMA consciousness explained ,COMMA where i said if you did experiments of this sort ,COMMA you'd find that people were unable to pick up really large changes .PERIOD 
and as i walked towards the picture ,COMMA i was expecting detail that wasn't there .PERIOD 
you're familiar with a more recent technology ,COMMA which is - there ,COMMA you can get a better view of the blobs .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA what does your brain do when it takes the suggestion ?QUESTIONMARK 
i don't think so .PERIOD not a chance .PERIOD but then ,COMMA how on earth is it done ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's the same thing .PERIOD 
the brain isn't actually putting the detail in your head at all .PERIOD 
is the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right ,COMMA rotated ?QUESTIONMARK 
yes .PERIOD 
and if you read that literature ,COMMA one of the things that you really have to come to terms with is even when you're the subject in the experiment ,COMMA you don't know .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA that's where you have to go backstage and ask the magician .PERIOD 
how many of you see that sort of boundary ,COMMA with the necker cube floating in front of the circles ?QUESTIONMARK 
can you see it ?QUESTIONMARK 
when you see the cube one way ,COMMA behind the screen ,COMMA those boundaries go away .PERIOD 
and i supposed that that was just a flat truth ,COMMA always true .PERIOD 
let me just pause this for a second if i can .PERIOD 
so now we're going to be subjects in the experiment .PERIOD 
audience :COLON yes .PERIOD 
so <NUM> seconds is the median time for subjects in his experiment there .PERIOD 
how many still don't see it ?QUESTIONMARK how many still don't see it ?QUESTIONMARK 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
and i ever met more humble people .PERIOD 
the mosque where the respectful foreigner is showered with blessings and with tears ,COMMA and welcomed as a gift .PERIOD 
what do we know about the women <NUM> years after the war ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA the thesis of the bottom billion is that a billion people have been stuck living in economies that have been stagnant for <NUM> years ,COMMA and hence diverging from the rest of mankind .PERIOD 
the last time the rich world got serious about developing another region was in the late <NUM> .PERIOD 
yes ,COMMA you tear up the eleventh commandment - national sovereignty .PERIOD 
we need to be at least as serious as we were then .PERIOD 
the commodity booms are pumping unprecedented amounts of money into many ,COMMA though not all ,COMMA of the countries of the bottom billion .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA a mass of new discoveries .PERIOD 
just to give you one example :COLON angola alone is getting <NUM> billion dollars a year in oil revenue .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA here comes a bit of science ,COMMA and this is a bit of science i've done since the bottom billion ,COMMA so it's new .PERIOD 
come back <NUM> years later .PERIOD 
you know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment ,COMMA how they've been sold over the last <NUM> years ?QUESTIONMARK 
a company flies in ,COMMA does a deal with a minister .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
i was an unlikely person to be doing this .PERIOD 
i never studied sculpture ,COMMA engineering or architecture .PERIOD 
it's a self-portrait titled wide hips .PERIOD 
returning to india to work with those fishermen ,COMMA we made a net of a million and a half hand-tied knots - installed briefly in madrid .PERIOD 
my life was not going to be the same .PERIOD 
next challenge ,COMMA the biennial of the americas in denver asked ,COMMA could i represent the <NUM> nations of the western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture ?QUESTIONMARK 
i read about the recent earthquake in chile and the tsunami that rippled across the entire pacific ocean .PERIOD 
i started my journey <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
and that also brought me to the fact that this poses such a risk to our society .PERIOD 
and together they only form about <NUM> years of supply .PERIOD 
but now ,COMMA we have a real technology to do this .PERIOD 
when they control their brain ,COMMA they can control their pain .PERIOD 
when you do ,COMMA what do you want to control ?QUESTIONMARK 
you will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself ,COMMA all your experiences .PERIOD 
these are some of the areas we're working on today that i don't have time to go into in detail .PERIOD 
but i want to leave with you the big question .PERIOD 
we are the first generation that's going to be able to enter into ,COMMA using this technology ,COMMA the human mind and brain .PERIOD 
what is worth dying for ?QUESTIONMARK 
we know that it's possible to live in a failed state ,COMMA where everything that can go wrong does go wrong - where mothers cannot feed their children ,COMMA where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration ,COMMA where people are murdered indiscriminately .PERIOD 
for instance ,COMMA there are <NUM> states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal ,COMMA where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board ,COMMA hard ,COMMA and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin .PERIOD 
but we can ask the obvious question :COLON is it a good idea ,COMMA generally speaking ,COMMA to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior ?QUESTIONMARK 
now ,COMMA many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined ,COMMA and seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed .PERIOD 
when this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably <NUM> .PERIOD 
does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition .PERIOD 
many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of no exceptions .PERIOD 
and yet ,COMMA chess is a domain of perfect objectivity .PERIOD 
but what does voluntary mean in a community where ,COMMA when a girl gets raped ,COMMA her father's first impulse ,COMMA rather often ,COMMA is to murder her out of shame ?QUESTIONMARK 
just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute :COLON your daughter gets raped ,COMMA and what you want to do is kill her .PERIOD 
but if we are in a reflective mood ,COMMA we can ask ,COMMA is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies ?QUESTIONMARK 
whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded .PERIOD 
paint your picture of what rolling the clock <NUM> years forward ,COMMA <NUM> years forward ,COMMA how you would like to think of the world ,COMMA balancing moral progress with richness .PERIOD 
but again ,COMMA then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context .PERIOD 
sam ,COMMA this is a conversation i would actually love to continue for hours .PERIOD 
we don't have that ,COMMA but maybe another time .PERIOD thank you for coming to ted .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA within zoology ,COMMA i took the course or the discipline of entomology ,COMMA the science of insects .PERIOD 
because biological control phenomenon ,COMMA you can see it in your backyard .PERIOD 
so this phenomenon of natural control exists literally everywhere .PERIOD 
so it's everywhere ,COMMA and we need to know how to exploit it .PERIOD 
insects ,COMMA those six-legged organisms and spiders or mites ,COMMA the eight-legged organisms .PERIOD 
on your right-hand side you can see a cucumber leaf ,COMMA and on the middle ,COMMA cotton leaf ,COMMA and on the left a tomato leaf with these little stipplings .PERIOD 
by the way ,COMMA it's springtime now in israel .PERIOD 
when temperature rises sharply ,COMMA you can see those bad ones ,COMMA those aphids ,COMMA all over the plants ,COMMA in your hibiscus ,COMMA in your lantana ,COMMA in the young ,COMMA fresh foliage of the spring flush ,COMMA so-called .PERIOD 
this is all natural .PERIOD this is all natural .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA we'll start first with the pest :COLON the thrips .PERIOD 
this is a sweet pepper which is not consumable because it is suffering from a viral disease transmitted by those thrip adults .PERIOD 
many different parts .PERIOD 
by the way ,COMMA they have a very nice landscape - you see the jordanian mountains on the one hand and the jordan valley on the other hand ,COMMA and a good ,COMMA mild winter and a nice ,COMMA hot summer ,COMMA which is an excellent condition to mass-produce those creatures .PERIOD 
here we come with those natural enemies in order to reverse a little bit of the wheel and to bring more natural balance to the agricultural plot by reducing those chemicals .PERIOD 
in this table ,COMMA you can actually see what is an impact of a successful biological control by good bugs .PERIOD 
but if we go ,COMMA for example ,COMMA to this place ,COMMA southeast israel ,COMMA the arava area above the great rift valley ,COMMA where the really top-notch - the pearl of the israeli agriculture is located ,COMMA especially under greenhouse conditions ,COMMA or under screenhouse conditions - if you drive all the way to eilat ,COMMA you see this just in the middle of the desert .PERIOD 
step by step ,COMMA it does narrow .PERIOD 
so i'm saying it on behalf of all the biocontrol petitioners and implementers ,COMMA in israel and abroad ,COMMA really give nature a chance .PERIOD 
how can we understand what makes some societies more fragile than other societies ?QUESTIONMARK the problem is obviously relevant to our situation today ,COMMA because today as well ,COMMA there are some societies that have already collapsed ,COMMA such as somalia and rwanda and the former yugoslavia .PERIOD there are also societies today that may be close to collapse ,COMMA such as nepal ,COMMA indonesia and columbia .PERIOD 
what is there that we can learn from the past that would help us avoid declining or collapsing in the way that so many past societies have ?QUESTIONMARK 
why did they all end up dead ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA in my five-point framework ,COMMA the first item on the framework is to look for human impacts on the environment :COLON people inadvertently destroying the resource base on which they depend .PERIOD and in the case of the viking norse ,COMMA the vikings inadvertently caused soil erosion and deforestation ,COMMA which was a particular problem for them because they required forests to make charcoal ,COMMA to make iron .PERIOD 
or again ,COMMA the collapse of the soviet union took place within a couple of decades ,COMMA maybe within a decade ,COMMA of the time when the soviet union was at its greatest power .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this is a frequent theme :COLON societies collapse very soon after reaching their peak in power .PERIOD 
and i would expect that ,COMMA if our human civilization carries on ,COMMA then maybe in the next century people will be asking ,COMMA why on earth did these people today in the year <NUM> not see the obvious things that they were doing and take corrective action ?QUESTIONMARK 
one blueprint for trouble ,COMMA making collapse likely ,COMMA is where there is a conflict of interest between the short-term interest of the decision-making elites and the long-term interest of the society as a whole ,COMMA especially if the elites are able to insulate themselves from the consequences of their actions .PERIOD where what's good in the short run for the elite is bad for the society as a whole ,COMMA there's a real risk of the elite doing things that would bring the society down in the long run .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA that's one general conclusion about why societies make bad decisions :COLON conflicts of interest .PERIOD 
instead ,COMMA all the major threats facing us today are problems entirely of our own making .PERIOD and since we made the problems ,COMMA we can also solve the problems .PERIOD that then means that it's entirely in our power to deal with these problems .PERIOD 
so i think i'm actually the first one here - i lead .PERIOD 
and meanwhile ,COMMA i use nonsense ,COMMA as you can see .PERIOD 
this was one of a series called zany afternoons ,COMMA which became a book .PERIOD 
but the zeppelin was the biggest thing that ever moved made by man .PERIOD 
there's moscow ,COMMA shirley .PERIOD hope they speak esperanto !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
those ,COMMA for example ,COMMA are mark iv british tanks from <NUM> .PERIOD 
happy little story ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK 
anybody who was anybody had an apartment there .PERIOD 
it's obviously modeled on the titanic .PERIOD 
i thought i could jazz it up a bit ,COMMA have a little fun with it .PERIOD 
this is the word side of my brain .PERIOD 
and then when it ran ,COMMA a lovely lady ,COMMA an old lady named mrs. edgar rosenberg - if you know that name - called me and said she loved the cover ,COMMA it was so sweet .PERIOD 
pretty elegant .PERIOD nothing like a crash to end a joke .PERIOD that completes my oeuvre .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA i'm going to show you again something about our diets .PERIOD 
there's six million species of insects on this planet ,COMMA six million species .PERIOD 
there was an estimation ,COMMA a conservative estimation ,COMMA a couple of years ago that the u.s. economy benefited by <NUM> billion dollars per year .PERIOD 
small animals eat insects .PERIOD 
and here you see me enjoying a meal with caterpillars ,COMMA locusts ,COMMA bee pupae - delicacies .PERIOD 
you're eating at least <NUM> grams per year .PERIOD 
we're even doing this on purpose .PERIOD 
now the situation in the world is going to change for you and me ,COMMA for everyone on this earth .PERIOD 
there was an fao conference last october that was completely devoted to this .PERIOD 
and we eat quite a lot of it .PERIOD 
in the developing world it's much lower .PERIOD 
so if you would be an entrepreneur ,COMMA what would you do ?QUESTIONMARK 
i gave you at least four arguments in favor .PERIOD 
there are entrepreneurs in the netherlands that produce them ,COMMA and one of them is here in the audience ,COMMA marian peeters ,COMMA who's in the picture .PERIOD 
well in the netherlands ,COMMA we have an innovative minister of agriculture ,COMMA and she puts the insects on the menu in her restaurant in her ministry .PERIOD 
reset the three minutes ,COMMA that's just not fair .PERIOD 
i would still be on my bad hip .PERIOD that was so disappointing .PERIOD 
great !EXCLAMATIONMARK excellent !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
so no ,COMMA suddenly i wasn't averse to butting any geezer off the list .PERIOD 
they were desperate for volunteers because the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was <NUM> .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA next thing you know ,COMMA i had my bright blue volunteer vest ,COMMA i had my photo id ,COMMA and i was fully trained by my 89-year-old boss .PERIOD 
i draped them casually over the chair in the doctor's office .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA i'd like to ask you ,COMMA how would you tell the time if you didn't have an iphone ?QUESTIONMARK 
you know ,COMMA i've always wanted one of these .PERIOD 
and this one ,COMMA this is a replica from a 15th-century device .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA tonight ,COMMA if it's clear you'll be able to see the summer triangle .PERIOD 
step three is identify the star on the front of the device .PERIOD 
he would know what time the sun would rise ,COMMA and what time it would set .PERIOD 
probably not one made of brass .PERIOD he would have one made out of wood ,COMMA or paper .PERIOD and the vast majority of this first computer was a portable device that you could keep in the back of your pocket .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what does the astrolabe inspire ?QUESTIONMARK 
and what we gain with a new technology ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is precision and accuracy .PERIOD 
i'm just going to show you how the robot works .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA even though there is nothing in nature that looks like this ,COMMA really ,COMMA we were inspired by biology and applying the principles of walking to this robot .PERIOD thus it's a biologically inspired robot .PERIOD 
we want to fold up the legs and shoot it up for long-range motion .PERIOD 
we developed our adaptive gait planner .PERIOD 
welcome to romela ,COMMA the robotics mechanisms laboratory at virginia tech .PERIOD 
this robot is an amoeba robot .PERIOD 
robotic air powered hand with elastic ligaments .PERIOD 
we wanted to go tackle this problem in a very different direction .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA for example in iraq ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the war zone ,COMMA there is roadside bombs .PERIOD currently you send these remotely controlled vehicles that are armed .PERIOD 
we actually have a fan club for the robot ,COMMA darwin :COLON dynamic anthropomorphic robot with intelligence .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA based on that success ,COMMA the following year we did the proper mechanical design starting from kinematics .PERIOD 
and thus ,COMMA darwin i was born in <NUM> .PERIOD 
dennis hong :COLON so ,COMMA there is actually a competition called robocup .PERIOD 
we were the very first team in the united states that qualified in the humanoid robocup competition .PERIOD 
we truly believe this is going to be the very first running humanoid robot in the united states .PERIOD so ,COMMA stay tuned .PERIOD 
how do we develop these kinds of ideas ?QUESTIONMARK 
we have a fully autonomous vehicle that can drive into urban environments .PERIOD we won a half a million dollars in the darpa urban challenge .PERIOD 
we also have the world's very first vehicle that can be driven by the blind .PERIOD 
he gave a talk about how education and school kills creativity .PERIOD 
for us roboticists ,COMMA engineers and scientists ,COMMA these tools ,COMMA these are the courses and classes you take in class .PERIOD 
these are all the tools that we need .PERIOD 
bertie county is kind of a prime example in the demise of rural america .PERIOD 
there are more buildings that are empty or in disrepair than occupied and in use .PERIOD 
he was brought in in october <NUM> as the new superintendent to basically fix this broken school system .PERIOD 
so in february of <NUM> ,COMMA dr. zullinger invited us ,COMMA project h design - which is a non-profit design firm that i founded - to come to bertie and to partner with him on the repair of this school district and to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district .PERIOD 
we now call this place home .PERIOD 
but beyond our personal reasons for wanting to be there ,COMMA there is a huge need .PERIOD 
it allows elementary-level students to learn core subjects through game play and activity and running around and screaming and being a kid .PERIOD 
so the first batch of computers are being installed later this summer ,COMMA and we're helping dr. zullinger develop some strategies around how we might connect the classroom and the home to extend learning beyond the school day .PERIOD 
so we thought ,COMMA what if you could bring back shop class ,COMMA but this time orient the projects around things that the community needed ,COMMA and to infuse shop class with a more critical and creative-design-thinking studio process .PERIOD 
so what studio h might offer her is a way to develop skills so that she might give back in the most meaningful way .PERIOD 
so for him ,COMMA studio h offers him a way to develop the skills he will need as an architect ,COMMA everything from drafting to wood and metal construction to how to do research for a client .PERIOD 
and going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors about what kind of food they buy and from where and why - that's a homework assignment .PERIOD 
because ,COMMA when you zoom out that far ,COMMA you lose the ability to view people as humans .PERIOD 
if you are a blind child in india ,COMMA you will very likely have to contend with at least two big pieces of bad news .PERIOD 
so i felt that i needed to do two things .PERIOD 
here's the eye with the opaque lens ,COMMA the opaque lens extracted and an acrylic lens inserted .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA the story holds true even if you have a person who got sight after several years of deprivation .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA the way we study that is ,COMMA let's say we find a child who has light sensitivity .PERIOD 
and we've used this general approach to study many different visual proficiencies ,COMMA but i want to highlight one particular one ,COMMA and that is image parsing into objects .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA any image of the kind that you see on the left ,COMMA be it a real image or a synthetic image ,COMMA it's made up of little regions that you see in the middle column ,COMMA regions of different colors ,COMMA different luminances .PERIOD 
and nobody knows how this integration happens ,COMMA and that's the question we asked with project prakash .PERIOD 
doctor :COLON what are their shapes ?QUESTIONMARK 
doctor :COLON now ?QUESTIONMARK 
so we are creating dylan ,COMMA which is a computational system with an ambitious goal of taking in visual inputs of the same kind that a human child would receive ,COMMA and autonomously discovering :COLON what are the objects in this visual input ?QUESTIONMARK 
here's what a baby-cam video looks like .PERIOD 
what's amazing is that working with such highly degraded input ,COMMA the baby ,COMMA very quickly ,COMMA is able to discover meaning in such input .PERIOD 
even before the ball gets to a place ,COMMA the child is already looking there .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA to summarize :COLON prakash ,COMMA in its five years of existence ,COMMA it's had an impact in multiple areas ,COMMA ranging from basic neuroscience plasticity and learning in the brain ,COMMA to clinically relevant hypotheses like in autism ,COMMA the development of autonomous machine vision systems ,COMMA education of the undergraduate and graduate students ,COMMA and most importantly in the alleviation of childhood blindness .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA he's thinking ,COMMA what am i getting myself into ?QUESTIONMARK 
and he said ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA really .PERIOD you can .PERIOD 
and no disabled person had ever done that - run at a collegiate level .PERIOD 
it was really ,COMMA really hot .PERIOD 
and it's the first - i had just gotten these new sprinting legs that you see in that bio ,COMMA and i didn't realize at that time that the amount of sweating i would be doing in the sock - it actually acted like a lubricant and i'd be ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA pistoning in the socket .PERIOD 
he kept me on the right track .PERIOD 
everyone was taking pictures - what is this girl running on ?QUESTIONMARK 
i'm sitting there ,COMMA like ,COMMA oh ,COMMA my god .PERIOD oh ,COMMA my god .PERIOD 
so they call us out and ,COMMA you know - ladies ,COMMA you have one minute .PERIOD 
and i had to think ,COMMA why did i do this ?QUESTIONMARK 
you know ,COMMA show us more than one set of legs .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA these are my cosmetic legs ,COMMA actually ,COMMA and they're absolutely beautiful .PERIOD 
it has a shock absorber in it so it ,COMMA like ,COMMA shhhh ,COMMA makes this neat sound when you jump around on it .PERIOD all right .PERIOD 
in these .PERIOD 
for me ,COMMA while i'm such a serious athlete on the track ,COMMA i want to be feminine off the track ,COMMA and i think it's so important not to be limited in any capacity ,COMMA whether it's ,COMMA you know ,COMMA your mobility or even fashion .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA i love the fact that i can go in anywhere and pick out what i want - the shoes i want ,COMMA the skirts i want - and i'm hoping to try to bring these over here and make them accessible to a lot of people .PERIOD 
two weeks ago ,COMMA aimee was up for the arthur ashe award at the espys .PERIOD 
they didn't even want to touch that one .PERIOD they just did it .PERIOD 
what we're looking at here is the insidious cost of ringtone piracy .PERIOD 
but now you can find out all about - unfortunately ,COMMA my weight is a little higher than that ,COMMA but - all about what happens .PERIOD 
so i think in terms of the fact that math has been liberated from calculating .PERIOD 
it's the chore .PERIOD 
computers allow us to do that - and this is not a small problem by any means .PERIOD 
that's an amazing amount of human endeavor .PERIOD 
and i'll say ,COMMA hmm ,COMMA not sure .PERIOD i'll think about it roughly .PERIOD 
well one of them is ,COMMA they say ,COMMA you need to get the basics first .PERIOD 
that somehow ,COMMA if you use a computer ,COMMA it's all mindless button-pushing ,COMMA but if you do it by hand ,COMMA it's all intellectual .PERIOD 
might have been <NUM> years ago ,COMMA but it isn't anymore .PERIOD 
why are we using computers to show a student how to solve a problem by hand that the computer should be doing anyway ?QUESTIONMARK 
same principles applied - calculations ,COMMA harder .PERIOD 
so the problem we've really got in math education is not that computers might dumb it down ,COMMA but that we have dumbed-down problems right now .PERIOD 
so if you go through lots of examples ,COMMA you can get the answer ,COMMA you can understand how the basics of the system work better .PERIOD 
so programming is the way i think we should be doing that .PERIOD 
this was an example i built for my daughter .PERIOD 
you can see that this is a very early step into limits and differential calculus and what happens when you take things to an extreme - and very small sides and a very large number of sides .PERIOD 
and yet ,COMMA that's a really important practical view of the world .PERIOD 
it's like the land and the king they're inseparable ,COMMA they are one .PERIOD 
the contract is the same as with real word objects in real world containers .PERIOD 
and finally ,COMMA to pull out all the stops ,COMMA this is a system called urp ,COMMA for urban planners ,COMMA in which we give architects and urban planners back the models that we confiscated when we insisted that they use cad systems .PERIOD 
it projects down digital shadows ,COMMA as you see here .PERIOD 
there are inter-shadowing studies that children can operate ,COMMA even though they don't know anything about urban planning :COLON to move a building ,COMMA you simply reach out your hand and you move the building .PERIOD 
this work is <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
and the great thing about it was that alex was so dedicated to the idea of verisimilitude ,COMMA the idea that the putative <NUM> that we were painting in the film be believable ,COMMA that he allowed us to take on that design work as if it were an r & amp ;SEMICOLON d effort .PERIOD 
and the result is sort of gratifyingly perpetual .PERIOD 
people still reference those sequences in minority report when they talk about new ui design .PERIOD 
these are logistics elements that are scattered across the united states .PERIOD 
this is a system called tamper ,COMMA which is a slightly whimsical look at what the future of editing and media manipulation systems might be .PERIOD 
we'll go over to jacques tati here and grab our blue friend and put him down on the table as well .PERIOD 
let me leave with one final thought ,COMMA and that is that one of the greatest english language writers of the last three decades suggested that great art is always a gift .PERIOD 
can it be for every man ,COMMA or is this just for corporations and movie producers ?QUESTIONMARK 
that's our goal entirely .PERIOD 
so this is the inevitability about it .PERIOD 
i just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig .PERIOD 
it was a wonderful experience .PERIOD 
you can just google it .PERIOD 
as i say in my book ,COMMA i'm jewish in the same way the olive garden is italian .PERIOD 
the first thing i did was i got a stack of bibles .PERIOD 
i had christian bibles .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i wanted to follow that rule .PERIOD 
and there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging .PERIOD 
but it's a big part of the bible ,COMMA so i figured i had to address it .PERIOD 
i wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind .PERIOD 
and i explained my project ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA well ,COMMA i am an adulterer ,COMMA are you going to stone me ?QUESTIONMARK 
they really did a fantastic job .PERIOD 
i wanted it to be about religion in america .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this was very inspiring to me .PERIOD 
i recommend jim wallis and tony campolo .PERIOD 
they're very inspiring leaders ,COMMA even though i disagree with much of what they say .PERIOD 
and i would say ,COMMA but that's crazy .PERIOD 
the key is to pick and choose the right parts .PERIOD 
there's the phrase called cafeteria religion ,COMMA and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way ,COMMA and they'll say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA it's just cafeteria religion .PERIOD 
you're just picking and choosing .PERIOD 
the story starts in kenya in december of <NUM> ,COMMA when there was a disputed presidential election ,COMMA and in the immediate aftermath of that election ,COMMA there was an outbreak of ethnic violence .PERIOD 
and she quickly said ,COMMA it's too much .PERIOD 
and enough people looked at it and found it valuable enough that the programmers who created ushahidi decided they were going to make it open source and turn it into a platform .PERIOD 
and it represents the ability of the world's population to volunteer and to contribute and collaborate on large ,COMMA sometimes global ,COMMA projects .PERIOD 
and once they've done it ,COMMA they can do it again ,COMMA and they could work on getting it better .PERIOD 
even with the sacred printing press ,COMMA we got erotic novels <NUM> years before we got scientific journals .PERIOD 
so before i talk about what is ,COMMA i think ,COMMA the critical difference between lolcats and ushahidi ,COMMA i want to talk about their shared source .PERIOD 
at pick-up time the teachers ,COMMA who have been with your children all day ,COMMA would like you to be there at the appointed hour to take your children back .PERIOD 
late pick-ups went up every week for the next four weeks until they topped out at triple the pre-fine average ,COMMA and then they fluctuated at between double and triple the pre-fine average for the life of the fine .PERIOD 
they were operating with social constraints rather than contractual ones .PERIOD 
it's value created by the participants but enjoyed by society as a whole .PERIOD 
the goals set out by ushahidi are not just to make life better for the participants ,COMMA but to make life better for everyone in the society in which ushahidi is operating .PERIOD 
we've got a choice before us .PERIOD 
and may it run forever ,COMMA because it gives people like me a living .PERIOD 
there were two sundays in between .PERIOD but of course ,COMMA sundays are church days ,COMMA so you don't play on sundays .PERIOD and one day it rained ,COMMA so they all sat around making friends with each other .PERIOD 
and then you worked out your strategy ,COMMA and you came and fought the next day ,COMMA and you went back home again .PERIOD 
take a look :COLON you could play it in the dump with some rocks over there ,COMMA you could play it in a little alley - you couldn't hit square anywhere ,COMMA because the bat hit the wall ;SEMICOLON don't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires .PERIOD 
as you can see ,COMMA you can play anywhere .PERIOD 
and we won this world cup in <NUM> .PERIOD 
and so we allowed multinationals into india .PERIOD 
we cut customs duties ,COMMA we reduced import duties ,COMMA and we got all the multinationals coming in ,COMMA with multinational budgets ,COMMA who looked at per-capita income and got very excited about the possibilities in india ,COMMA and were looking for a vehicle to reach every indian .PERIOD 
but what a game we had ,COMMA m. s. dhoni got it right in the air ,COMMA but misbah-ul-haq ,COMMA what a player .PERIOD 
a massive ,COMMA massive success :COLON india ,COMMA the world tt champions .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it was a different india .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA all of the sudden ,COMMA if you were to bowl a shot - if mumbai were to bowl a shot ,COMMA for example ,COMMA they needn't go to kalbadevi or shivaji park or somewhere to source them ,COMMA they could go to trinidad .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA he played in hyderabad ,COMMA went ,COMMA straight after the game ,COMMA went from the stadium to hyderabad airport ,COMMA sat in a private corporate jet - first refueling in portugal ,COMMA second refueling in brazil ;SEMICOLON he was in west indies in time .PERIOD 
they started going to the cricket to watch shah rukh khan .PERIOD 
for a long time ,COMMA india was this country of poverty ,COMMA dust ,COMMA beggars ,COMMA snake charmers ,COMMA filth ,COMMA delhi belly - people heard delhi belly stories before they came .PERIOD 
hopefully ,COMMA it'll make everyone richer ,COMMA hopefully it'll make the game bigger and hopefully it'll give cricket commentators more time in the business .PERIOD 
we all make decisions every day ;SEMICOLON we want to know what the right thing is to do - in domains from the financial to the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic .PERIOD 
and surely ,COMMA if somebody could really tell us how to do exactly the right thing at all possible times ,COMMA that would be a tremendous gift .PERIOD 
this is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet .PERIOD 
calculating odds would seem to be something rather easy :COLON there are six sides to a die ,COMMA two sides to a coin ,COMMA <NUM> cards in a deck .PERIOD 
it's because the mind recalls words by their first letter .PERIOD 
why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA there are many answers ,COMMA but one answer surely is ,COMMA we see a lot of winners .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK when this couple wins the lottery ,COMMA or ed mcmahon shows up at your door with this giant check - how the hell do you cash things that size ,COMMA i don't know .PERIOD 
when was the last time that you saw extensive interviews with everybody who lost ?QUESTIONMARK 
you can't say to yourself ,COMMA i'm as likely to win as anybody ,COMMA because you're not as likely to win as leroy .PERIOD 
because they had the sense that declining wages are worse than rising wages ,COMMA even when the total amount of wages is higher in the declining period .PERIOD here's another nice example .PERIOD 
here's a $ <NUM> hawaiian vacation package ;SEMICOLON it's now on sale for <NUM> .PERIOD 
this tendency to compare to the past is causing people to pass up the better deal .PERIOD in other words ,COMMA a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA just in case you're not getting it ,COMMA here's a schematic of what happened ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
the difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself ,COMMA i'm not paying twice for the same thing .PERIOD 
nonetheless ,COMMA their predictions are perverted by a comparison that then does not carry through and change their experience .PERIOD 
when you go to buy groceries with it ,COMMA it doesn't go ,COMMA i'm the money saved on the car stereo ,COMMA or ,COMMA i'm the dumb money saved on the car .PERIOD it's money .PERIOD 
and if a drive across town is worth <NUM> bucks ,COMMA it's worth <NUM> bucks no matter what you're saving it on .PERIOD people don't think that way .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA by and large people are enormously impatient .PERIOD 
imagine that you can have <NUM> dollars in a year - that's <NUM> months - or <NUM> dollars in <NUM> months .PERIOD 
this is just a graph showing the results that i just suggested you would show if i gave you time to respond ,COMMA which is ,COMMA people find that the subjective value of <NUM> is higher than the subjective value of <NUM> when they'll be delivered in now or one month ,COMMA respectively - a 30-day delay - but they show the reverse pattern when you push the entire decision off into the future a year .PERIOD 
what causes the bug ?QUESTIONMARK is it the drama of the event - that it's so spectacular ?QUESTIONMARK 
i don't want to say - please ,COMMA i'm going to get quoted somewhere as saying ,COMMA terrorism is fine and we shouldn't be so distressed .PERIOD 
what i'm saying is that ,COMMA surely ,COMMA rationally ,COMMA our distress about things that happen ,COMMA about threats ,COMMA should be roughly proportional to the size of those threats and threats to come .PERIOD 
there's no question .PERIOD 
and so we evolved these responses .PERIOD 
it turns out that the value of buying a lottery ticket is not winning .PERIOD 
that's what you think it is .PERIOD all right ?QUESTIONMARK 
and as a result ,COMMA many people look at economists as stupid people .PERIOD 
it's the sequel to an inconvenient truth ,COMMA and it explores all the solutions that will solve the climate crisis .PERIOD 
or ,COMMA we can scroll through the pages at the bottom .PERIOD 
mike matas :COLON and so throughout the whole book ,COMMA al gore will walk you through and explain the photos .PERIOD 
this photo ,COMMA you can you can even see on an interactive map .PERIOD 
and while it's playing ,COMMA we can pinch and peak back at the page ,COMMA and the movie keeps playing .PERIOD 
this is very strange for me ,COMMA because i ’ m not used to doing this :COLON i usually stand on the other side of the light ,COMMA and now i'm feeling the pressure i put other people into .PERIOD and it's hard .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we ’ ll go with the first piece .PERIOD 
court :COLON i don't want to get rid of you .PERIOD 
boy :COLON look man ,COMMA reading don't feed no one .PERIOD 
boy :COLON arguing with you is a waste of time ,COMMA marcus .PERIOD 
marcus :COLON when a man resorts to profanities ,COMMA it ’ s a sure sign of his inability to express himself .PERIOD 
did you ever move your fuckin' ass from hollywood to go and film something real ?QUESTIONMARK 
the first piece was ,COMMA really ,COMMA there's a young woman talking about nigeria ,COMMA that she has a feeling she'll be happy there .PERIOD 
so that whole thing ,COMMA that whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece .PERIOD 
commander :COLON soldiers ,COMMA you are going to fight a battle ,COMMA so you must get ready and willing to die .PERIOD 
c :COLON success ,COMMA the change is only coming through the barrel of the gun .PERIOD 
i don ’ t remember how we got there .PERIOD 
the injection made us not to have mind .PERIOD 
various voices :COLON you will die !EXCLAMATIONMARK you will die !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
onicha :COLON ezra !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
why you giving these to me ?QUESTIONMARK 
mr. ezra gelehun ,COMMA please stand .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA we don ’ t .PERIOD 
mr. gelehun ,COMMA i'd like to remind you ,COMMA you're not on trial here today .PERIOD 
you are not on trial .PERIOD 
e :COLON so you are a liar .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
in the process of my research ,COMMA i actually spent a bit of time in sierra leone researching this .PERIOD 
i met psychosocial workers who worked with them .PERIOD 
frank gehry :COLON i listened to this scientist this morning .PERIOD 
i mean it is astonishing for an artist ,COMMA for an architect ,COMMA to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time .PERIOD 
and i realized when i'd come into the meetings with these corrugated metal and chain link stuff ,COMMA and people would just look at me like i'd just landed from mars .PERIOD 
and like the playwright said the other day - i could relate to him :COLON you're not sure .PERIOD 
yeah .PERIOD 
there aren't many people around that are really involved with architecture as clients .PERIOD 
if you think about the world ,COMMA and even just in this audience ,COMMA most of us are involved with buildings .PERIOD 
i knew craig and respected him .PERIOD 
i knew you'd ask that question .PERIOD 
i tried to understand that language as a beginning ,COMMA as a place to jump off ,COMMA and there was so much of it being done by spec builders and it was trivialized so much that it wasn't .PERIOD 
siza ,COMMA on the other hand ,COMMA continued in portugal where the real stuff was and evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language .PERIOD 
i tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didn't pan out .PERIOD 
where you .PERIOD it's like jazz :COLON you improvise ,COMMA you work together ,COMMA you play off each other ,COMMA you make something ,COMMA they make something .PERIOD 
you can come to the opening .PERIOD i'll invite you .PERIOD 
i'd seen drawings you had presented here at ted .PERIOD 
they came for three days .PERIOD 
you've all heard the frank lloyd wright story ,COMMA when the woman called and said ,COMMA mr. wright ,COMMA i'm sitting on the couch and the water's pouring in on my head .PERIOD 
rsw :COLON didn't get a laugh .PERIOD 
what do you bring to it ?QUESTIONMARK 
that's what reminded me of it .PERIOD 
just before going to lunch with the mayor ,COMMA we went to the harbor commissioner .PERIOD 
we sat down ,COMMA and we had a drink of water and everybody was quiet .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i got up .PERIOD 
they just brought us there to hustle this group ,COMMA you know ,COMMA to create a project .PERIOD 
because i want to get a standing ovation like everybody ,COMMA so .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA reliable dutchman - - fantastic !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
so ,COMMA it was going nowhere .PERIOD 
that's what happens .PERIOD 
silas usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations .PERIOD 
don't be trendy if you want to be serious .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA we don't have time .PERIOD 
there were <NUM> artists invited to participate in it ,COMMA and it was one of those things where it was extremely competitive and i didn't want to be embarrassed ,COMMA so i worked very hard on this .PERIOD 
but i was absolutely stuck on the idea of art is and trying to determine what art was .PERIOD 
we've watched the financial markets that we uniquely create - these markets that were supposed to be foolproof - we've watched them kind of collapse before our eyes .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA if we are put in environments where we can't deal with it ,COMMA in some sense makes sense that we actually might mess certain things up .PERIOD 
it feels like we might almost just be built to make errors in certain ways .PERIOD 
so this is the question my students and i wanted to get at .PERIOD 
what if we put holly into the same context as humans ?QUESTIONMARK 
because ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's great for us ,COMMA but bad for humans .PERIOD 
they were these kind of weird things .PERIOD 
so the monkeys get really good at this .PERIOD 
the monkeys would rip-off the tokens at every available opportunity - from each other ,COMMA often from us - you know ,COMMA things we didn't necessarily think we were introducing ,COMMA but things we spontaneously saw .PERIOD 
we were a little impatient so we wanted to sort of speed things up a bit .PERIOD 
sounds great ,COMMA but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money .PERIOD 
your other option is a bit safe .PERIOD your just going to get some money for sure .PERIOD 
so see what your intuition is here .PERIOD 
most people say ,COMMA why should i be risky when i can get <NUM> dollars for sure ?QUESTIONMARK 
and now imagine that i have you make another choice but this time ,COMMA it's a little bit worse .PERIOD 
they actually tend to go a little risky .PERIOD 
and this means that sometimes we'll actually switch our preferences to avoid this .PERIOD 
what you saw in that last scenario is that subjects get risky because they want the small shot that there won't be any loss .PERIOD 
they're why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer - because they're evaluating them in relative terms .PERIOD 
the question we were interested in is whether the monkeys show the same biases .PERIOD 
sometimes the monkeys get no bonus - so this is a bonus of zero .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the monkeys meet two guys who aren't giving them bonuses ;SEMICOLON they're actually giving them less than they expect .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a little bad - sorry ,COMMA sorry ,COMMA sorry .PERIOD 
when you're watching your stocks plummet into the red ,COMMA when you're watching your house price go down ,COMMA you're not going to be able to see that in anything but old evolutionary terms .PERIOD 
but we have to recognize that we have those limitations .PERIOD 
we have this great north .PERIOD and there was a pretty small population ,COMMA and my father was an avid outdoorsman .PERIOD 
but what i think it was telling me is that we are this transient thing that's happening ,COMMA and that the nature that you see out there - the untouched shorelines ,COMMA the untouched forest that i was able to see - really bring in a sense of that geological time ,COMMA that this has gone on for a long time ,COMMA and we're experiencing it in a different way .PERIOD 
this rebirth of grass .PERIOD and then i went out for years trying to photograph the pristine landscape .PERIOD 
so there's this thing that is pulling me in both directions .PERIOD 
but we've become totally disconnected from them .PERIOD 
that if we keep putting things ,COMMA through industrial and urban existence ,COMMA back into the system - if we keep doing that - we can continue on .PERIOD 
because i think everything that we're involved in - our clothing ,COMMA our cars ,COMMA our roads ,COMMA and everything - are directly a result .PERIOD 
i'm going to move to some pictures of china .PERIOD 
so this created a reservoir <NUM> kilometers long ,COMMA one of the largest reservoirs ever created .PERIOD 
and again ,COMMA the rebuilding of the city - to me ,COMMA it was sad to see that they didn't really grab a lot of ,COMMA i guess ,COMMA what we know here ,COMMA in terms of urban planning .PERIOD 
this is a shot in one of the biggest squares in guangdong - and this is where a lot of migrant workers are coming in from the country .PERIOD 
so this is a pink uniform at this factory .PERIOD it's a shoe factory .PERIOD 
and they have dorms for the workers .PERIOD 
this is one with <NUM> ,COMMA so every lunch ,COMMA there's about <NUM> coming through for lunch .PERIOD 
they sit down ;SEMICOLON they have about <NUM> minutes .PERIOD 
they're not getting enough ,COMMA so they're not going to move .PERIOD 
shanghai was a very intriguing city - it's exploding on a level that i don't think any city has experienced .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA even shenzhen ,COMMA the economic zone - one of the first ones - <NUM> years ago was about <NUM> people ,COMMA and today it boasts about <NUM> to <NUM> million .PERIOD 
so this is three of the visible blast furnaces within that shot .PERIOD 
i think one of the issues that we here are facing with china ,COMMA is that they're using a lot of the latest production technology .PERIOD 
but that is the trick that they've got right now ,COMMA that they're winning with ,COMMA is that they're using all the latest technologies and extrusion machines ,COMMA and bringing all the components into play ,COMMA but the assembly is where they're actually bringing in - the country workers are very willing to work .PERIOD they want to work .PERIOD 
i had to have them freeze for <NUM> seconds to get this shot .PERIOD 
there are <NUM> of these machines ;SEMICOLON they're worth about <NUM> dollars each .PERIOD 
so you have about <NUM> people running this ,COMMA and they're just inspecting it - and they're just walking the lines .PERIOD 
this was one of the biggest factories i've ever seen .PERIOD 
but this is what happens to most of the computers .PERIOD 
and as much as there are great things around the corner - and it's palpable in this room - of all of the things that are just about to break that can solve so many problems ,COMMA i'm really hoping that those things will spread around the world and will start to have a positive effect .PERIOD 
some of you might know ,COMMA he's a tedster - stephen sagmeister and i are working on some layouts .PERIOD and this is still in preliminary stages ;SEMICOLON these aren't the finals .PERIOD but these images ,COMMA with worldchanging.com ,COMMA can be placed into any kind of media .PERIOD 
so we're looking at this as trying to build out .PERIOD 
and anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic .PERIOD 
that would be fantastic .PERIOD so those are my three wishes .PERIOD 
and i'd like to start at the very beginning .PERIOD 
the more stuff that's mine ,COMMA the better .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA it's your stuff if it's broken .PERIOD 
and they extract the metals by hand .PERIOD 
so about <NUM> years ago ,COMMA i literally started in my garage tinkering around ,COMMA trying to figure out how to separate these very similar materials from each other ,COMMA and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends ,COMMA in the mining world actually ,COMMA and in the plastics world ,COMMA and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world .PERIOD 
and instead of plopping down several hundred million dollars to build a chemical plant that will only make one type of plastic for its entire life ,COMMA our plants can make any type of plastic we feed them .PERIOD 
we use a very highly automated process to sort those plastics ,COMMA not only by type ,COMMA but by grade .PERIOD 
so i hope i've changed the way you look at at least some of the stuff in your life .PERIOD 
mother nature wastes very little ,COMMA reuses practically everything .PERIOD 
and i hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer - that's a label i've always hated my entire life - and think of yourself as just using resources in one form ,COMMA until they can be transformed to another form for another use later in time .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA it was not always wonderful at that table .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA you could come down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing ,COMMA and then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed ,COMMA except that daddy messed it up .PERIOD 
now that's compassion .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA let me tell you ,COMMA i kind of look at the world this way .PERIOD 
i see - always ,COMMA it stirs my heart - a picture of dr. martin luther king ,COMMA jr .PERIOD 
this is the picture .PERIOD they said ,COMMA it's going to be too volatile for you to go .PERIOD 
we are so connected that we must treat each other as if an action toward you is an action toward myself .PERIOD 
and whatever else is needed ,COMMA i will provide it and pay for it when i return .PERIOD 
this always seemed to me to be a deepening of the sense of what it means to be a good samaritan .PERIOD 
but now ,COMMA to be a good samaritan - and i always say ,COMMA and to be a good american - for me ,COMMA is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care .PERIOD 
and if mama eternal has taught us correctly ,COMMA this song will make sense ,COMMA not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering ,COMMA but to all who sign the charter for compassion .PERIOD 
i just want to say my name is emmanuel jal .PERIOD 
and also telling it like now .PERIOD 
and also ,COMMA the easiest one was when i was doing it in form of a music .PERIOD 
i wanted to revenge for my village .PERIOD 
my every moment .PERIOD 
run ,COMMA duck ,COMMA play dead and hide .PERIOD 
but still as i wonder ,COMMA i won't go under .PERIOD 
i was ready to eat .PERIOD 
give us tools .PERIOD give the farmers tools .PERIOD 
and now we have a couple in university .PERIOD 
♫ what would i be ?QUESTIONMARK ♫ ♫ if emma never rescued me ?QUESTIONMARK ♫ ♫ what would i be ?QUESTIONMARK ♫ ♫ another starving refugee ♫ ♫ what would i be ?QUESTIONMARK ♫ ♫ if emma never rescued me ?QUESTIONMARK ♫ ♫ yeah ,COMMA yeah ♫ ♫ yeah ,COMMA i would have probably died from starvation ♫ ♫ or some other wretched disease ♫ ♫ i would have grown up with no education ♫ ♫ just another refugee ♫ thank you .PERIOD 
we've used fear ,COMMA if you like ,COMMA to grab people's attention .PERIOD 
a deer freezes very ,COMMA very still ,COMMA poised to run away .PERIOD 
and i think that's what we're doing when we're asking people to engage with our agenda around environmental degradation and climate change .PERIOD 
and unsurprisingly ,COMMA people all around the world say that what they want is happiness ,COMMA for themselves ,COMMA for their families ,COMMA their children ,COMMA their communities .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA they think money is slightly important .PERIOD 
it thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck .PERIOD 
what's happening in costa rica ?QUESTIONMARK 
<NUM> percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources .PERIOD 
and so in strict happy-planet methodology ,COMMA we've become less efficient at turning our ultimate scarce resource into the outcome we want to .PERIOD 
a child entering school today will be my age in <NUM> .PERIOD 
and i put it to you ,COMMA that is not business as usual .PERIOD 
i think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing .PERIOD 
and the point of these is they are ,COMMA not quite ,COMMA the secrets of happiness ,COMMA but they are things that i think happiness will flow out the side from .PERIOD 
keep building them .PERIOD 
the second one is be active .PERIOD 
they don't need a lot of material goods to be satisfied .PERIOD 
all that being good and no real credit for it .PERIOD 
so i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA mom and dad ,COMMA what about santa claus ?QUESTIONMARK 
santa would come to our house while we were at nine o'clock high mass on christmas morning ,COMMA but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss .PERIOD 
there's only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence :COLON our family was too strange and weird for even santa claus to come visit ,COMMA and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment ,COMMA this humiliation of rejection by santa ,COMMA who was jolly - but ,COMMA let's face it ,COMMA he was also very judgmental .PERIOD 
they had to fit two criteria :COLON they had to be old enough to be able to understand the whole concept of the age of reason ,COMMA and not yet seven .PERIOD 
i just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven ,COMMA and then you're capable of committing any and all sins against god and man .PERIOD and bill said ,COMMA so ?QUESTIONMARK and then i said ,COMMA so ,COMMA you're six .PERIOD you have a whole year to do anything you want to and god won't notice it .PERIOD and he said ,COMMA so ?QUESTIONMARK and i said ,COMMA so ?QUESTIONMARK so everything !EXCLAMATIONMARK and i turned to run .PERIOD i was so angry with him .PERIOD 
and she said ,COMMA listen .PERIOD the cut-off date to start kindergarten was september <NUM> .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i took the bus downtown to get the new libra poster .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i was raised in the pacific northwest ,COMMA around a lot of church of latter-day saints people and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i've worked with them and even dated them ,COMMA but i never really knew the doctrine or what they said to people when they were out on a mission ,COMMA and i guess i was ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA curious ,COMMA so i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA please ,COMMA come in .PERIOD and they looked really happy ,COMMA because i don't think this happens to them all that often .PERIOD 
and i sat them down ,COMMA and i got them glasses of water - ok ,COMMA i got it .PERIOD i got them glasses of water .PERIOD 
and they told me this story all about this guy named lehi ,COMMA who lived in jerusalem in <NUM> bc .PERIOD 
i wanted to say ,COMMA ok ,COMMA don't start with this story .PERIOD 
i said ,COMMA oh ,COMMA come on .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA even if women tried to have a baby every single year from the time they were <NUM> to the time they were <NUM> ,COMMA assuming they didn't die from exhaustion ,COMMA it still seems like some women would have some time left over to hear the word of god .PERIOD and they said ,COMMA no .PERIOD 
and they said ,COMMA oh - hey ,COMMA well ,COMMA we also believe that when you go to heaven you get your body restored to you in its best original state .PERIOD 
or ,COMMA if you'd gone blind ,COMMA you could see .PERIOD 
if someone came to my door and i was hearing catholic theology and dogma for the very first time ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA we believe that god impregnated a very young girl without the use of intercourse ,COMMA and the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us - - and she had a baby ,COMMA and that's the son of god ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA i would think that's equally ridiculous .PERIOD 
yes ,COMMA breast cancer .PERIOD 
overcome with the enormity of it all and the complete feeling of loss of control ,COMMA i shed copious tears and asked my dear husband ,COMMA jayant .PERIOD 
i danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule .PERIOD 
it's the power of bringing ourselves to the attention of something that so animates you ,COMMA so moves you ,COMMA that something even like cancer becomes insignificant .PERIOD 
it's the power of an image .PERIOD 
nobody really did anything with it ,COMMA pretty much .PERIOD 
they brought all sorts of different computers with them .PERIOD 
so that ,COMMA in all that diversity ,COMMA if i wanted to figure out how to build something out of a bit of this and a bit of this ,COMMA everything i looked into ,COMMA i had to connect to some new machine ,COMMA i had to learn to run some new program ,COMMA i would find the information i wanted in some new data format .PERIOD 
and that is what has made it most fun .PERIOD 
they're much more than we'd originally imagined when we put together the little ,COMMA initial website that we started off with .PERIOD 
one of the great - yes a lot of people have seen it - one of the great ted talks .PERIOD 
hans put up this presentation in which he showed ,COMMA for various different countries ,COMMA in various different colors - he showed income levels on one axis and he showed infant mortality ,COMMA and he shot this thing animated through time .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA he'd taken this data and made a presentation which just shattered a lot of myths that people had about the economics in the developing world .PERIOD 
it had underground all the data ok ,COMMA data is brown and boxy and boring ,COMMA and that's how we think of it ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK 
in this case ,COMMA hans had put the data together he had found from all kinds of united nations websites and things .PERIOD 
we're using them for people ,COMMA we're using them for places ,COMMA we're using them for your products ,COMMA we're using them for events .PERIOD 
i wrote an article entitled linked data a couple of years ago and soon after that ,COMMA things started to happen .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA we have to ask for raw data now .PERIOD 
practice that .PERIOD it's important because you have no idea the number of excuses people come up with to hang onto their data and not give it to you ,COMMA even though you've paid for it as a taxpayer .PERIOD 
the people who are going to solve those - the scientists - they have half-formed ideas in their head ,COMMA they try to communicate those over the web .PERIOD 
and that is what linked data is all about .PERIOD 
you get this really huge power out of it .PERIOD 
then i realized that what i was getting from giving was a narcissistic hit - that i felt good about myself .PERIOD 
right now ,COMMA as bill mcdonough has pointed out ,COMMA the objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences .PERIOD 
and i spent a couple of weeks going around with a social work agency that ministered to the homeless .PERIOD and i realized seeing the homeless through their eyes that almost all of them were psychiatric patients that had nowhere to go .PERIOD they had a diagnosis .PERIOD it made me - what it did was to shake me out of the urban trance where ,COMMA when we see ,COMMA when we're passing someone who's homeless in the periphery of our vision ,COMMA it stays on the periphery .PERIOD 
one day soon after that - it was a friday - at the end of the day ,COMMA i went down - i was going down to the subway .PERIOD it was rush hour and thousands of people were streaming down the stairs .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA anyway ,COMMA the next morning we had to go along to the jeweler and get it cut off .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA yes ,COMMA all these other ones as well .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA how do you do this ?QUESTIONMARK 
so i suppose you're not going to be able to kick me off the stage ,COMMA since you asked the question .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA just help us with some of the numbers .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA how big is the group overall ?QUESTIONMARK 
no ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA i think - ca :COLON but is that your hair ?QUESTIONMARK 
ok .PERIOD 
of course .PERIOD 
yeah ,COMMA well ,COMMA <NUM> years earlier ,COMMA we'd launched the sex pistols' god save the queen ,COMMA and i'd certainly never expected that <NUM> years later - that she'd actually knight us .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA i got pulled out of the sea i think six times by helicopters ,COMMA so - and each time ,COMMA i didn't expect to come home to tell the tale .PERIOD 
but the ends of all those balloon trips were ,COMMA you know - something seemed to go wrong every time ,COMMA and on that particular occasion ,COMMA the more experienced balloonist who was with me jumped ,COMMA and left me holding on for dear life .PERIOD 
yeah .PERIOD no ,COMMA i put on my oxygen mask and stood on top of the balloon ,COMMA with my parachute ,COMMA looking at the swirling clouds below ,COMMA trying to pluck up my courage to jump into the north sea ,COMMA which - and it was a very ,COMMA very ,COMMA very lonely few moments .PERIOD 
the years - and until i stopped looking at the polls ,COMMA you were sort of regarded as this great hero in the u.k. and elsewhere .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA this isn't exactly hardball .PERIOD ok .PERIOD 
didn't - weren't you just terrible at school ?QUESTIONMARK 
and generally ,COMMA the people would say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA well that's bad news .PERIOD 
did this really happen ?QUESTIONMARK 
and making us go on wonderful ,COMMA long bike rides .PERIOD 
but is there a risk here ?QUESTIONMARK 
i was actually prosecuted under two quite ancient acts in the u.k .PERIOD 
we changed it to social diseases and people came along with acne and spots ,COMMA but nobody came with vd any more .PERIOD 
and john mortimer ,COMMA the playwright ,COMMA defended us .PERIOD 
so seriously ,COMMA is there a dark side ?QUESTIONMARK 
there was a nasty biography written about you by someone .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA do you think about life balance ?QUESTIONMARK 
but the problem with capitalism is extreme wealth ends up in the hands of a few people ,COMMA and therefore extreme responsibility ,COMMA i think ,COMMA goes with that wealth .PERIOD 
and is there a risk that the kind of the business heroes of the west get so excited about - i mean ,COMMA they're used to having an idea ,COMMA getting stuff done ,COMMA and they believe profoundly in their ability to make a difference in the world .PERIOD 
but i think business leaders can bring their entrepreneurial know-how and help governments approach things slightly differently .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA richard ,COMMA when i was starting off in business ,COMMA i knew nothing about it and i also was sort of - i thought that business people were supposed to just be ruthless and that that was the only way you could have a chance of succeeding .PERIOD 
so i would like to thank you for that inspiration ,COMMA and for coming to ted today .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD 
i would say with a great smile ,COMMA i will definitely pass .PERIOD 
he just started asking ,COMMA where did you buy the radio ?QUESTIONMARK how much is it ?QUESTIONMARK 
and he said ,COMMA oh ,COMMA i teach at a college of arts .PERIOD 
it can be ruins ,COMMA or it can be music ,COMMA or it can be painting or drawing or writing ,COMMA whatever it is .PERIOD 
but it is just a kind of trace of that time .PERIOD 
so it took about <NUM> hours to get this line .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what we see is just what we think often ,COMMA and most of the time ,COMMA we don't see what it is .PERIOD 
so this work from this period is mostly like - you know ,COMMA this is a work called light makes dark .PERIOD 
this is an exact negative .PERIOD 
but a solution arrived after being quiet and not working for about six ,COMMA seven months ,COMMA in the restroom ,COMMA when i was changing the air freshener that goes from solid substance to vapor .PERIOD 
this is the work i made out of that material .PERIOD 
so i told them ,COMMA i'd like to start an air freshener company .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i just started doing this work to inquire further about how to sculpt the space between this object and there .PERIOD 
because ,COMMA as a visual artist ,COMMA if i'm seeing this and i'm seeing that - but how to sculpt this ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's the same in marketing .PERIOD 
it only took one robust observation from copernicus to blow that idea out of the water .PERIOD 
take bp - they spent millions of pounds over many years building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand ,COMMA but then one little accident .PERIOD 
the same is true of marketing .PERIOD 
it makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force ,COMMA which is ultimately good for your brand .PERIOD 
i see you're all up on the history of hurdy-gurdy - vielle à roue .PERIOD 
it's also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique .PERIOD 
and today ,COMMA the hurdy-gurdy is used in all sorts of music - traditional folk music ,COMMA dance ,COMMA contemporary and world music - in the u.k. in france ,COMMA in spain and in italy .PERIOD 
but the moment you fall in love ,COMMA you become extremely sexually possessive of them .PERIOD 
but the main characteristics of romantic love are craving :COLON an intense craving to be with a particular person ,COMMA not just sexually ,COMMA but emotionally .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA the very last question i would ask them - i would always have to work myself up to this question ,COMMA because i am not a psychologist .PERIOD 
the motor of the brain .PERIOD it's a drive .PERIOD 
and in fact ,COMMA i think it's more powerful than the sex drive .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA you can feel it when you're just driving along in your car .PERIOD 
i think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time ,COMMA thereby conserving mating time and energy .PERIOD 
they've got incredible people skills ,COMMA negotiating skills .PERIOD 
they're highly imaginative .PERIOD 
and - basic math !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
we are seeing the rise of female sexual expression .PERIOD 
indeed ,COMMA arranged marriages are on their way off this braid of human life .PERIOD 
i even think that marriages might even become more stable because of the second great world trend .PERIOD 
it may decline some more .PERIOD 
not at any time on this planet have women been so educated ,COMMA so interesting ,COMMA so capable .PERIOD 
however ,COMMA there's always kinds of complications in this .PERIOD 
in these three brain systems :COLON lust ,COMMA romantic love and attachment - don't always go together .PERIOD 
but i want to tell you a story about - to illustrate .PERIOD 
i've been carrying on here about the biology of love .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA wasn't that rickshaw driver handsome !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
these circuits are deeply embedded in the human brain .PERIOD 
they're going to survive as long as our species survives on what shakespeare called this mortal coil .PERIOD 
one of the threads that seems to have come through loud and clear in the last couple of days is this need to reconcile what the big wants - the big being the organization ,COMMA the system ,COMMA the country - and what the small wants - the individual ,COMMA the person .PERIOD 
charlie ledbetter ,COMMA yesterday ,COMMA i thought ,COMMA talked very articulately about this need to bring consumers ,COMMA to bring people into the process of creating things .PERIOD 
and that's what i want to talk about today .PERIOD 
<NUM> .PERIOD 
i think something happens .PERIOD i think a head may appear in a second .PERIOD 
we showed them the whole cut ,COMMA and they were all completely ,COMMA what is this ?QUESTIONMARK 
and the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day ,COMMA all you do is look at the roof ,COMMA and it's a really shitty experience .PERIOD 
it's a history of invention based around this .PERIOD 
when we actually went and watched this procedure taking place - and i'll explain this in a second - it became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this that they really weren't recognizing .PERIOD 
why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence ?QUESTIONMARK 
because we kind of have to - we're just compelled to .PERIOD 
we don't know why ,COMMA but we do .PERIOD 
so what is this ?QUESTIONMARK i hear you all ask .PERIOD no ,COMMA i don't .PERIOD 
so what seems like a very clunky product is ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA incredibly useful .PERIOD 
these guys are using this very successfully .PERIOD 
how far you can anticipate ,COMMA what follows from it ,COMMA what are the threats ,COMMA what are the possibilities ,COMMA the challenges ,COMMA the opportunities ?QUESTIONMARK 
and all the components are there which are now in common parlance ,COMMA in our vocabulary ,COMMA you know ,COMMA 30-odd years later :COLON wind energy ,COMMA recycling ,COMMA biomass ,COMMA solar cells .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA if ,COMMA in that bucky-inspired phrase ,COMMA we draw back and we look at planet earth ,COMMA and we take a kind of typical ,COMMA industrialized society ,COMMA then the energy consumed would be split between the buildings ,COMMA <NUM> percent ,COMMA transport ,COMMA <NUM> percent ,COMMA and industry .PERIOD 
if you compared detroit with a city of a northern european example - and munich is not a bad example of that ,COMMA with the greater dependence on walking and cycling - then a city which is really only twice as dense ,COMMA is only using one-tenth of the energy .PERIOD 
in other words ,COMMA you take these comparable examples and the energy leap is enormous .PERIOD 
how does it affect the design of buildings ?QUESTIONMARK 
the one example i take is a corporate headquarters for a company called willis and faber ,COMMA in a small market town in the northeast of england ,COMMA commuting distance with london .PERIOD 
this building was wired for change .PERIOD 
in other words ,COMMA we didn't have the technology to do what would be really interesting on that building .PERIOD 
and if i fast-forward in time ,COMMA what is interesting is that the technology is now available and celebratory .PERIOD 
the library of the free university ,COMMA which opened last year ,COMMA is an example of that .PERIOD 
so it's not a kind of sacrifice ,COMMA quite the reverse .PERIOD 
and just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology ,COMMA the ability to plot points in the sky and to transmit ,COMMA to transfer that information now ,COMMA directly into the factory .PERIOD 
for wind tunnels ,COMMA we would literally put them in a wind tunnel and blast air ,COMMA and the many kilometers of cable and so on .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA major transformation .PERIOD 
it's been well known that the dead sea is dying .PERIOD 
how do you make them more friendly at that scale ?QUESTIONMARK 
hong kong i refer to as a kind of analog experience in a digital age ,COMMA because you always have a point of reference .PERIOD 
<NUM> - excuse me ,COMMA <NUM> people working <NUM> hours ,COMMA seven days .PERIOD 
contagious is a good word .PERIOD 
laughter is contagious .PERIOD passion is contagious .PERIOD 
and that directly increased student wellbeing .PERIOD 
and that can't happen in a classroom .PERIOD 
and ahmedabad got the first child-friendly zebra crossing in the world .PERIOD 
man :COLON this program is wonderful .PERIOD 
we have to start collecting from <NUM> .PERIOD 
kbs :COLON so ,COMMA the charter of compassion starts right here .PERIOD 
it was incredible .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i was paid in dollars as a consultant ,COMMA and i looked at my income tax return and tried to ask myself :COLON is there a line in my return ,COMMA which shows how much of this income has gone to the people whose knowledge has made it possible ?QUESTIONMARK 
i tried to convince myself that ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA i have worked for the policy changes .PERIOD 
and this was a moment of great pain and trauma because i couldn't live with it any longer .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA they invite the honey bees through their colors ,COMMA and the bees don't keep all the honey for themselves .PERIOD 
these are the three guiding principles of the honey bee network :COLON that whenever we learn something from people it must be shared with them in their language .PERIOD 
you cannot discriminate .PERIOD 
i'm so sorry to say that .PERIOD 
the rice that you ate in the lunch ,COMMA and you will eat today ,COMMA is transplanted by women bending in a very awkward posture ,COMMA millions of them ,COMMA every season ,COMMA in the paddy season ,COMMA when they transplant paddy with their feet in the water .PERIOD 
and feet in the water will develop fungus ,COMMA infections ,COMMA and that infection pains because then other insects bite that point .PERIOD 
and this is what he got painted .PERIOD 
there could be nothing more wrong than the maslowian model of hierarchy of needs because the poorest people in this country can get enlightenment .PERIOD 
so here's a model where a two-wheeler washing machine .PERIOD 
so it is better ,COMMA it is safer ;SEMICOLON it is affordable ,COMMA it is energy-efficient .PERIOD 
so why are people willing to adjust with that mismatch ?QUESTIONMARK 
for example ,COMMA cell phones :COLON we have <NUM> million cellphones in this country .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the eminent model ,COMMA the long-tail model tells you that small sales of a large number of books ,COMMA for example ,COMMA having only a few copies sold can still be a viable model .PERIOD 
look at what he is doing .PERIOD 
but he has modified a two-wheeler so that he can get autonomy and freedom and flexibility .PERIOD 
and we have a very vibrant network in china ,COMMA particularly ,COMMA but also emerging in brazil and other parts of the world .PERIOD 
i can't change the condition of the road ,COMMA but i can make the cycle run faster .PERIOD 
and this is a donkey cart which they modified .PERIOD 
this is in china .PERIOD this girl needed a breathing apparatus .PERIOD 
there's a whole range of innovations that we have .PERIOD 
a car ,COMMA which runs on compressed air with six paisa per kilometer .PERIOD 
and he didn't mean the comfort of a five-course dinner as opposed to a one-course meal ,COMMA but he really meant the comfort of the quality of the building for the people .PERIOD 
so in an indirect way ,COMMA you can see the sun .PERIOD 
and what they did is they created an integral building element to improve the quality of the space that surrounds the visitors of the museum .PERIOD 
they created this shade that you can see here ,COMMA which actually covers the sun ,COMMA but opens up to the good light from the sky .PERIOD 
they allowed themselves a few mistakes along the way .PERIOD 
this is richard kelly who was born <NUM> years ago ,COMMA which is the reason i bring him up now ,COMMA because it's kind of an anniversary year .PERIOD 
he meant something like this - where the light gives direction to the space and helps you to get around .PERIOD 
these three distinct elements ,COMMA together ,COMMA make a lighting environment that helps us to feel better .PERIOD 
how do they share their culture ?QUESTIONMARK 
the problem is though that i wanted to explain to you how this really works - but i can have four of these on my finger ,COMMA so you would not to be able to really see them .PERIOD 
so just to explain .PERIOD 
why are all these motorways permanently lit ?QUESTIONMARK 
can we maybe be much more selective and create better environments that also benefit from darkness ?QUESTIONMARK 
can we engage people more in the lighting projects that we create ,COMMA so they really want to connect with it ,COMMA like here ?QUESTIONMARK 
where have they come from ?QUESTIONMARK where are they going ?QUESTIONMARK 
and it only embodies all these stories and all this suspense because of the darkness and the light .PERIOD 
they pointed out that ,COMMA i believe it was between <NUM> and <NUM> years from today ,COMMA they will be steering cars by wire ,COMMA without all that mechanical stuff .PERIOD 
it really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it in the ibot for the disabled community .PERIOD 
the big idea here is ,COMMA i think ,COMMA a new piece of a solution to a fairly big problem in transportation .PERIOD 
for instance ,COMMA in that time ,COMMA <NUM> percent of america lived either on farms or in small towns .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA the car - the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage - was a big deal ;SEMICOLON it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage .PERIOD 
it all made sense ,COMMA with <NUM> percent of the people living there .PERIOD 
three million people die every year in cities due to bad air ,COMMA and almost all particulate pollution on this planet is produced by transportation devices ,COMMA particularly sitting in cities .PERIOD 
i don't look like a motor vehicle .PERIOD 
we're a recreational vehicle that doesn't really matter ,COMMA and i don't spend my time doing that kind of stuff .PERIOD 
then she looks up ,COMMA she's looking up ,COMMA and she says ,COMMA and i'm <NUM> years old ,COMMA and i don't drive a car anymore .PERIOD 
we need water .PERIOD 
we figured out how to put a vapor-compression distiller on this thing ,COMMA with a counter-flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat ,COMMA then using a little bit of the electricity control that process ,COMMA and for <NUM> watts ,COMMA which is a little more than half of its waste heat ,COMMA it will make <NUM> gallons an hour of distilled water from anything that comes into it to cool it .PERIOD 
so if we put this box on here in a few years ,COMMA could we have a solution to transportation ,COMMA electricity ,COMMA and communication ,COMMA and maybe drinkable water in a sustainable package that weighs <NUM> pounds ?QUESTIONMARK 
we tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important ;SEMICOLON we'll typically do it twice .PERIOD once ,COMMA we want to do it first .PERIOD 
and then it's time to do it again .PERIOD last year .PERIOD 
after it falls below a critical price ,COMMA it will tend ,COMMA if it's successful ,COMMA to rise above a critical mass ,COMMA a penetration .PERIOD 
and maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them ,COMMA and bring the rest of your entertainment in .PERIOD 
this is a fascinating research from who that shows the effect of generic drugs on anti-retroviral drug compounds and cocktails .PERIOD 
linux is another good example .PERIOD 
two percent isn't <NUM> percent ,COMMA but in the car business ,COMMA which is slow moving ,COMMA that's huge ;SEMICOLON that's arrival .PERIOD 
free is something that comes with digital ,COMMA because the reproduction costs are essentially free .PERIOD it comes with ip ,COMMA because it's such an efficient protocol .PERIOD it comes with fiber optics ,COMMA because there's so much bandwidth .PERIOD 
it's an economic force ;SEMICOLON it's a technical force .PERIOD 
because of some of technologies we've been talking about .PERIOD 
and by definition ,COMMA every one of you who is in this room must consider yourself a global soul ,COMMA a global citizen .PERIOD 
even more problematic ,COMMA they're not listening to poor people themselves .PERIOD 
in <NUM> i met this incredible entrepreneur named amitabha sadangi from india ,COMMA who'd been working for <NUM> years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet .PERIOD 
and he was expressing his frustration that the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether ,COMMA despite the fact that <NUM> million farmers alone in india make under a dollar a day .PERIOD 
but the market also had bypassed low income farmers ,COMMA because these systems were both too expensive ,COMMA and they were constructed for fields that were too large .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA when you go back to the beginning ,COMMA there were no private investors who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology for a market class that made under a dollar a day ,COMMA that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors ,COMMA agriculture .PERIOD 
secondarily ,COMMA we wanted to see if we could export this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries .PERIOD 
in arusha ,COMMA tanzania ,COMMA a to z textile manufacturing has worked in partnership with us ,COMMA with unicef ,COMMA with the global fund ,COMMA to create a factory that now employs <NUM> people ,COMMA mostly women .PERIOD 
so that in the terrorist attacks of november they were the first responder ,COMMA and are now beginning to scale ,COMMA because of partnership .PERIOD 
president obama understands that .PERIOD 
it's not hyperbole to say that these civil society institutions and these social entrepreneurs are building real alternatives to the taliban .PERIOD 
it was about <NUM> degrees .PERIOD 
and because i wanted to impress you all with slides ,COMMA since i saw the great presentations yesterday with graphs ,COMMA i made a graph that moves ,COMMA and i talk about the makeup of me .PERIOD 
during the hurricane ,COMMA you had msnbc posting about the hurricane on their blog ,COMMA updating it frequently .PERIOD this was possible because of the easy nature of blogging tools .PERIOD 
they sent a search party ,COMMA and i overheard people saying they wish i had killed myself ,COMMA jumped off bible peak .PERIOD 
and i won it .PERIOD i reached all of these people ,COMMA and i had tens of thousands of people reading about my life everyday .PERIOD 
and then i wrote a post about a banjo .PERIOD 
and my husband - this is my husband ,COMMA who is very hot - he won an award for being hot - - he told me ,COMMA you cannot buy a banjo .PERIOD 
and those people who know me understood my joke .PERIOD 
how much money does he spend on beer in a year ?QUESTIONMARK 
and then i got people saying ,COMMA leave him .PERIOD 
and why are they reading this ?QUESTIONMARK 
this is not science ,COMMA but this was enough for me to be really so interested in how we have evolved and how we can trace our line .PERIOD 
this is the only picture i have .PERIOD and to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs ;SEMICOLON to think about the people who are on those $ <NUM> computers talking about who they are ,COMMA sharing these personal stories - this is an amazing thing .PERIOD 
and - and so i printed out her - or i sent a pdf of her blog to her family ,COMMA and they passed it out at her memorial service ,COMMA and even in her obituary ,COMMA they mentioned her blog because it was such a big part of her life .PERIOD 
you can see in its shape and its streamlined design it's powered for ocean swimming .PERIOD 
it flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins ,COMMA gets lift ,COMMA powers its movements with a lunate tail .PERIOD 
this tuna symbolizes what's the problem for all of us in the room .PERIOD 
so take a look at that animal .PERIOD 
so in a program called tag-a-giant we've actually gone from ireland to canada ,COMMA from corsica to spain .PERIOD 
and that's the fisheries off the state of north carolina .PERIOD 
they're coming together .PERIOD that could be tuna sex - and there it is .PERIOD 
so from data like this ,COMMA we're able now to put the map up ,COMMA and in this map you see thousands of positions generated by this decade and a half of tagging .PERIOD 
salmon sharks go down to the tropics to pup and come into monterey .PERIOD 
we just need to put it together .PERIOD 
we have the technology that's shown us where it is .PERIOD 
hi there .PERIOD i'm hasan .PERIOD i'm an artist .PERIOD 
basically this is the fbi offices in tampa where i spent six months of my life - back and forth ,COMMA not six months continuously .PERIOD 
or questions such as - actually ,COMMA during the polygraph ,COMMA which was how it finally ended after nine consecutive of them - one of the polygraph questions was .PERIOD 
and it's like ,COMMA guys ,COMMA i travel a lot .PERIOD 
don't want to make it look like i'm making any sudden moves .PERIOD 
and so i just kept doing this over and over and over .PERIOD 
then i'd make websites .PERIOD 
so you can see ,COMMA delta <NUM> going from kansas city to atlanta .PERIOD 
this was on delta <NUM> going from jfk to san francisco .PERIOD 
these are the airports that i hang out in ,COMMA because i like airports .PERIOD 
but if you can cross-reference this with the other data ,COMMA then you're basically replaying the roll of the fbi agent and putting it all together .PERIOD 
this is exactly where my old apartment in san francisco was .PERIOD 
and then sometimes you get this .PERIOD 
so there's multiple databases .PERIOD 
so there's different categorizations of meals eaten outside empty train stations ,COMMA empty gas stations .PERIOD 
at <NUM> p.m. was this one .PERIOD at <NUM> p.m. was this one .PERIOD 
every few moments i shoot the image .PERIOD 
so by me putting all this information out there ,COMMA what i'm basically telling you is i'm telling you everything .PERIOD 
and the reason their information has any value is ,COMMA well ,COMMA because no one else has access to it .PERIOD 
and by me cutting out the middle man and giving it straight to you ,COMMA the information that the fbi has has no value ,COMMA so thus devaluing their currency .PERIOD 
so in a way ,COMMA i'm glad that i'm completely obsolete .PERIOD 
and you know ,COMMA some of my friends have always said ,COMMA hey ,COMMA you're just paranoid .PERIOD why are you doing this ?QUESTIONMARK 
so you can see that the homeland security likes to come by - department of homeland security .PERIOD 
bruno giussani :COLON hasan ,COMMA just curious .PERIOD 
so it's just become another day .PERIOD 
and everything's automated at the other end .PERIOD 
on the day you are in a place where there is no coverage ,COMMA the fbi gets crazy ?QUESTIONMARK 
well it goes to the last point that i was at .PERIOD 
hasan ,COMMA thank you very much .PERIOD 
you all know the truth of what i'm going to say .PERIOD 
but first ,COMMA see what a miserable lot we are .PERIOD 
even the people just below the top have less good health than the people at the top .PERIOD 
and there ,COMMA you see it in relation to the measure of inequality i've just shown you ,COMMA which i shall use over and over again in the data .PERIOD 
that's very important in poorer countries ,COMMA but not in the rich developed world .PERIOD 
but in the more equal societies ,COMMA it rises to <NUM> or <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
this is violence .PERIOD 
there's a about a tenfold difference there ,COMMA log scale up the side .PERIOD 
but it goes from about <NUM> to <NUM> people in prison .PERIOD 
basically ,COMMA it's asking :COLON do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons ,COMMA or is there no relationship between the two ?QUESTIONMARK 
one is that ,COMMA in graph after graph ,COMMA we find the countries that do worse ,COMMA whatever the outcome ,COMMA seem to be the more unequal ones ,COMMA and the ones that do well seem to be the nordic countries and japan .PERIOD 
it's not just one or two things that go wrong ,COMMA it's most things .PERIOD 
i am not talking about perfect equality ,COMMA i'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies .PERIOD 
it also leads to status insecurity .PERIOD 
the big change in our understanding of drivers of chronic health in the rich developed world is how important chronic stress from social sources is affecting the immune system ,COMMA the cardiovascular system .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA i didn't have that in mind ,COMMA so .PERIOD 
the acid will ruin the gold plating .PERIOD 
beneath it is a wonderful knife .PERIOD 
no .PERIOD but is it fun ?QUESTIONMARK 
so i type design emotion and my website wasn't first again .PERIOD 
it's so much fun to drive .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA a psychologist ,COMMA alice isen ,COMMA did this wonderful experiment .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA she'd bring people into the room ,COMMA and there'd be a string hanging down here and a string hanging down here .PERIOD 
you get a little problem ,COMMA you say ,COMMA ah ,COMMA i'll figure it out .PERIOD 
there's an amazing amount of stuff that's built into the brain .PERIOD 
behavioral is subconscious ,COMMA you're unaware of it .PERIOD 
almost everything we do is subconscious .PERIOD 
and the tea is sitting in this stuff to the right - the tea is to the right of this line .PERIOD 
and the reason you might buy it now is because you care about the environment .PERIOD 
the other neat thing .PERIOD 
so that's the new me .PERIOD 
the graph was interesting ,COMMA although you need to consider it carefully .PERIOD 
it did not correlate with the size of classrooms .PERIOD 
if you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools ,COMMA where the score was <NUM> percent ,COMMA and ,COMMA let's say ,COMMA took that up to <NUM> percent - that will be a completely different thing .PERIOD 
the last question is what everybody said ,COMMA but you know ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA they must have poked their head over the wall and asked the people in your office ,COMMA can you show me how to do it ,COMMA and then somebody taught him .PERIOD 
he came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad .PERIOD 
i left the computer there with lots of cds - i didn't have any internet - and came back three months later .PERIOD 
and as soon as they saw me they said ,COMMA we need a faster processor and a better mouse .PERIOD 
so i said ,COMMA but how did you understand what's going on over there ?QUESTIONMARK 
so then i measured ,COMMA and they were using <NUM> english words with each other - mispronounced ,COMMA but correct usage - words like exit ,COMMA stop ,COMMA find ,COMMA save ,COMMA that kind of thing ,COMMA not only to do with the computer but in their day-to-day conversations .PERIOD 
this is the himalayas .PERIOD up in the north ,COMMA very cold .PERIOD 
i want to just cut this short .PERIOD we did this over and over again .PERIOD 
so if they have access to the computer ,COMMA they will teach themselves ,COMMA including intelligence .PERIOD 
but we got a clean learning curve ,COMMA almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school .PERIOD 
i'll leave it at that ,COMMA because ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA it sort of says it all ,COMMA doesn't it ?QUESTIONMARK 
an educational technology and pedagogy that is digital ,COMMA automatic ,COMMA fault-tolerant ,COMMA minimally invasive ,COMMA connected and self-organized .PERIOD 
and it's about rediscovering idealism in all of that wreckage .PERIOD 
i negotiated with saddam's diplomats at the u.n .PERIOD 
i'd already served in germany ,COMMA norway ,COMMA various other places ,COMMA but i was posted to new york to serve on the u.n. security council for the british delegation .PERIOD 
and there ,COMMA i dealt with things like the middle east peace process ,COMMA the lockerbie issue - we can talk about that later ,COMMA if you wish - but above all ,COMMA my responsibility was iraq and its weapons of mass destruction and the sanctions we placed on iraq to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons .PERIOD 
i decided to take a sabbatical ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA at the new school ,COMMA bruce .PERIOD 
so took a running leap and jumped over the edge of a cliff .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA in a way ,COMMA i've got used to the sensation of it .PERIOD 
a lot of my friends were still in it .PERIOD 
it was anarchy .PERIOD 
and it's a very horrible thing to see anarchy ,COMMA to know that the police and the military - there were lots of military troops there - actually can't stop that rampaging mob who's coming down the street .PERIOD 
they were not allowed a foreign office to help them deal with this immensely complicated process ,COMMA which became known as the final status process of kosovo .PERIOD 
and i came to kosovo and advised the kosovo government .PERIOD 
if they can't do it ,COMMA who's left to deal with it ?QUESTIONMARK 
so we will be bringing darfuri rebel groups ,COMMA the northern cypriots and the southern cypriots ,COMMA rebels from aceh ,COMMA and awful long laundry list of chaotic conflicts around the world .PERIOD 
that is the politics of the <NUM> century ,COMMA and in a way ,COMMA independent diplomat embodies that fragmentation ,COMMA that change ,COMMA that is happening to all of us .PERIOD 
now today ,COMMA we're not talking about good and bad tv .PERIOD 
this is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom .PERIOD 
is television literally functioning as our conscience ,COMMA tempting us and rewarding us at the same time ?QUESTIONMARK 
we surveyed the top-20 nielsen shows every year for <NUM> years - a thousand shows .PERIOD 
viewers had responded dramatically .PERIOD 
this was the first show that allowed viewers to say ,COMMA my god ,COMMA i can comment on how i feel about the vietnam war ,COMMA about the presidency ,COMMA through television ?QUESTIONMARK 
it can change us ?QUESTIONMARK 
that's mapped against the red dot ,COMMA unemployment ,COMMA which is a simple bureau of labor department statistic .PERIOD 
we had the bursting of the tech bubble .PERIOD 
i can vote you off the island .PERIOD 
there has not been a decade of television without a definitive ,COMMA dominant tv mom .PERIOD 
maude findlay ,COMMA the epitome of the irreverent <NUM> ,COMMA who tackled abortion ,COMMA divorce ,COMMA even menopause on tv .PERIOD 
murphy brown took on a vice president when she took on the idea of single parenthood .PERIOD 
this era's mom ,COMMA bree van de kamp .PERIOD 
so here's the metaphor i'm offering today .PERIOD 
previous to this time ,COMMA i was very selfish and self-righteous .PERIOD 
and on this higher level he becomes loving and forgiving .PERIOD 
but here's the weirdest place of all :COLON war .PERIOD 
i passes insensibly into a we ,COMMA my becomes our and individual faith loses its central importance .PERIOD 
now profane is the opposite of sacred .PERIOD 
it just means ordinary or common .PERIOD 
durkheim believed that anything that unites us takes on an air of sacredness .PERIOD 
i'm offering the metaphor of a staircase in the mind .PERIOD 
so here's the million-dollar question for social scientists like me :COLON is the staircase a feature of our evolutionary design ?QUESTIONMARK 
or is it a bug ,COMMA a mistake in the system - this religious stuff is just something that happens when the wires cross in the brain - jill has a stroke and she has this religious experience ,COMMA it's just a mistake ?QUESTIONMARK 
there's a mutation in the gene and one of them mutates to follow a selfish strategy .PERIOD 
it's so big and powerful and efficient that it can take resources from the greens ,COMMA from the defectors ,COMMA the cheaters .PERIOD 
and pretty soon the whole population is actually composed of these new superorganisms .PERIOD 
we're not locked into cooperation the way bees and ants are .PERIOD 
we're bees .PERIOD we busted out of the hive during the enlightenment .PERIOD 
we unleashed earth-changing creativity and generated vast wealth and comfort .PERIOD 
what's missing ?QUESTIONMARK 
and that gives me hope because people are not purely selfish .PERIOD 
every man is a piece of the continent ,COMMA a part of the main .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
there was no more space in the house .PERIOD so i went out to the backyard ,COMMA and without any previous building experience ,COMMA and about <NUM> dollars and some recycled materials ,COMMA i built this space .PERIOD 
there was enough space .PERIOD and i had control ,COMMA which was very important .PERIOD 
he won the silver medal for ireland in the <NUM> olympics ,COMMA and he trains in this space .PERIOD he trains other people .PERIOD 
museum quality .PERIOD 
i had requested slides ,COMMA kind of adamantly ,COMMA up till the - pretty much ,COMMA last few days ,COMMA but was denied access to a slide projector .PERIOD 
these are a couple of garage doors painted identical ,COMMA situated next to each other .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA here's the first door .PERIOD you know ,COMMA you get the message .PERIOD 
this is for a book by metropolis .PERIOD 
when i first contacted william burroughs about being part of it ,COMMA he said no ;SEMICOLON he said he didn't believe it was the end of print .PERIOD 
and also ,COMMA surprisingly ,COMMA it was done in kind of a cheap metal ,COMMA and it had completely rusted through ,COMMA and water everywhere ,COMMA and spiders .PERIOD 
and i thought ,COMMA you know ,COMMA what were they thinking ?QUESTIONMARK 
got no way of tracking it ,COMMA so i could be totally wrong .PERIOD 
i don't have the site .PERIOD it's just the piece itself .PERIOD 
i found out that's very true ,COMMA working on this campaign worldwide .PERIOD 
but anyway ,COMMA this is one of the ads i was most pleased with ,COMMA because they were all elaborately art-directed ,COMMA and this one i thought actually felt like the girl was looking at the computer .PERIOD 
in germany ,COMMA they made one small change without checking with me - nor did they have to ,COMMA because it was done through agencies - but see if you can tell the difference .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i understand their logic .PERIOD i totally disagree with it ;SEMICOLON i think it's a very small-minded approach ,COMMA the world is certainly much more global ,COMMA and i certainly think the people of germany could have handled a little black girl sitting in front of a computer ,COMMA though we'll never know .PERIOD 
article on bryan ferry - just really boring article - so i set the whole article in dingbat .PERIOD 
it's kind of horsey type ,COMMA but the texture - the second plane not quite hitting :COLON there was something more enticing ,COMMA if that's the right - it's not the right word - but in this cover than time or newsweek .PERIOD 
it did not let up .PERIOD 
there were a lot of orphans made this day ,COMMA and here's a dead body being brought out .PERIOD 
this is my desktop .PERIOD 
this is - i like found art ;SEMICOLON hand lettering's coming back in a big way ,COMMA and i thought this was a great example of both .PERIOD 
but i was asked to give a talk at a conference in sacramento a few years back .PERIOD 
and i remembered seeing this photograph of my father ,COMMA who was a test pilot ,COMMA and he told me that when you signed up to become a test pilot ,COMMA they told you that there was a <NUM> to <NUM> percent chance of death on the job .PERIOD 
i've spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about .PERIOD 
before that ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA technology didn't exist .PERIOD but obviously it did .PERIOD 
but it's still very ,COMMA very productive .PERIOD so i'm attempting to say ,COMMA if we take technology's view of the world ,COMMA what does it want ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i think once we ask that question we have to go back ,COMMA actually ,COMMA to life .PERIOD because obviously ,COMMA if we keep extending the origins of technology far back ,COMMA i think we come back to life at some point .PERIOD 
brian farrell's work is all part of this agenda to try and actually discover all the species on earth .PERIOD 
more and more of the inert matter of the globe is being touched and animated by life .PERIOD 
and the last thing ,COMMA i bring back this nudibranch .PERIOD 
and so the general ,COMMA long-term trends of evolution are roughly these five :COLON ubiquity ,COMMA diversity ,COMMA specialization ,COMMA complexity and socialization .PERIOD now ,COMMA i took that and said ,COMMA ok ,COMMA what are the long-term trends in technology ?QUESTIONMARK 
that we see there's a general hammer ,COMMA and hammers become more and more specific over time .PERIOD 
there's obviously diversity .PERIOD huge numbers of things .PERIOD 
so the major trends in technology evolution actually are the same as in biological evolution .PERIOD the same drives that we see towards ubiquity ,COMMA towards diversity ,COMMA towards socialization ,COMMA towards complexity .PERIOD that is maybe not a big surprise because if we map out ,COMMA say ,COMMA the evolution of armor ,COMMA you can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary-type cladistic tree .PERIOD 
he has one of the world's largest collections - about <NUM> of them .PERIOD 
but the most interesting aspect about this is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom ,COMMA those indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet that was no longer made .PERIOD that does not happen in biology .PERIOD 
and when we take that ,COMMA we take this idea of what culture is doing and add it to what the long-term trajectory - again ,COMMA in life's evolution - we find that each case - each of the major transitions in life - what they're really about is accelerating and changing the way in which evolution happens .PERIOD 
so all these steps in evolution are increasing ,COMMA basically ,COMMA the evolution of evolvability .PERIOD 
so if you have life hacking - life means hacking ,COMMA the game of survival - then evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game .PERIOD 
and each time we make a new opportunity place ,COMMA we're allowing a platform to make new ones .PERIOD 
that's what technology wants .PERIOD 
i'm going ,COMMA my gosh !EXCLAMATIONMARK i had never seen anything like this in my life !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
and you walk up to the front of the tank .PERIOD then you realize that these animals all have different personalities :COLON some of them would hold their ground ,COMMA others would slink into the back of the tank and disappear in the rocks ,COMMA and one in particular ,COMMA this amazing animal .PERIOD 
and what i learned in school though was really beneficial .PERIOD 
if you're a wildlife filmmaker and you're going out into the field to film animals ,COMMA especially behavior ,COMMA it helps to have a fundamental background on who these animals are ,COMMA how they work and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a bit about their behaviors .PERIOD 
so we created a way to find out ,COMMA and i got my first look at that famous beak in action .PERIOD 
and octopus are ,COMMA they live in all the oceans .PERIOD 
and as you go deeper ,COMMA that lovely ,COMMA blue water you were launched in gives way to darker and darker blue .PERIOD 
and finally ,COMMA it's a rich lavender ,COMMA and after a couple of thousand feet ,COMMA it's ink black .PERIOD 
but we're just going to zip right past this area ,COMMA this area that includes about <NUM> percent of the living space on our planet and go to the mid-ocean ridge ,COMMA which i think is even more extraordinary .PERIOD 
and the top of this mountain range is splitting apart ,COMMA creating a rift valley .PERIOD 
the surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing .PERIOD 
and this kind of life and death of hydrothermal vent communities is going on every <NUM> or <NUM> years all along the ridge .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA encouragingly ,COMMA i've seen just the opposite .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA how it happened is the local community galvanized .PERIOD 
and these problems are so large and global ,COMMA and it's just overwhelming .PERIOD 
my answer to that is don't look at the big ,COMMA overwhelming issues of the world .PERIOD 
and we can make changes to our behavior that will influence and affect the environment ,COMMA like those people changed the health of that bay .PERIOD 
i was afraid of womanhood .PERIOD 
not that i'm not afraid now ,COMMA but i've learned to pretend .PERIOD 
i've learned to be flexible .PERIOD 
back in the <NUM> and <NUM> ,COMMA when i was growing up ,COMMA little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful and pretty and gentle and soft ,COMMA and we were supposed to fit into roles that were sort of shadowy - really not quite clear what we were supposed to be .PERIOD 
now my mother was different .PERIOD 
and i just ate it up .PERIOD 
because women are on the ground floor ,COMMA and we know the traditions so well ,COMMA we can bring a different voice to the table .PERIOD 
and then also my family was in chaos ,COMMA and i drew to try to bring my family together - - try to bring my family together with laughter .PERIOD 
but i feel blessed to be able to work with them .PERIOD 
two hundred years ago ,COMMA the united states was less than a few percent urbanized .PERIOD 
it's now more than <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
now listen to this :COLON every week for the foreseeable future ,COMMA until <NUM> ,COMMA every week more than a million people are being added to our cities .PERIOD 
however ,COMMA cities ,COMMA despite having this negative aspect to them ,COMMA are also the solution .PERIOD 
so we have this kind of dual nature .PERIOD 
that's the quest .PERIOD 
so here's two questions that i have in my head when i think about this problem .PERIOD 
we use them metaphorically - the dna of a company ,COMMA the metabolism of a city ,COMMA and so on - is that just bullshit ,COMMA metaphorical bullshit ,COMMA or is there serious substance to it ?QUESTIONMARK 
and if that is the case ,COMMA how come that it's very hard to kill a city ?QUESTIONMARK 
you could drop an atom bomb on a city ,COMMA and <NUM> years later it's surviving .PERIOD 
this is just a tiny range actually :COLON it's us mammals ;SEMICOLON we're one of these .PERIOD 
rat ,COMMA that's a rat - could have been you .PERIOD 
we're all pretty much the same .PERIOD 
and you see ,COMMA you're very familiar with this .PERIOD 
despite the fact that this is the most complex and diverse system in the universe ,COMMA there's an extraordinary simplicity being expressed by this .PERIOD 
so a wonderful thing about all of biology is that it expresses an extraordinary economy of scale .PERIOD 
and you're very familiar with these networks .PERIOD 
and here's the summary of what i'm saying .PERIOD 
heart rates are slower ;SEMICOLON you live longer ;SEMICOLON diffusion of oxygen and resources across membranes is slower ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
here it is ,COMMA which says that the bigger you are the more you have per capita ,COMMA unlike biology - higher wages ,COMMA more super-creative people per capita as you get bigger ,COMMA more patents per capita ,COMMA more crime per capita .PERIOD 
see companies ,COMMA they scale .PERIOD 
there it is :COLON after some little fluctuations at the beginning ,COMMA when companies are innovating ,COMMA they scale beautifully .PERIOD 
but you notice ,COMMA i've cheated ,COMMA because i've only gone up to <NUM> .PERIOD 
and i put in front of them an authentic experience that allowed them to learn for themselves .PERIOD 
the problem then becomes how do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful ,COMMA and they know what to do with it .PERIOD 
i moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that i knew that kids learned ,COMMA and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you are willing to let go of some of the paradigms of the past ,COMMA of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school and even when i was in school ,COMMA and to a moment when we have information surplus .PERIOD 
it asked them to create for themselves ,COMMA and it allowed them to fail ,COMMA process ,COMMA learn from .PERIOD 
ask them to go to places ,COMMA to see things for themselves ,COMMA to actually experience the learning ,COMMA to play ,COMMA to inquire .PERIOD 
this is one of my favorite photos ,COMMA because this was taken on tuesday ,COMMA when i asked the students to go to the polls .PERIOD 
there are words that we're truly afraid of .PERIOD 
this was an issue from <NUM> that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human .PERIOD 
regenerative medicine is what business week put up when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago .PERIOD 
and you can basically see that the richer a country is ,COMMA the older the people are within it .PERIOD 
and why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now ?QUESTIONMARK 
in <NUM> ,COMMA two workers per retiree in the u.s .PERIOD 
this is age versus cost of health care .PERIOD 
this video ,COMMA i think ,COMMA gets across the concept that i'm talking about quite dramatically .PERIOD 
the way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body .PERIOD 
in a child ,COMMA before the age of about six months ,COMMA if they lose their fingertip in an accident ,COMMA they'll re-grow their fingertip .PERIOD 
we heard yesterday about the importance of new materials .PERIOD 
i wouldn't be telling you this story if it weren't compelling .PERIOD 
this is a horse .PERIOD the horse is not in pain .PERIOD 
after treatment that's what it looks like .PERIOD 
he chills the dish ,COMMA it changes its properties and he peels it right out of the dish .PERIOD 
it's the coolest stuff .PERIOD 
in this case ,COMMA at the end of the bypass operation ,COMMA you're going to see the stem cells from the patient that were removed at the beginning of the procedure being injected directly into the heart of the patient .PERIOD 
this was a randomized trial .PERIOD 
there go the cells .PERIOD 
here's another example of stem-cell therapy that isn't quite clinical yet ,COMMA but i think very soon will be .PERIOD 
so you could go in ,COMMA you could get your tummy-tuck .PERIOD 
japan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age .PERIOD 
in the united states we've had a somewhat different approach .PERIOD 
but there's been no strategic investment to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way .PERIOD 
and these tedsters are - you know ,COMMA as innocent as that name sounds - these are the philanthropists and artists and scientists who sort of shape our world .PERIOD 
and what could i possibly have to say that would be distinguished enough to justify my participation in something like that ?QUESTIONMARK 
well my characters ,COMMA like the ones in my shows ,COMMA allow me to play with the spaces between those questions .PERIOD 
what i should tell you - what i should tell you is that they've each prepared their own little ted talks .PERIOD 
well you know ,COMMA she calls herself black - she's really more like a caramel color if you look at her .PERIOD 
frankly ,COMMA i'm kvelling just to be here with all the luminaries you have attending something like this ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
so many others you see ,COMMA they're just wonderful .PERIOD 
but anyway ,COMMA i should have started by saying just how lucky i feel .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA i couldn't have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA your parents must be very proud .PERIOD 
the point is ,COMMA i'm happy somebody has practical ideas to get us out of this mess .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA happy continued success .PERIOD 
sorry ,COMMA this is such a wonderful opportunity and everything ,COMMA to be here right now .PERIOD 
my name is noraida .PERIOD and i'm just - i'm so thrilled to be part of like your ted conference that you're doing and everything like that .PERIOD 
actually ,COMMA you could say i grew up in the capital of dominican republic ,COMMA otherwise known as washington heights in new york city .PERIOD 
and i think he's mexican ,COMMA so that's - honestly ,COMMA that's close enough for me right now .PERIOD so - i just - i'm sorry .PERIOD 
okay .PERIOD sorry .PERIOD so anyway ,COMMA what i was trying to say is that i really love ted .PERIOD 
like ,COMMA it's - i can't get over this right now .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA basically like da bomb - what dominican-american benevolent organization for mothers and babies does is ,COMMA basically ,COMMA we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise and who also happen to be mothers like me .PERIOD 
i come from a multicultural family .PERIOD 
and we were only <NUM> years old ,COMMA so it was not appropriate .PERIOD 
although ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it was wonderful .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA i just wanted to quickly say good evening .PERIOD 
but when sarah jones asked me to please come to ted ,COMMA i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA first ,COMMA i don't know that ,COMMA you know - before two years ago ,COMMA you would not find me in front of an audience of people ,COMMA much less like this because i did not like to give speeches because i feel that ,COMMA as an immigrant ,COMMA i do not have good english skills for speaking .PERIOD 
but that's where we had some problems .PERIOD 
the daughter's marriage is very special to the mom .PERIOD 
and i said ,COMMA yes ,COMMA men can be difficult ,COMMA but all women have to get used to that .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i always teach my kids to respect american ideas ,COMMA but i told my daughter that this is one exception - - that she is not gay ,COMMA she is just confused by this american problem .PERIOD 
thank you very ,COMMA very much .PERIOD i love you .PERIOD 
finished university education ,COMMA got a medical degree ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA critical poverty :COLON this slide is from a presentation i gave not that long ago .PERIOD gapminder.org tells the story of the gap between africa and the rest of the world in terms of health care .PERIOD 
yes ,COMMA i'm sorry if it upsets some of you ,COMMA but i think you need to see this .PERIOD that's the floor ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
because it's scary and it's expensive ,COMMA but we need to have it ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
that's mike ,COMMA mike comes out from mississippi .PERIOD 
see ,COMMA that's one of the problems we have in nigeria and in africa generally .PERIOD 
it looks like all these americans are here and yes ,COMMA one brit ,COMMA and he's not going to do anything - he thinks he's british actually ,COMMA and he's actually nigerian ,COMMA i just thought about that .PERIOD 
we eventually got it working ,COMMA is the truth ,COMMA but it was one of these .PERIOD even older than the one you saw .PERIOD 
no ?QUESTIONMARK yes ?QUESTIONMARK doesn't matter ,COMMA it worked .PERIOD 
and currently we're working on oxygen - oxygen delivery on-site .PERIOD 
so that's not new .PERIOD what we're doing is applying this technology to it .PERIOD 
these are members of my graduating class ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD 
and finally ,COMMA i get a call last year ,COMMA and then i have to go up after j.j. abrams .PERIOD 
hollywood gathers around power tables ,COMMA and the valley gathers around power tables .PERIOD 
but i'm actually here today to tell a story .PERIOD 
and what he said was ,COMMA he wasn't so much afraid that he might die ,COMMA but that he hadn't done the things that he wanted to with his life .PERIOD 
but for me ,COMMA personally ,COMMA it was a real change .PERIOD 
i went from living in a house with five guys in palo alto and living off their leftovers ,COMMA to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources .PERIOD 
connecting them together through conferences - like a ted - brings so many powerful connections ,COMMA or through the world forum on social entrepreneurship that my foundation does at oxford every year .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA in <NUM> ,COMMA i started to make my way around los angeles to talk about the idea of a pro-social media company and i was met with a lot of encouragement .PERIOD 
one of the lines of encouragement that i heard over and over was ,COMMA the streets of hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you ,COMMA who think you're going to come to this town and make movies .PERIOD 
one of these films in particular ,COMMA called north country ,COMMA was actually kind of a box office disaster .PERIOD 
and that to me ,COMMA spoke volumes ,COMMA because it's - the film started about a true-life story about a woman who was harassed ,COMMA sued her employer ,COMMA led to a landmark case that led to the equal opportunity act ,COMMA and the violence against women act and others .PERIOD 
at that point ,COMMA i thought i knew something about global warming .PERIOD 
and we have <NUM> films in production right now ,COMMA and dozens others in development .PERIOD 
and one thing that i've learned is that there's never one right way to make change .PERIOD 
and i can imagine ,COMMA if we do this ,COMMA the headlines in <NUM> years might read something like these :COLON new aids cases in africa fall to zero ,COMMA u.s. imports its last barrel of oil - - israelis and palestinians celebrate <NUM> years of peaceful coexistence .PERIOD 
and i believe that ,COMMA working together ,COMMA we can make all of these things happen .PERIOD 
the next day ,COMMA all the artists were invited to join mandela in robben island ,COMMA where he was going to give a conference to the world's press ,COMMA standing in front of his former prison cell .PERIOD 
he was wearing a t-shirt like the one i wear now .PERIOD 
i've subsequently become an envoy for scotland and hiv .PERIOD 
i think that's fair to say ,COMMA it's almost everyone in the hall .PERIOD 
but now we have this new layer of private sovereignty in cyberspace .PERIOD 
and their decisions about software coding ,COMMA engineering ,COMMA design ,COMMA terms of service all act as a kind of law that shapes what we can and cannot do with our digital lives .PERIOD 
the reality is that even in democratic societies today ,COMMA we do not have good answers for how you balance the need for security and law enforcement on one hand and protection of civil liberties and free speech on the other in our digital networks .PERIOD 
this is a map of social networks worldwide ,COMMA and certainly facebook has conquered much of the world - which is either a good or a bad thing ,COMMA depending on how you like the way facebook manages its service .PERIOD 
in plain english ,COMMA that means censorship and surveillance of their users .PERIOD 
this has a chilling effect on people's ability to use the internet to hold government accountable .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
comparable ,COMMA in its own very peculiar way ,COMMA to the achievements of microsoft or google .PERIOD 
here are some of those same weightlifters after their <NUM> makeover .PERIOD 
and so i resolved to travel around the world examining this global criminal underworld by talking to policemen ,COMMA by talking to victims ,COMMA by talking to consumers of illicit goods and services .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA organized crime in a globalizing world operates in the same way as any other business .PERIOD 
and it is this western desire to consume that is the primary driver of international organized crime .PERIOD 
and as a consequence of this trade ,COMMA britain alone lost eight billion dollars in revenue .PERIOD 
so what were these guys doing with all the money they were making ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA this is where we come to globalization ,COMMA because that was not just the deregulation of global trade .PERIOD 
this one ,COMMA however ,COMMA is in central british columbia where i photographed it .PERIOD 
what they've done is they've shifted their operations .PERIOD 
people don't smoke as much dope ,COMMA or visit prostitutes quite so frequently during a recession .PERIOD 
and so as soon as i saw this drop into my inbox ,COMMA i dispatched it hastily to the recycle bin and spared myself a very nasty infection .PERIOD 
it's such a large conference .PERIOD 
mark serfaas .PERIOD it's pretty cool ,COMMA huh ?QUESTIONMARK pursuing happiness .PERIOD 
i mean - no ,COMMA i mean like in the ted sense ?QUESTIONMARK 
<NUM> - am i good ?QUESTIONMARK 
and my name ,COMMA and it would tell me .PERIOD and i have to tell you ,COMMA right now ,COMMA this is an unadulterated piece of software ,COMMA this is a real internet browser and this is an actual google site ,COMMA and we're going to test it out live today .PERIOD 
am i feeling lucky ?QUESTIONMARK 
ze frank :COLON oh .PERIOD amazing .PERIOD 
needless to say ,COMMA i was able to leave my job .PERIOD 
four years later ,COMMA i still get probably two or three hundred emails a day from people i don't know ,COMMA and it's been an amazing opportunity to kind of get to know different cultures ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
and that was embarrassing .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA the scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool .PERIOD 
i mean this is incredible .PERIOD this is an 11-year-old girl - drew this and submitted it .PERIOD it's just gorgeous .PERIOD 
none of the haikus were written by the same person ,COMMA and in fact ,COMMA no line was - you know ,COMMA each line is contributed by a different person at a different - at a different time .PERIOD 
it dances to music .PERIOD lotte reiniger ,COMMA an amazing shadow puppeteer in the <NUM> ,COMMA that started doing more elaborate things .PERIOD 
chris anderson :COLON ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA mr. ze frank .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA this is <NUM> .PERIOD 
so i'm going to talk about it .PERIOD 
we get the geneticists keeping on telling us how extremely closely we are related - hardly any genes of difference ,COMMA very ,COMMA very closely related .PERIOD 
i'm not talking about airy-fairy stuff about culture or psychology ,COMMA or behavior .PERIOD 
professor tobias came over from south africa and spoke to university college london .PERIOD 
you've believed it through generations .PERIOD 
so that is what they have done now .PERIOD 
aaron filler from harvard said ,COMMA isn't it time we stopped talking about selective pressures ?QUESTIONMARK 
he kept it to himself for <NUM> years .PERIOD 
and at that time ,COMMA it became set in stone :COLON the aquatic theory should be dumped with the ufos and the yetis ,COMMA as part of the lunatic fringe of science .PERIOD 
i suggested it and people said ,COMMA no no no .PERIOD 
peals of merry laughter !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
that crazy woman .PERIOD she's off again .PERIOD she'll say anything won't she ?QUESTIONMARK 
this has come'round to be that all those naked pachyderms have aquatic ancestors .PERIOD 
so this is a close connection between nakedness and water .PERIOD 
here you can't find anybody to compare it with ,COMMA because we're the only animal that walks upright on two legs .PERIOD 
there is only one circumstance in which they always ,COMMA all of them ,COMMA walk on two legs ,COMMA and that is when they are wading through water .PERIOD 
david attenborough thinks it's significant ,COMMA as the possible beginning of our bipedalism .PERIOD 
in the whale it's complete :COLON no fat inside at all ,COMMA all in blubber outside .PERIOD 
we can speak .PERIOD 
try to imagine a gorilla performing the same maneuver ,COMMA and you can see that ,COMMA compared with gorilla ,COMMA we are halfway to being shaped like a fish .PERIOD 
there is nothing there .PERIOD 
i don't believe it .PERIOD 
there was professor tobias .PERIOD he's come over .PERIOD 
daniel dennett ,COMMA he's come over .PERIOD 
so the third thing that might happen is a very beautiful thing .PERIOD 
i can tell you that in three words .PERIOD 
the textbooks don't mention it .PERIOD 
and it's pretty simple .PERIOD 
everybody's got one - all of you .PERIOD 
and so when working as an interaction designer ,COMMA or as an artist who deals with participation - creating things that live on ,COMMA in or around the human form - it's really a powerful space to work within .PERIOD 
and it is a tool that actually enables one to listen to their own innards .PERIOD 
when i meet a glacier for the very first time ,COMMA what do i do ?QUESTIONMARK 
do i carve a message in the snow ?QUESTIONMARK 
but really the most satisfying experience i've had is the act of listening ,COMMA which is what we need in any good relationship .PERIOD 
and just as with the wall ,COMMA how i wanted to be more wall-like ,COMMA with this project ,COMMA i'd actually like to take more a of glacial pace .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA how do you do that ?QUESTIONMARK 
that doesn't move .PERIOD 
here's my promise to you :COLON if you are consistent and do this ,COMMA within three months the elected official will start calling you when that issue comes up and say ,COMMA what do you think ?QUESTIONMARK 
now ,COMMA when you approach these animals ,COMMA you need to understand there's a dangerous end to them ,COMMA and you also need to approach them with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness .PERIOD 
if you had the right information ,COMMA you would have done the right thing .PERIOD 
if they follow protocol ,COMMA they'll pick up the phone and say ,COMMA hey ,COMMA do you have the original ?QUESTIONMARK 
and you actually get into the folder that the elected official actually has to read .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what your letter means :COLON i've got to tell you ,COMMA we are all in a party ,COMMA and political officials are the pinatas .PERIOD 
living systems are in constant conversation with the natural world ,COMMA through sets of chemical reactions called metabolism .PERIOD 
and this is the conversion of one group of substances into another ,COMMA either through the production or the absorption of energy .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA that's exactly the kind of process that i'm interested in ,COMMA when we're thinking about sustainable materials .PERIOD 
it is able to move around its environment .PERIOD 
it can follow chemical gradients .PERIOD 
it can undergo complex reactions ,COMMA some of which are happily architectural .PERIOD 
here ,COMMA this is a protocell ,COMMA and it's vigorously shedding this skin .PERIOD 
the protocells can actually move away from the light .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this is really interesting .PERIOD now we have an architecture that connects a city to the natural world in a very direct and immediate way .PERIOD 
this is a river .PERIOD 
the reasons vary state to state ,COMMA but mostly in the details .PERIOD 
but as more people showed up wanting water ,COMMA the folks who were there first got a little concerned ,COMMA and in <NUM> ,COMMA montana passed its first water law .PERIOD 
there's another thing happening around the country ,COMMA which is that companies are starting to get concerned about their water footprint .PERIOD 
so what can they do about this remaining water footprint that can have serious effects on the ecosystem ?QUESTIONMARK 
he doesn't lose the water right ,COMMA he just chooses to apply that right ,COMMA or some portion of it ,COMMA to the stream ,COMMA instead of to the land .PERIOD 
this guy's measuring the water that this leaves in the stream .PERIOD 
he's by far the happiest man ever measured by science .PERIOD 
compassion is fun .PERIOD 
therefore ,COMMA to create the conditions for global compassion ,COMMA all we have to do is to reframe compassion as something that is fun .PERIOD 
these are leaders who are highly ambitious for the greater good .PERIOD 
and they ,COMMA according to the research ,COMMA make the best business leaders .PERIOD 
and if you look at these qualities in the context of compassion ,COMMA we find that the cognitive and affective components of compassion - understanding people and empathizing with people - inhibits ,COMMA tones down ,COMMA what i call the excessive self-obsession that's in us ,COMMA therefore creating the conditions for humility .PERIOD 
this awareness of serving the greater good is very self-inspiring and it creates fertile ground for compassion to grow in .PERIOD 
that's one .PERIOD 
the second ingredient is autonomy .PERIOD 
and this also creates the conditions for compassion in the workplace .PERIOD 
i found this to be true ,COMMA both on the individual level and at a corporate level .PERIOD 
and what i recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end torture as an investigative tool .PERIOD 
we often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst ,COMMA but ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA <NUM> percent of torture today is not for political prisoners .PERIOD 
so it's just a place where there was no rule of law .PERIOD 
in burundi i walked into a prison and it wasn't a 12-year-old boy ,COMMA it was an 8-year-old boy for stealing a mobile phone .PERIOD 
and when i walked up to the prison director ,COMMA i said ,COMMA you've got to let her out .PERIOD 
so the pieces are ,COMMA not only the training of the lawyers ,COMMA but us finding a way to systematically implement early access to counsel ,COMMA because they are the safeguard in the system for people who are being tortured .PERIOD 
but the third and most important thing is that we make a commitment to this .PERIOD 
and the reason that i think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery ,COMMA or end apartheid .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA you know ,COMMA there's bars .PERIOD and by the time that vishna was getting bigger ,COMMA which means what gets bigger ?QUESTIONMARK your head gets bigger .PERIOD 
so he would come to the first bar ,COMMA the second bar and then the third bar ,COMMA and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through ,COMMA and come back ,COMMA third ,COMMA second ,COMMA first .PERIOD and he would grab my pinkie ,COMMA because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit .PERIOD 
and i will do the one thing that i can do .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
we were in queens ,COMMA we were building the big ,COMMA big ,COMMA big ,COMMA big building in midtown ,COMMA so we were in the small ,COMMA small ,COMMA small boondocks .PERIOD 
but it's not only that .PERIOD 
in italy ,COMMA in milan especially ,COMMA contemporary art really doesn't have that much of a place .PERIOD 
they tried to make a toddler's gas mask in such a way that the toddler can be held by the parent because proximity of the body is so important .PERIOD 
instead ,COMMA she said ,COMMA no ,COMMA no .PERIOD work and leisure can be together .PERIOD 
yeah ,COMMA that's particularly gorgeous - it's the tv dinner of <NUM> .PERIOD 
i would like ,COMMA instead ,COMMA to talk about how great some designers are .PERIOD 
it's a long story because it started before <NUM> and it was called emergency .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA designers sometimes don't do things that are immediately functional ,COMMA but they're functional to our understanding of issues .PERIOD 
this is cindy van den bremen ,COMMA who is a dutch designer that's done this series of capsters .PERIOD 
they range from this fluffy toy that is about hugging you - because autistic children like to be hugged tight ,COMMA so it has a spring inside - all the way to this doll with a mirror so the child can see him or herself in the mirror and regain a sense of self .PERIOD 
design really looks upon the whole world and it considers the world in all of its different ranges .PERIOD 
and it was really interesting because i was the last speaker and before me there were people that were really talking about luxury ,COMMA and i didn't want to be a party pooper but at the same time i felt that i had to kind of bring back the discourse to reality .PERIOD 
the rhythm of the sinusoids has changed tremendously ,COMMA just like the rhythm of our life in the past <NUM> years ,COMMA so i'm not sure anymore what the wavelength is .PERIOD 
but design and science and the possibility of visualizing different scales ,COMMA and therefore ,COMMA really work at the scale of the very small to make it very big and very meaningful .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA africa is a complex continent full of contradictions ,COMMA as you can see .PERIOD 
and i want to tell you that this is my story ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
and it's the story of many of the africans who are here .PERIOD 
and my father said ,COMMA ok ,COMMA listen .PERIOD 
so we went to the school ,COMMA and because we were nobodies ,COMMA and because we didn't have privilege ,COMMA and because my father didn't have the right last name ,COMMA he was treated like dirt .PERIOD 
but the money ran out .PERIOD 
you don't see the blogger ,COMMA you don't see the harvard-educated lawyer ,COMMA the vibrant person ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
and you didn't know about the windmill ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i was just moved .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what is to be done ?QUESTIONMARK 
and this is an example ,COMMA you know ,COMMA blogging is one way of doing that .PERIOD 
so we need to start getting better .PERIOD 
and going back to the point i was trying to make ,COMMA this is the swahili wikipedia .PERIOD 
swahili is spoken by about <NUM> million people in east africa .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA that's a start ,COMMA and we've heard of all their other initiatives .PERIOD 
i walked away from a job with one of the top firms in d.c. covington and burling ,COMMA six figures .PERIOD 
what are they doing ?QUESTIONMARK 
practically .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA when i was a first-year student in law school ,COMMA my mom's business had collapsed ,COMMA so i was supporting her .PERIOD 
my sister was struggling to get through undergrad .PERIOD 
an example .PERIOD this man changed my life .PERIOD 
i said ,COMMA i want to be a lawyer .PERIOD 
and i'm like ,COMMA because i'm here and it's cheap ,COMMA and you know ,COMMA i kind of like pittsburgh .PERIOD 
i was also building something called the copenhagen wheel ,COMMA which is just a really beautiful ,COMMA beautiful electric bike at a lab at mit called senseable city lab .PERIOD 
this is a place where my friend ,COMMA abhishek sen was interning .PERIOD 
and that's his actual photograph .PERIOD 
she told me that this is how you would typically test for anemia .PERIOD 
but this is not available in parol .PERIOD 
but fundamentally ,COMMA what i believe is that the map behind of me is called basically the map of anemia .PERIOD 
and when i walked in ,COMMA she was already at the table .PERIOD 
and she said ,COMMA i saw your talk live-streamed .PERIOD 
so of course ,COMMA the only thing i could think of to say at that point was ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA me neither .PERIOD 
why did you bring this up ?QUESTIONMARK have you lost your mind ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i said ,COMMA i'm just thinking about it a little bit .PERIOD 
and my life did end when that happened .PERIOD 
the first is vulnerability is not weakness .PERIOD 
the majority of people .PERIOD 
i define vulnerability as emotional risk ,COMMA exposure ,COMMA uncertainty .PERIOD 
i am not a natural vulnerability researcher .PERIOD 
so when i became vulnerability ted ,COMMA like an action figure - like ninja barbie ,COMMA but i'm vulnerability ted - i thought ,COMMA i'm going to leave that shame stuff behind ,COMMA because i spent six years studying shame before i really started writing and talking about vulnerability .PERIOD 
but in surviving this last year ,COMMA i was reminded of a cardinal rule - not a research rule ,COMMA but a moral imperative from my upbringing - you've got to dance with the one who brung ya .PERIOD 
it is to put on some galoshes and walk through and find our way around .PERIOD 
here's why .PERIOD 
i can't wait to tell people this .PERIOD 
the credit goes to the man in the arena whose face is marred with dust and blood and sweat .PERIOD 
that's what life is about ,COMMA about daring greatly ,COMMA about being in the arena .PERIOD 
i know your dad never paid attention ,COMMA even when you made cfo .PERIOD 
shame drives two big tapes - never good enough and ,COMMA if you can talk it out of that one ,COMMA who do you think you are ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's uncomfortable ,COMMA but it's adaptive .PERIOD 
i did not interview men for the first four years of my study .PERIOD 
and he said ,COMMA that's convenient .PERIOD 
so i started interviewing men and asking questions .PERIOD 
if you put shame in a petri dish ,COMMA it needs three things to grow exponentially :COLON secrecy ,COMMA silence and judgment .PERIOD 
if you put the same amount of shame in a petri dish and douse it with empathy ,COMMA it can't survive .PERIOD 
and i know it's seductive to stand outside the arena ,COMMA because i think i did it my whole life ,COMMA and think to myself ,COMMA i'm going to go in there and kick some ass when i'm bulletproof and when i'm perfect .PERIOD 
we want you to go in .PERIOD 
so maybe we'll try it once - to fly a smartbird .PERIOD 
we have to turn it ,COMMA go up and go down .PERIOD 
bruno giussani :COLON markus ,COMMA i think that we should fly it once more .PERIOD 
i think first it's important for us to recognize what it is to be blind .PERIOD 
today ,COMMA we're reaching not even <NUM> percent of them .PERIOD 
he had to mortgage all his life savings to make a bank loan .PERIOD 
it is ourselves we are healing .PERIOD 
this helped us build a very ethical and very highly patient-centric organization and systems that support it .PERIOD 
so what is in this video is a surgeon operating ,COMMA and then you see on the other side ,COMMA another patient is getting ready .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA of course ,COMMA one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away what you have as a surplus .PERIOD 
and what we did was a couple of very counter-intuitive things .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA over time ,COMMA we were able to bring down the cost significantly to about two percent of what it used to be when we started out .PERIOD 
so we're really comparing apples to apples .PERIOD 
so i want to end my talk leaving this thought and challenge to you .PERIOD 
dr. v :COLON when you grow in spiritual consciousness ,COMMA we identify with all that is in the world so there is no exploitation .PERIOD 
so the question is :COLON how do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical ?QUESTIONMARK 
let me show you the weight-shifting mobile .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA mass is the first thing ;SEMICOLON the second thing ,COMMA that's shape .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA it's a mobile phone-shaped box ,COMMA and this one can change its shape .PERIOD 
as humans ,COMMA we are social ,COMMA we are empathic ,COMMA and that's great .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA that's very intuitive ,COMMA and that's what we want .PERIOD 
the brown administration ,COMMA and a bunch of my friends ,COMMA basically leveled the energy efficiency of california ,COMMA so it's the same now ,COMMA <NUM> years later ,COMMA even though our economy has gone up <NUM> percent ,COMMA per capita .PERIOD 
the dominant demographic event of our time is this screamingly rapid urbanization that we have going on .PERIOD 
it's interesting ,COMMA because history is driven to a large degree by the size of cities .PERIOD 
people are following opportunity into town .PERIOD 
it is not the case that slums undermine prosperity ,COMMA not the working slums ;SEMICOLON they help create prosperity .PERIOD 
these people are valuable as a group .PERIOD 
you look at that lane on the right .PERIOD 
they're doing it through an outlaw thing ,COMMA the informal economy .PERIOD 
and young people in brand new cities they're inventing ,COMMA doing new things ,COMMA in the south .PERIOD 
climate is a profoundly complex ,COMMA nonlinear system ,COMMA full of runaway positive feedbacks ,COMMA hidden thresholds and irrevocable tipping points .PERIOD 
we're going to keep being surprised .PERIOD and almost all the surprises are going to be bad ones .PERIOD 
if all of the electricity you used in your lifetime was nuclear ,COMMA the amount of waste that would be added up would fit in a coke can .PERIOD 
it's interesting ,COMMA say ,COMMA to take a 25-megawatt ,COMMA <NUM> million watts ,COMMA and you compare it to the standard big iron of an ordinary westinghouse or ariva ,COMMA which is <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> billion watts .PERIOD 
these things are way smaller .PERIOD they're much more adaptable .PERIOD 
this is a list of them .PERIOD 
and as those events keep happening we're going to say ,COMMA okay ,COMMA what can we do about that really ?QUESTIONMARK 
here is an example that climatologists like a lot ,COMMA one of the dozens of geoengineering ideas .PERIOD 
now this shouldn't come as a surprise to us .PERIOD 
as with bp ,COMMA the hole does get plugged ,COMMA at least temporarily ,COMMA but not before exacting a tremendous price .PERIOD 
now both of these options - the boy genius and the scammer - are going to make you vastly overconfident and therefore more prone to taking even bigger risks in the future .PERIOD 
the gulf of mexico is a very big ocean .PERIOD 
in other words ,COMMA the ocean is big ;SEMICOLON she can take it .PERIOD

there will be two passes here ,COMMA in the same patient ,COMMA from the same hole .PERIOD 
this was done under local anesthesia ,COMMA as an outpatient .PERIOD 
in the last decade there's been an explosion of use of bone marrow stem cells to treat the patient's other diseases such as heart disease ,COMMA vascular disease ,COMMA orthopedics ,COMMA tissue engineering ,COMMA even in neurology to treat parkinson's and diabetes .PERIOD 
we've just come out ,COMMA we're commercializing ,COMMA this year ,COMMA generation <NUM> of the marrow miner .PERIOD 
that was all done on a machine that looks like this .PERIOD 
so now what we do is we take a genome ,COMMA we make maybe <NUM> copies of it ,COMMA we cut all those copies up into little 50-base reads ,COMMA and then we sequence them ,COMMA massively parallel .PERIOD 
and he sequenced ,COMMA he took skin cells ,COMMA healthy skin ,COMMA and cancerous bone marrow ,COMMA and he sequenced the whole genomes of both of them in a couple of weeks ,COMMA no big deal .PERIOD 
and so they were given l-dopa ,COMMA and their symptoms did improve ,COMMA but they weren't totally asymptomatic .PERIOD 
and so what he did was he got his kids sequenced .PERIOD 
thankfully ,COMMA i was able to answer a ,COMMA and i say that honestly in case my life insurance agent is listening .PERIOD 
not hard to imagine .PERIOD my company has software that does this right now .PERIOD 
it can be summed up in a single sentence :COLON everything that can happen ,COMMA does .PERIOD 
and things can happen only if these interactions are perfectly balanced .PERIOD 
all of these matter particles come in left- and right-handed varieties ,COMMA and have anti-particle partners that carry opposite charges .PERIOD 
these matter particles all interact with the various force particles .PERIOD 
the most important thing to understand here is that there's a different kind of charge associated with each of these forces .PERIOD 
a particle that hasn't been seen yet ,COMMA but we're pretty sure exists ,COMMA is the higgs particle ,COMMA which gives masses to all these other particles .PERIOD 
and it seems strange that nature would have so many elementary particles .PERIOD 
the most familiar charge is electric charge .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA it turns out the electric charge is actually a combination of two other charges :COLON hypercharge and weak charge .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA this weak force particle and its anti-particle can be created in a collision .PERIOD 
one of the weak particles could decay into an electron and an anti-neutrino ,COMMA and these three still add to zero total charge .PERIOD 
so there's an old idea in particle physics that this known pattern of charges ,COMMA which is not very symmetric ,COMMA could emerge from a more perfect pattern that gets broken - similar to how the higgs particle breaks the electroweak pattern to give electromagnetism .PERIOD 
this particular choice corresponds to a grand unified theory introduced by pati and salam in <NUM> .PERIOD 
the larger pattern allows us to predict the existence of particles that have never been seen .PERIOD 
these particles are not uniquely identified by their six charges .PERIOD 
each point in this pattern corresponds to a symmetry of this very complex and beautiful shape .PERIOD 
and this idea that nature is described by mathematics is not at all new .PERIOD 
in <NUM> ,COMMA galileo wrote this :COLON nature's grand book ,COMMA which stands continually open to our gaze ,COMMA is written in the language of mathematics .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA of course ,COMMA bad for me personally .PERIOD 
in this regard ,COMMA new physics theories are a lot like start-up companies .PERIOD 
as with any large investment ,COMMA it can be emotionally difficult to abandon a line of research when it isn't working out .PERIOD 
i try to balance my life equally between physics ,COMMA love and surfing - my own three charge directions .PERIOD 
and that shape has remarkable similarities - and the way it fits into this <NUM> pattern could be the rest of the picture .PERIOD 
they are more like us than any other living creature ,COMMA and we've heard about that during this ted conference .PERIOD 
chimpanzees ,COMMA i believe ,COMMA more than any other living creature ,COMMA have helped us to understand that ,COMMA after all ,COMMA there is no sharp line between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom .PERIOD 
there isn't time to go into it ,COMMA but it's including things like tree nurseries ,COMMA methods of farming most suitable to this now very degraded ,COMMA almost desert-like land up in these mountains .PERIOD 
ways of reclaiming overused farmland ,COMMA so that within two years they can again be productive .PERIOD 
perhaps build some schoolrooms .PERIOD 
and we've got ,COMMA as is the case around the world ,COMMA about <NUM> percent of all loans returned .PERIOD 
and as a result of this program ,COMMA something's happening for conservation .PERIOD 
what's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these <NUM> villages ,COMMA instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys - and by the way ,COMMA many of the staff are now tanzanian - but when we began the tacare program ,COMMA it was a tanzanian team going into the villages .PERIOD 
and everywhere there were these terrible problems .PERIOD 
and you know the kind i'm talking about .PERIOD i'm talking about pollution .PERIOD 
the water - water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues that we're going to face in this century - and everywhere water is being polluted by agricultural ,COMMA industrial and household chemicals that still are being sprayed around the world ,COMMA seemingly with the inability to profit from past experience .PERIOD 
in many parts of sub-saharan africa ,COMMA the droughts are so much worse .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA do you think there could be some kind of disconnect between this extraordinarily clever brain ,COMMA the kind of brain that the ted technologies exemplify ,COMMA and the human heart ?QUESTIONMARK talking about it in the non-scientific term ,COMMA in terms of love and compassion .PERIOD is there some disconnect ?QUESTIONMARK 
we have compromised their future .PERIOD 
hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through and can make this a better world for all living things .PERIOD 
one of their projects will be to help animals - not just wildlife ,COMMA domestic animals as well .PERIOD 
you can't come to a conference like ted and not have hope ,COMMA can you ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i mean ,COMMA think of the technologies .PERIOD 
how many of us have children or grandchildren ,COMMA nieces ,COMMA nephews ?QUESTIONMARK 
people like this are so inspirational .PERIOD 
and i hope that some of us can get together and talk about some of these things ,COMMA especially the roots and shoots program .PERIOD 
and it was very ,COMMA very exciting for me to meet her and see just one example of how young people ,COMMA when they are empowered ,COMMA given the opportunity to take action ,COMMA to make the world a better place ,COMMA truly are our hope for tomorrow .PERIOD 
but other than letting some of you live out your fantasy of looking as cool as tom cruise in minority report ,COMMA the reason why we're really excited about this device is that it really can act as one of these sixth-sense devices that gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of you .PERIOD 
you can get video annotations of the event that you're reading about you can get the latest sports scores etc .PERIOD 
i then ,COMMA in the last few years ,COMMA learned about the pacific garbage patch and the gyre .PERIOD 
and the bigger picture is :COLON we need to find a way to turn off the faucet .PERIOD 
it's not just that gyre of plastic that i'm concerned about - it's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket .PERIOD 
you put something in a bin and you don't have to think about it again .PERIOD 
and i'm sure you'll feel that it's from a safe source .PERIOD 
but what if it wasn't ?QUESTIONMARK 
the smallest bacteria is about <NUM> nanometers .PERIOD

i am the mother of zacarias moussaoui .PERIOD 
my son ,COMMA i don't know where he is .PERIOD 
so that's why i decided to tell my story ,COMMA so that my suffering is something positive for other women .PERIOD 
we must be hand-in-hand and do something together .PERIOD 
so if i can save one of the young girls ,COMMA and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as i did ,COMMA well this is something good .PERIOD 
i would like to say that i have learned so much from aicha ,COMMA starting with that day we had our very first meeting with other family members - which was a very private meeting with security ,COMMA because it was november <NUM> ,COMMA and ,COMMA frankly ,COMMA we were afraid of the super-patriotism of that time in the country - those of us family members .PERIOD 
why did we want to meet her ?QUESTIONMARK 
and what happened then is we all told our stories ,COMMA and we all connected as human beings .PERIOD 
i never had met someone with such a hard life ,COMMA from such a totally different culture and environment from my own .PERIOD 
and these are always periods ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA accompanied by turbulence ,COMMA and all too often by blood .PERIOD

it's also moving vertically .PERIOD 
my guess is ,COMMA for what it's worth ,COMMA is that the united states will remain the most powerful nation on earth for the next <NUM> years ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA but the context in which she holds her power has now radically altered ;SEMICOLON it has radically changed .PERIOD 
but that's not a usual case in history .PERIOD

collective security is not enough .PERIOD 
peace has come to northern ireland because both sides realized that the zero-sum game couldn't work .PERIOD 
and so suddenly ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA what has been the proposition of visionaries and poets down the ages becomes something we have to take seriously as a matter of public policy .PERIOD 
i started with a poem ,COMMA i'll end with one .PERIOD

they know how to set up their life in the right way so they have the right outlook .PERIOD 
you know the two most dangerous years in your life are the year you're born ,COMMA because of infant mortality ,COMMA and the year you retire .PERIOD 
and they have strategies to keep from overeating ,COMMA little things that nudge them away from the table at the right time .PERIOD 
and then the foundation of all this is how they connect .PERIOD 
diets don't work .PERIOD no diet in the history of the world has ever worked for more than two percent of the population .PERIOD

so the grain markets were to the south of the city .PERIOD

and if we look at an image of smithfield in <NUM> you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this and be unaware of where your food came from .PERIOD 
it even got built ,COMMA but nothing to do with this vision that howard had .PERIOD 
so i've come up with an alternative ,COMMA which is sitopia ,COMMA from the ancient greek ,COMMA sitos for food ,COMMA and topos for place .PERIOD 
i believe we already live in sitopia .PERIOD 
so if we were to do that ,COMMA what might sitopia look like ?QUESTIONMARK 
because without these kinds of people we can't have places like this .PERIOD

i sometimes see when i'm speaking to a congregation of religious people a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces because people often want to be right instead .PERIOD 
and so we have a choice ,COMMA it seems to me .PERIOD

she parks her dirigible ,COMMA lowers the anchor rope and climbs down for a closer look inside .PERIOD 
the text here is right side and upside down so that you are forced to turn the book around ,COMMA and you can see it from ground point of view and from her point of view - looking in the hole ,COMMA getting a different kind of perspective ,COMMA moving you around the space .PERIOD particularly appropriate in a building that can contain perfectly a sphere dimensions of the diameter being the same as the distance from the center of the floor to the center of the oculus .PERIOD 
everything he sees from this point on is slightly affected by the linguine ,COMMA but keeps on moving because this guy's got a job to do .PERIOD 
then i thought ,COMMA wait a minute ,COMMA what am i doing ?QUESTIONMARK 
if i do a foldout page on the left-hand side and let you just unfold it ,COMMA you see behind it what i mean by scar tissue .PERIOD 
pigeon's progress struck me as a catchy title .PERIOD 
you can see the tombs and pines and so on and so forth along the way .PERIOD 
this is something that's a little bit unusual .PERIOD 
this is one of those things i show to my students because it's a complete bastardization - a denial of any rules of perspective .PERIOD 
i have all the pieces :COLON there's santa maria della pace ,COMMA there's a soccer ball ,COMMA there's a little bit of a bird's wing - nothing's happening ,COMMA so i had to rethink it .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
so there's something super interesting about natural systems .PERIOD 
the first two are the macrobot and decibot .PERIOD 
one of them is the input from the user ,COMMA as you're building your bricks .PERIOD 
so each chain ,COMMA or each element ,COMMA wants to turn right or left .PERIOD 
you're telling each unit if it should turn right or left .PERIOD 
so you can basically program any three-dimensional shape - or one-dimensional ,COMMA two-dimensional - up into this chain completely passively .PERIOD 
at the end of the lecture they asked a number of questions ,COMMA but there was one that's really stuck with me since then .PERIOD 
and he reached the point where he felt that there must be something out there that was smaller than the smallest forms of life that were ever known - bacteria ,COMMA at the time .PERIOD 
as we started to look at this information ,COMMA we would see that about <NUM> percent of the genetic information in your nose doesn't match anything that we've ever seen before - no plant ,COMMA animal ,COMMA fungus ,COMMA virus or bacteria .PERIOD 
so can we have the lights off ,COMMA please ,COMMA so we can see it ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA not quite ,COMMA not quite perfect - you see ,COMMA in intergalactic space - intergalactic space is completely dark ,COMMA pitch dark .PERIOD 
that's how big and how dark the universe is .PERIOD 
and that is how un-typical this place is .PERIOD 
now that is knowledge .PERIOD and if that weren't amazing enough ,COMMA the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the other is increasing with time .PERIOD that is the growth of knowledge .PERIOD 
now how does the solar system - and our environment ,COMMA in the form of us - acquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA one thing that's true about stephen hawking's remark - i mean ,COMMA it is true ,COMMA but it's the wrong emphasis .PERIOD one thing that's true about it is that it doesn't do it with any special physics .PERIOD there's no special dispensation ,COMMA no miracles involved .PERIOD it does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance .PERIOD 
one of them is matter ,COMMA because the growth of knowledge is a form of information processing .PERIOD information processing is computation ,COMMA computation requires a computer - there's no known way of making a computer without matter .PERIOD 
and the same - well ,COMMA if we could do that we'd automatically have an energy supply ,COMMA because the transmutation would be a fusion reactor - and evidence ?QUESTIONMARK 
and with a more powerful telescope ,COMMA you'll be able to see stars ,COMMA and planets .PERIOD 
and locally there you could build particle accelerators ,COMMA and learn elementary particle physics ,COMMA and chemistry ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD 
the danger is not at all unprecedented .PERIOD species go extinct all the time .PERIOD

it's only <NUM> years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a free-living organism ,COMMA that of haemophilus influenzae .PERIOD 
we can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours .PERIOD 
and we started the sorcerer ii expedition ,COMMA where we were ,COMMA as with great oceanographic expeditions ,COMMA trying to sample the ocean every <NUM> miles .PERIOD 
and with doing this ,COMMA we've made some amazing discoveries .PERIOD 
i view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution .PERIOD 
transposons are just small pieces of dna that randomly insert in the genetic code .PERIOD 
we found that synthesizing accurate dna in large pieces was extremely difficult .PERIOD 
and there's only two countries ,COMMA the u.s. and the former soviet union ,COMMA that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents .PERIOD 
i think future engineered species could be the source of food ,COMMA hopefully a source of energy ,COMMA environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry .PERIOD 
it was actually a very strange study ,COMMA because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books ,COMMA and they couldn't find anything in them prohibiting making life ,COMMA so it must be ok .PERIOD the only ultimate concerns were biological warfare aspects of this ,COMMA but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments for the reasons we were doing them .PERIOD 
it poses a very fascinating puzzle for us .PERIOD 
in particular check out asia .PERIOD 
zoom in on haiti ,COMMA in outline here .PERIOD 
but deng xiaoping instinctively understood the importance of offering choices to his people .PERIOD 
demonstrated successes there led to a consensus for a move toward the market model for the entire economy .PERIOD 
we can go do it over and over again .PERIOD 
we also need the choices for people .PERIOD 
the final thing we need are choices for leaders .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA when i say that ,COMMA some of you are starting to think ,COMMA well ,COMMA is this just bringing back colonialism ?QUESTIONMARK 
let us have a hong kong nearby .PERIOD 
some of my citizens will move into that city as well .PERIOD 
many of them totally get the notion of a special zone that people can opt into as a rule .PERIOD 
so let me show you why that's wrong .PERIOD 
take this representation of all of the land .PERIOD 
their kids can get an education .PERIOD 
so what will it take to get started building the first charter cities ,COMMA scaling this so we build many more ?QUESTIONMARK 
let's have a system where we have ownership of land that is registered in a government office ,COMMA that people can pledge as collateral .PERIOD

i'm sure that resonates with some of the tedsters .PERIOD 
told me don't eat that marshmallow ,COMMA because if you wait you're going to get two of them ,COMMA until i learned to balance out .PERIOD 
and of all the places in the solar system that we might go to and search for answers to questions like this ,COMMA there's saturn .PERIOD and we have been to saturn before - we visited saturn in the early <NUM> - but our investigations of saturn have become far more in-depth in detail since the cassini spacecraft ,COMMA traveling across interplanetary space for seven years ,COMMA glided into orbit around saturn in the summer of <NUM> ,COMMA and became at that point the farthest robotic outpost that humanity had ever established around the sun .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA just studying the rings alone ,COMMA we stand to learn a lot about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies .PERIOD

try to imagine what the surface of titan might look like .PERIOD 
it's cold ,COMMA it's eerie ,COMMA it's misty ,COMMA it might be raining ,COMMA and you might be standing on the shores of lake michigan brimming with paint thinner .PERIOD 
as i said ,COMMA it has a thick ,COMMA extensive atmosphere .PERIOD 
we have instruments on cassini which can see down to the surface through this atmosphere ,COMMA and my camera system is one of them .PERIOD 
they look like they've been pulled apart .PERIOD 
so it was - i mean ,COMMA i'm getting goose bumps just talking about it .PERIOD 
but this is somewhat of a shoreline .PERIOD 
and obviously ,COMMA it landed in one of these flat ,COMMA dark regions and it didn't sink out of sight .PERIOD so it wasn't fluid that we landed in .PERIOD 
and it's probably the case that this material has washed off the highlands of titan through these channels that we saw ,COMMA and has drained over billions of years to fill in low-lying basins .PERIOD 
and i think you would agree that we have found titan is a remarkable ,COMMA mystical place .PERIOD it's exotic ,COMMA it's alien ,COMMA but yet strangely earth-like ,COMMA and having earth-like geological formations and a tremendous geographical diversity ,COMMA and is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system for complexity and richness is the earth itself .PERIOD 
it is a very geologically active body .PERIOD 
or this ?QUESTIONMARK 
really ?QUESTIONMARK 
we're having trouble feeding six billion today .PERIOD

a week later ,COMMA they held the most well-attended and disciplined demonstration to date .PERIOD 
so the human brain has about a hundred billion neurons in it .PERIOD 
so beyond spatial memory ,COMMA if we look for this grid-like firing pattern throughout the whole brain ,COMMA we see it in a whole series of locations which are always active when we do all kinds of autobiographical memory tasks ,COMMA like remembering the last time you went to a wedding ,COMMA for example .PERIOD 
or better ,COMMA how do you explain when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions ?QUESTIONMARK 
why ?QUESTIONMARK how ?QUESTIONMARK what ?QUESTIONMARK 
we say what we do ,COMMA we say how we're different or how we're better and we expect some sort of a behavior ,COMMA a purchase ,COMMA a vote ,COMMA something like that .PERIOD
