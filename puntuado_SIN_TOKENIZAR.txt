.PERIOD now ,COMMA a dolphin mother dolphin any dolphin -- .PERIOD there's only one way that a pcb can get out of a dolphin .PERIOD and what's that ?QUESTIONMARK here's a diagram of the pcb load of dolphins in sarasota bay .PERIOD and we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places .PERIOD that's a tragedy for those populations .PERIOD but it's also a tragedy for the people eating them ,COMMA because they don't know that that's toxic meat .PERIOD these same infections ,COMMA create harmful algal blooms .PERIOD i started out showing how much we had distressed the monterey bay ecosystem with pollution ,COMMA and the canning industry ,COMMA and all of the attendant problems .PERIOD it's an ocean planet .PERIOD and we think of ourselves as a terrestrial species ,COMMA but the pyramid of life in the ocean and our own lives on land are intricately connected .PERIOD it's a huge driver for culture .PERIOD and i think that it's the most underrated force on our behavior .PERIOD the people in these studies report feeling so awake during the daytime that they realize they're experiencing true wakefulness for the first time in their lives .PERIOD so cut to the modern day .PERIOD okay ,COMMA we'll do something with it .PERIOD puppets always have to try to be alive .PERIOD it's their kind of ur-story onstage that desperation to live .PERIOD his mother was a puppeteer .PERIOD and in fact ,COMMA it took about 10 years to discover the bambara bamana puppets of mali in west africa ,COMMA where there's a fabulous tradition of puppetry to learn a renewed ,COMMA or a new respect for this art form .PERIOD so we made a model ,COMMA and we had a crate built for it .PERIOD we were going to test-drive it on the street outside of our house in cape town ,COMMA and it got to midnight .PERIOD and we hadn't done that .PERIOD yet a month later ,COMMA we were there in london with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us .PERIOD and

.PERIOD he might get irritated .PERIOD the ears are obviously a very important emotional indicator of the horse .PERIOD when they point right back .PERIOD the horse is fearful or angry ,COMMA depending upon what's going on in front of him around him .PERIOD the hind legs have got the same action .PERIOD and mikey also has in his fingers ,COMMA the ability to move the tail from left to right and up and down with the other hand .PERIOD and together ,COMMA there's quite a complex possibility of tail expression .PERIOD and it's very ,COMMA very simple ,COMMA because all that happens is that the puppeteer breathes with his knees .PERIOD but of course ,COMMA it was the cane is light .PERIOD the cane is flexible .PERIOD the cane is durable ,COMMA and the cane is moldable ,COMMA and it's driven and propelled forward by new leaders ,COMMA like many of the people here by new tools ,COMMA like the ones we've seen here and by new pressures .PERIOD what it tells is the story of how

call the social singularity .PERIOD we can create a future where hope and history rhyme .PERIOD that's why i have one last thing .PERIOD i want to show you and they were great community leaders .PERIOD i keep this photograph close by to me -- .PERIOD it's in my office -- ,COMMA because i've always felt a mystical connection to these two men .PERIOD both of whom i never knew ,COMMA and i want you to imagine that it's 100 years from now and your grandchild or great-grandchild ,COMMA or niece ,COMMA or nephew ,COMMA or god-child ,COMMA is looking at this photograph of you .PERIOD and what do i mean by that ?QUESTIONMARK and i asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most .PERIOD what we're actually going to see is that fundamentally people are communicating on a

or you use recycled materials to make goods that you can actually use and sell .PERIOD and in my hometown ,COMMA we actually tried to do one of these in the bronx .PERIOD but our mayor decided what he wanted to see was a jail on that same spot .PERIOD this can support seasonal farmers around metro areas who are losing out because they really can't meet the year-round demand for produce .PERIOD and imagine a national business model that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure to improve local economic stability .PERIOD the recession has us reeling and fearful .PERIOD and there's something in

:COLON i'm just british rb .PERIOD oh ,COMMA okay .PERIOD he's pretty good .PERIOD yeah ,COMMA good .PERIOD good ,COMMA good .PERIOD and at different places in that space ,COMMA it expresses -- .PERIOD can we have the volume on here ?QUESTIONMARK kismet :COLON do you really think ?QUESTIONMARK so ,COMMA do you really think so voice :COLON look at my smile .PERIOD voice :COLON no ,COMMA no ,COMMA you're not to do that .PERIOD no ,COMMA we don't know whether he understood or not that the robot -- .PERIOD notice ,COMMA the turn-taking after all ,COMMA that's certainly what modern molecular biology says about us .PERIOD and for those of you that have teenagers ,COMMA you know what that's like .PERIOD and i don't think -- -- .PERIOD i don't think we're going to deliberately build robots that we're uncomfortable with .PERIOD and the watchmaker turned around and said ,COMMA god can see it ,COMMA but i felt something now you probably know the answer to this already .PERIOD i remember it clearly ,COMMA i thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA what the hell's that about ?QUESTIONMARK now i'm not a neuroscientist ,COMMA and how much of that ?QUESTIONMARK reactive side of it is due to what we already know or what we're going to learn about something .PERIOD and as we assemble these tools from a design point of view ,COMMA i get terribly excited about it ,COMMA because these are things as we've already said ,COMMA they're arriving at the brain .PERIOD it would seem before cognition before we can manipulate them -- electrochemical party tricks .PERIOD now ,COMMA when talking

anais nin .PERIOD and the talmud have told us time and time again ,COMMA that we see things not as they are .PERIOD but as we are ahhhh ,COMMA but i also know why it's exquisite to me ,COMMA because it's a palimpsest of things .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA if i just go through some of them now -- ,COMMA i know about laminar flow when it comes to air-piercing objects .PERIOD and that does it consummately ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA you can see it can why would you do that ?QUESTIONMARK beautiful ?QUESTIONMARK maybe lesser underneath this ,COMMA like the story of the swan is a million things very difficult to do .PERIOD so ,COMMA all hail to that ,COMMA the knowledge bubble that sits around the outside ,COMMA the stuff that costs nothing because that knowledge is free -- bundle that together .PERIOD and where do we come out ?QUESTIONMARK and so i've stopped using words like form ,COMMA and i've stopped using words like function as a designer ,COMMA and for the last decade ,COMMA or so ,COMMA it's been quite clear .PERIOD what being an atheist means ?QUESTIONMARK now ,COMMA i think it's too easy .PERIOD and what i'd like to inaugurate today is a new way of being an atheist -- .PERIOD if you like a new version of atheism ,COMMA we could call atheism 20 .PERIOD i really like the art of mantegna .PERIOD i think there is an alternative .PERIOD we have secularized badly .PERIOD i would argue ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the kind of thing a commencement address is and graduation ceremonies ,COMMA those lyrical claims that education .PERIOD the process of education ,COMMA -- ,COMMA particularly higher education ,COMMA -- will make us into nobler and better human beings .PERIOD we need data .PERIOD we don't need help .PERIOD and so we need guidance ,COMMA and we need didactic learning .PERIOD they'd go ,COMMA no ,COMMA no .PERIOD i don't need one of those .PERIOD well ,COMMA a sermon wants to change your life .PERIOD and a lecture wants to give you a bit of information ,COMMA otherwise our minds are like sieves .PERIOD we associate repetition with boredom .PERIOD we're just going to run through all the old ones and watch them five times because they're so true .PERIOD the other things that religions do is to arrange time all the major religions give us calendars .PERIOD you won't do that by accident .PERIOD you will do that ,COMMA because you are guided to do that in the secular world .PERIOD we think ,COMMA if an idea is important ,COMMA i'll bump into it .PERIOD that's very good in the secular world .PERIOD you can come through the university system and be a lousy speaker ,COMMA and still have a great career ,COMMA what you're saying needs to be backed up by a really convincing way of saying it .PERIOD after every convincing point people will go amen ,COMMA amen ,COMMA amen at the end of a really rousing paragraph .PERIOD they'll all stand up and they'll go .PERIOD thank you jesus .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD christ :COLON thank you .PERIOD savior .PERIOD religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two .PERIOD we sometimes hear it said that museums are our new cathedrals or our new churches .PERIOD art is about two things in all the major faiths .PERIOD and if that thing is good ,COMMA there's no problem with it at all art should be didactic ,COMMA whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff ,COMMA -- the therapists ,COMMA the poets -- are on their own .PERIOD and they have no power .PERIOD they have no might .PERIOD but you left out one aspect of religion that a lot of people might say your agenda could borrow from ,COMMA which is this sense -- .PERIOD that's actually probably the most important thing to anyone who's religious -- of spiritual experience of some kind of connection with something that's bigger than you are ,COMMA is there any room for that experience in atheism 20 ?QUESTIONMARK i would say that there are many many gaps in secular life ,COMMA and these can be plugged .PERIOD and as it happened ,COMMA i read it from midnight to five in the morning in one shot .PERIOD this is one of the largest underground labs in the world .PERIOD there is another way to search for dark matter ,COMMA which is indirectly ,COMMA when a neutrino hits a water molecule ,COMMA it emits a kind of blue light ,COMMA a flash of blue light .PERIOD and by looking for this blue light ,COMMA you can essentially understand something about the neutrino .PERIOD and then ,COMMA indirectly ,COMMA something about the dark matter that might have created this neutrino .PERIOD but nonetheless ,COMMA it's an extraordinary piece of engineering .PERIOD here's another view of the same .PERIOD the reason why you have to build these telescopes in places like the atacama desert is because of the high altitude desert .PERIOD and remember all this wiring is being done by people in extreme cold in sub-zero temperatures .PERIOD they're wearing about 15 kg of clothing and stuff ,COMMA but they have to take their gloves off in order to do that anil ananthaswamy .PERIOD and i'll finally like to leave you with two images ,COMMA they're going to learn from whatever it is .PERIOD they have around them .PERIOD it is by far and away the largest print library in the world .PERIOD then the question is ,COMMA what do you get ?QUESTIONMARK it's starting to be a little bit more specified .PERIOD but i have to say that there's older technologies that i tend to like .PERIOD and it turns out to not be very hard .PERIOD you can actually get really good-looking books for on the order of one penny per page sort of the parts cost for doing this .PERIOD and so we've tried that ,COMMA and i'll go over that in a moment ,COMMA and it's called the espresso book machine .PERIOD and in about 10 minutes ,COMMA you can press a button and make a book .PERIOD and one of my favorites in this is the $100 laptop .PERIOD if you really care about books ,COMMA you're going to scan them better ,COMMA especially if they're valuable books .PERIOD so all in all ,COMMA that's going very well .PERIOD and so we're starting up a program to do out-of-print works ,COMMA but loaning them ,COMMA but it is within our grasp technologically and law-wise ,COMMA at least for the out of print and out of copyright .PERIOD we suggest to be able to get the whole darn thing online .PERIOD it's sort of the biggest tivo box you've ever seen .PERIOD it's about a petabyte so far of worldwide television -- ,COMMA russian chinese japanese iraqi al jazeera ,COMMA bbc cnn abc cbs ,COMMA nbc -- 24 hours a day .PERIOD so we've got about 100000 pieces up there .PERIOD and actually ,COMMA it's really been pioneered by alexa internet ,COMMA which donates this collection to the internet archive .PERIOD if we go and put it in a couple more places ,COMMA i think we'll be in good shape .PERIOD you'll eat countless gourmet meals not likely and this .PERIOD and then this day 21 day 23 day 25 ,COMMA fungi don't like to rot from bacteria .PERIOD and so our best antibiotics come from fungi .PERIOD how is that possible ?QUESTIONMARK the tallest plants on earth ,COMMA at that time were less than two feet .PERIOD the earth was struck by an asteroid ,COMMA a huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere .PERIOD we were involved with several experiments .PERIOD there were four piles saturated with diesel and other petroleum waste .PERIOD one was a control pile .PERIOD one pile was treated with enzymes .PERIOD one pile was treated with bacteria and our pile we inoculated with mushroom mycelium .PERIOD the mycelium is producing enzymes ,COMMA -- peroxidases -- that break carbon-hydrogen bonds .PERIOD so i invented burlap sacks bunker ,COMMA spawn -- and putting the mycelium -- using storm blown debris .PERIOD you can take these burlap sacks and put them downstream from a farm that's producing e :COLON coli or other wastes ,COMMA or a factory with chemical toxins .PERIOD and it leads to habitat restoration .PERIOD there's more than a 100 million colonies per gram and 10 to the third power is around 1000 in 48 hours to 72 hours .PERIOD these three mushroom species reduced the amount of coliform bacteria 10000 times .PERIOD this is a space-conservative method that uses storm debris -- .PERIOD and we can guarantee that we will have storms every year .PERIOD so this one mushroom in particular has drawn our interest over time .PERIOD and a few years ago we received these results .PERIOD 10 or greater are considered to be very active .PERIOD and so for the first time ,COMMA i am showing this ,COMMA and we're using a natural extract within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical .PERIOD so i went to the epa homepage ,COMMA and they were recommending studies with metarhizium species of a group of fungi that kill carpenter ants as well as termites .PERIOD the life box -- .PERIOD you're gonna be getting a dvd of the ted conference -- .PERIOD you add soil ,COMMA you add water ,COMMA you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores like of the agarikon mushroom ,COMMA the seeds then are mothered by this mycelium .PERIOD i've also lived in biosphere 2 well ,COMMA in 1991 ,COMMA it was finally time for us to go in and try out this baby the day i walked into biosphere 2 .PERIOD i was for the first time ,COMMA breathing a completely different atmosphere than everybody else in the world ,COMMA except seven other people .PERIOD we were taking their biomass storing them in the basement growing plants ,COMMA going around around around trying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere .PERIOD and we had no clue where it was and that you literally do that you stop breathing .PERIOD and then you -- -- ,COMMA take a breath ,COMMA and it wakes you up ,COMMA and it's very irritating ,COMMA and i recoiled ,COMMA they stank people stink .PERIOD i had no idea what was in my food where it came from .PERIOD and so we sent one onto the mir space station .PERIOD shrimp farms are a scourge on the earth ,COMMA frankly ,COMMA from an environmental point of view and understand its interactions with the entire earth .PERIOD now it may not seem like it ,COMMA but we are .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD what i'd like you to do is just really quickly is just sort of nod to the person on your right and then nod to the person on your left and one documentary writer ,COMMA who was here and looked at this .PERIOD two months after i was here described this ,COMMA not as beehives ,COMMA but as a graveyard with these empty white boxes with no bees left in them .PERIOD it was called that ,COMMA because a guy in israel ,COMMA first found it .PERIOD and he now regrets profoundly calling it that disease .PERIOD because of course ,COMMA there's the implication we needed beeswax for a project we were working on .PERIOD he was so capable .PERIOD he was able to render the nicest block of beeswax .PERIOD i have ever seen from cow dung tin cans and his veil ,COMMA which he used as a screening right in this meadow .PERIOD and so that ingenuity is inspiring .PERIOD and we see these families these nomadic families ,COMMA you know ,COMMA father to son ,COMMA father to son .PERIOD and these guys are hurting .PERIOD we have bumblebees on the top .PERIOD dennis vanengelsdorp bee ,COMMA okay ,COMMA thanks .PERIOD and in fact ,COMMA there is now a red list of pollinators that we're worried have disappeared .PERIOD and on top of that list are a lot of these kleptoparasites .PERIOD but also these bumblebees .PERIOD there are other animals that pollinate like bats .PERIOD and bats are in trouble too .PERIOD but i'm glad to say that i think we know the cause of all these conditions ,COMMA and that cause is ndd nature deficit disorder .PERIOD and that is make meadows and not lawns .PERIOD now ,COMMA not all of us have meadows or lawns that we can convert .PERIOD and so you can always ,COMMA of course ,COMMA grow a meadow in a pot ,COMMA and everyone should open a beehive ,COMMA because it is the most amazing incredible thing .PERIOD and if we want to cure ourselves of ndd or nature deficit disorder ,COMMA i think this is a great way of doing it .PERIOD she googled ,COMMA and she found this world whistling championship in america .PERIOD of course .PERIOD okay ,COMMA i'm not the only one whistling here .PERIOD and i want to first rehearse with you your whistling .PERIOD i start it myself ,COMMA but there is a much more fundamental mistake in the overall story of the ark .PERIOD that's not reported here .PERIOD so now we have god that is going to submerge earth permanently ,COMMA or at least for a very long period .PERIOD and no one is taking care of plants .PERIOD why ?QUESTIONMARK this is not the common man .PERIOD you know ,COMMA very well about professors ,COMMA when he speaks about animals ,COMMA [he] tends to remove the fact that plants exist ,COMMA the blue whale ,COMMA the biggest creature that exists on the planet -- that is wrong completely wrong .PERIOD some of them are much more sophisticated .PERIOD many insects have been used by plants as vectors for the transport of the pollination ,COMMA but not just insects ,COMMA even birds reptiles .PERIOD and mammals ,COMMA like bats rats are normally used for the transportation of the pollen .PERIOD this is a serious business .PERIOD so we studied the root apex ,COMMA and we found that there is a specific region that is here depicted in blue -- that is called the transition zone .PERIOD now ,COMMA we know that a root apex has just a few hundred cells that show this kind of feature .PERIOD but we know how big the root apparatus of a small plant like a plant of rye .PERIOD they work in the same way .PERIOD well ,COMMA if you want to fly ,COMMA it's good that you look at birds -- to be inspired by birds .PERIOD but if you want to explore soils ,COMMA or if you want to colonize new territory to best thing that you can do is to be inspired by plants that are masters in doing this .PERIOD it's much more easy to work with plants than with animals .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD she's being filmed with a hidden camera .PERIOD so she's noticed the unusual thing ,COMMA but she's gone back to her normal life .PERIOD and we've continued to do it every year looking at the entire facade .PERIOD -- .PERIOD there were 70 total windows -- .PERIOD and i knew what i had to do .PERIOD so then i gave a new hand signal ,COMMA which signaled the next soloist down below in forever ,COMMA 21 and he danced .PERIOD this is the best buy in new york city ,COMMA and it's a very depressing place to be in the morning .PERIOD it's very crowded .PERIOD the participants at improv everywhere events have just as much leisure time as any other new yorkers .PERIOD they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way .PERIOD and i think that's sort of the point of improv everywhere .PERIOD there was no way to predict how far it would spread through water supplies and how bad the situation would get .PERIOD it doesn't require any special training .PERIOD it's a quite wonderfully designed animal .PERIOD they have become domesticated .PERIOD and human beings have been redesigning their religions for thousands of years ,COMMA because what i've been doing for the last four years ,COMMA really ,COMMA since the first time ,COMMA you saw me -- .PERIOD some of you saw me at ted when i was talking about religion .PERIOD and in the last four years ,COMMA i've been working just about non-stop on this topic .PERIOD and you might say ,COMMA it's about the reverse engineering of religions .PERIOD and as with the cow ,COMMA there's a mixture of evolutionary design designed by natural selection itself and intelligent design -- more or less intelligent design -- and redesigned by human beings who are trying to redesign their religions .PERIOD it's like a coin flip .PERIOD it doesn't count really ,COMMA is it totalitarian to require reading writing and arithmetic ?QUESTIONMARK i know many religions are so anxious about preserving the purity of their faith among their children that they are intent on keeping their children ignorant of other faiths .PERIOD this picture which i pulled off the web -- .PERIOD the fellow on the left is really an important part of this picture .PERIOD it wasn't the cleverness of the sheep at all ,COMMA if you understand orgel's second rule ,COMMA then you understand why the intelligent design movement is basically a hoax again .PERIOD and again ,COMMA biologists are fascinated with the brilliance of what's discovered ,COMMA but the process itself is without purpose without foresight without design .PERIOD well ,COMMA it's because its brain had been infected with a lancet fluke that was -- needed to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow in order to reproduce the key to our domination of the planet is culture .PERIOD and the key to culture is religion ,COMMA they'd want to know how it originated what it was for and how it perpetuates itself .PERIOD in that case ,COMMA a parasite gets into a mouse ,COMMA and it needs to get into the belly of a cat .PERIOD but i'm not just talking about islam .PERIOD i'm talking also about christianity .PERIOD you've all got a copy .PERIOD you've just heard the man .PERIOD first of all ,COMMA the goal ,COMMA the book is clear vivid accessible ,COMMA beautifully ,COMMA formatted ,COMMA just enough repetition .PERIOD and it would just be insincere of me ,COMMA not to address those problems that's worth mentioning .PERIOD you could stop reading this book ,COMMA because life would have no purpose or meaning or significance .PERIOD but that is just a difference of opinion .PERIOD that's not what i'm really worried about .PERIOD and here ,COMMA i think ,COMMA wait a minute is he endorsing creationism .PERIOD here your mind can handle 15000 decisions a second ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA there's a sense which i agree with him ,COMMA except i think it has an evolutionary explanation whose truth are we going to listen to .PERIOD and here's one that does concern me .PERIOD and i'd really like to get a response .PERIOD if rick is able to do it a very clever little meme ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating .PERIOD every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies .PERIOD it looks a bit like this .PERIOD the trouble with widespread headphone use is it brings three really big health issues .PERIOD it makes you tired and irritable to have to make up all of that data .PERIOD you're having to imagine it professional hearing protectors are great .PERIOD i use some all the time .PERIOD the elizabethans described language as decorated .PERIOD silence sound design is the future .PERIOD and i think it's the way we're going to change the way the world sounds .PERIOD it's a fantastic antidote to schizophonia to make music and sound in a group of people ,COMMA whichever style you enjoy ,COMMA particularly ,COMMA i'm leaving you with a little more birdsong ,COMMA which is very good for you .PERIOD we might one day .PERIOD see a shadow ,COMMA a black hole can cast on a very bright background ,COMMA but we haven't yet einstein realized that if space were empty ,COMMA if the universe were empty ,COMMA it would be like this picture ,COMMA except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it .PERIOD this is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions .PERIOD he thought nature would protect us from their formation .PERIOD it's actually not massive enough .PERIOD it would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there ,COMMA because we couldn't anymore than light can escape space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe want to get away from the sound .PERIOD now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging -- that it chirps up at the end .PERIOD there are very industrious experiments being built on earth -- one called ligo -- ,COMMA which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over four kilometers .PERIOD it's everywhere it's all around you .PERIOD and the space is wobbling chaotically .PERIOD imagine a billion years ago ,COMMA two black holes collided .PERIOD if it was the big bang ,COMMA we were going to pick up .PERIOD it would sound like this .PERIOD and if we pick it up ,COMMA it will be music to our ears ,COMMA because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation of our observable universe .PERIOD and our prison system itself is stuck funds for education for training .PERIOD and for rehabilitation are declining .PERIOD so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues ,COMMA we give science lectures .PERIOD and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures .PERIOD instead of watching television or weightlifting ,COMMA we partnered with the nature conservancy for inmates at stafford creek ,COMMA correctional center to grow endangered prairie plants for restoration of relic prairie areas in washington state .PERIOD and just recently ,COMMA we've begun to work with those men who are segregated in what we call supermax facilities .PERIOD and so what we see ,COMMA i think ,COMMA is that small collective movements of change can perhaps move an entity ,COMMA such as our own prison system in a direction of hope .PERIOD it can't afford to doubt .PERIOD the person who tends the child that implies a lot of trust as the child grows .PERIOD it begins to discover that the person trusted is violating the trust .PERIOD you can be compassionate .PERIOD occasionally ,COMMA more moved by empathy than by compassion .PERIOD the tennis etiquette is both the players have to come to the net and shake hands .PERIOD compassion is not defined in one form .PERIOD that means the whole universe known things and unknown things .PERIOD there's no choice in this .PERIOD that only confirms the reality that the wholeness cannot be different from .PERIOD you cannot be minus you ,COMMA you express yourself because you have compassion .PERIOD there is no shortcut .PERIOD it is like swimming by swimming .PERIOD that's interesting to me .PERIOD you fake it and make it if you know how to pray pray .PERIOD well ,COMMA it has its pluses and minuses .PERIOD therefore ,COMMA we don't find the moral emotional psychological and political space to distance ourselves from the reality of social responsibility ,COMMA oddly enough ,COMMA an artist ,COMMA such as myself finds herself .PERIOD also in the position of being the voice ,COMMA the speaker of my people ,COMMA even if i have indeed ,COMMA no access to my own country .PERIOD we are there to take pride and insist on respect .PERIOD i envy ,COMMA sometimes the artists of the west for their freedom of expression .PERIOD our people depend on our artists and culture is beyond communication .PERIOD i work in morocco in turkey in mexico ,COMMA how to tell a political story ,COMMA but an allegorical story .PERIOD what was most significant for me was once again ,COMMA the presence of the women start differentiating into effector and memory cells .PERIOD we have a million students a month using the site ,COMMA watching on the order of 100 to 200000 videos a day ,COMMA and then in a response to that same comment -- .PERIOD this is on the thread .PERIOD but the paradigm here is we'll generate as many questions as you need until you get that concept until you get 10 in a row in a traditional classroom .PERIOD you have a couple of homework .PERIOD homework lecture homework lecture ,COMMA and then you have a snapshot exam ,COMMA but as ridiculous as that sounds that's exactly what's happening in our classrooms right now .PERIOD so you can imagine -- .PERIOD and this is what we are working on -- is from this knowledge map .PERIOD you have logic ,COMMA you have computer programming ,COMMA you have grammar ,COMMA you have genetics all based off of that core of if you know this and that .PERIOD now you're ready for this next concept .PERIOD it'll change what happens at the dinner table .PERIOD green means the student's already proficient ,COMMA and the data gets pretty granular .PERIOD so you can see the exact problems that the student got right or wrong .PERIOD and so the same kids that you thought were slow .PERIOD six weeks ago ,COMMA you now would think are gifted .PERIOD and i think what you'll see emerging is this notion of a global one-world classroom .PERIOD i'm still doing all the videos ,COMMA but we have a rockstar team doing the software ,COMMA and they're doing it at the district level .PERIOD and they're literally saying ,COMMA hey ,COMMA this is nice .PERIOD but like that focus graph ,COMMA a lot of the teachers said ,COMMA i have a feeling that a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic .PERIOD but yeah ,COMMA it's all there and seeing with the brain is often called imagination .PERIOD so i am going to be talking about hallucinations and a particular sort of visual hallucination ,COMMA which i see among my patients animals too .PERIOD i see cats and dogs walking towards me .PERIOD she said ,COMMA it's got color .PERIOD it's got motion .PERIOD i said ,COMMA there is a special form of visual hallucination ,COMMA which may go with deteriorating vision or blindness .PERIOD and you have charles bonnet syndrome ,COMMA and about 10 percent of the visually impaired .PERIOD people get visual hallucinations .PERIOD now ,COMMA with the original description ,COMMA in the 18th century ,COMMA charles bonnet did not have them .PERIOD on one occasion ,COMMA he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking ,COMMA a pipe and realized .PERIOD it was himself these cartoons would be transparent and would cover half the visual field like a screen .PERIOD but what did disturb her was she got very persistent images or hallucinations of faces .PERIOD and as with rosalie ,COMMA the faces were often deformed with very large teeth ,COMMA or very large eyes .PERIOD in particular ,COMMA the notion is that if you see things or hear things ,COMMA you're going mad .PERIOD but the psychotic hallucinations are quite different .PERIOD and in particular ,COMMA one area of the temporal lobe is called the fusiform gyrus .PERIOD and now we know that there are hundreds of other sorts of cells ,COMMA which can be very ,COMMA very specific .PERIOD well ,COMMA i've more or less said what i wanted ,COMMA but they stop there .PERIOD well ,COMMA they don't disturb me any more than my tinnitus ,COMMA which i ignore .PERIOD they occasionally interest me ,COMMA and i have many pictures of them in my notebooks .PERIOD so it's a little-appreciated fact that most of the animals in our ocean make light .PERIOD i've spent most of my career studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence .PERIOD i also use it as a tool for visualizing and tracking pollution .PERIOD this is the first time it has ever been recorded .PERIOD so that light was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate ,COMMA a single-celled alga .PERIOD there's a lot of animals that use this trick .PERIOD for example ,COMMA this black dragonfish .PERIOD it's got a light organ under its eye .PERIOD it's a scream for help .PERIOD it's meant to attract attention .PERIOD there's other ways you can defend yourself with light .PERIOD this little squid is called the fire shooter because of its ability to do this .PERIOD this is a golden coral ,COMMA a bush .PERIOD we're talking to something ,COMMA but he's persistent .PERIOD we need more eyes .PERIOD on the process .PERIOD scientists have always created pictures as part of their thinking and discovery process in the top left-hand corner ,COMMA you've got this yellow-green area .PERIOD and those red molecules are hemoglobin and hemoglobin acts as a molecular sponge to soak up the oxygen in your lungs ,COMMA and then carry it to other parts of the body .PERIOD and that's how i really began .PERIOD so let's begin .PERIOD those are the letters of genetic code ,COMMA the 25000 genes .PERIOD you've got written in your dna ,COMMA but they physically run in opposite directions ,COMMA which creates a number of complications for your living cells as you're about to see most ,COMMA particularly when dna is being copied .PERIOD and so what i'm about to show you is an accurate representation of the actual dna replication machine that's occurring right now inside your body ,COMMA at least 2002 biology ,COMMA and it's jiggling and wiggling there ,COMMA because of the surrounding soup of molecules which i've stripped away .PERIOD so you can see something ,COMMA but in each one of your cells ,COMMA each strand of dna is about 30 to 40 million nanometers long .PERIOD it is made up of about 200 different types of proteins ,COMMA thousands of proteins in total .PERIOD that is the signal broadcasting system ,COMMA sending out the stop signal .PERIOD this is how you work at the molecular scale .PERIOD and we don't know exactly how they did this ,COMMA although they must have solved some collective action problems .PERIOD it only makes sense that you can't hunt mastodons while you're fighting with the other groups .PERIOD so that raised a social question that i believe must have driven new social forms again .PERIOD we can't know .PERIOD but we can be pretty sure that some form of symbolic communication must have been involved .PERIOD we saw scientific revolutions ,COMMA the protestant ,COMMA reformation ,COMMA constitutional democracies possible ,COMMA where they had not been possible before .PERIOD i'm going to talk briefly about two of them the prisoner's dilemma .PERIOD and the tragedy of the commons ,COMMA garrett hardin used it to talk about overpopulation in the late 1960s .PERIOD and most recently neurophysiological measures have shown that people who punish cheaters in economic games show activity in the reward centers of their brain .PERIOD jim surowiecki briefly mentioned yochai benkler's paper about open source pointing to a new form of production .PERIOD peer-to-peer production toyota instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace ,COMMA treats them as a network and trains them to produce better ,COMMA even though they are also training them to produce better for their competitors .PERIOD i don't think we've even begun to discover what the basic principles are .PERIOD but i think we can begin to think about them .PERIOD i believe that the payoff would be very big .PERIOD what forms of suffering could be alleviated ?QUESTIONMARK what forms of wealth could be created if we knew a little bit more about cooperation ?QUESTIONMARK i don't think that this transdisciplinary discourse is automatically going to happen .PERIOD it's going to require effort .PERIOD i'm not going to dive into them either ,COMMA but photosynths are integrated into the map .PERIOD so this is something that we're now going to try for the first time live .PERIOD and this is really truly ,COMMA very frightening .PERIOD no ,COMMA no ,COMMA the other way .PERIOD this is the current -- .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD -- .PERIOD this is the current time if we scrub the time ,COMMA then we can see how the sky will look at different times .PERIOD and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times .PERIOD different dates :COLON let's move the moon ,COMMA a little higher in the sky ,COMMA maybe change the date .PERIOD all right now .PERIOD i've overrun my time .PERIOD so i've got to stop sophal ear .PERIOD so notwithstanding ,COMMA the 1970s .PERIOD narration :COLON on april 17th 1975 .PERIOD we lived in phnom penh .PERIOD they were young soldiers ,COMMA typically child soldiers .PERIOD so the khmer rouge took us from a place called pursat to kaoh tiev ,COMMA which is across from the border from vietnam .PERIOD and we end up in hong ngu on the vietnamese side ,COMMA and then onwards to chau doc .PERIOD thank you mother .PERIOD somebody has to be a witness to what has happened to you and one evening .PERIOD i was sitting next to a very nice gentleman in kabul .PERIOD and he asked what i thought would be good in afghanistan .PERIOD this was our sign -- .PERIOD it's hand-painted .PERIOD and we had 45 all over kabul .PERIOD we developed a culturally-sensitive psycho-social counseling approach .PERIOD and now you are helping me to regain some confidence in the future .PERIOD child .PERIOD there is no difference here between classes nor white or black ,COMMA nor if you have money or not simply ,COMMA if you are talented ,COMMA if you have the vocation and the will to be here ,COMMA you get in you share with us and make music in its essence ,COMMA the orchestra .PERIOD and the choir are much more than artistic structures .PERIOD that's how they build a spirit of solidarity and fraternity among them ,COMMA develop their self-esteem and foster the ethical and aesthetical values related to the music in all its senses .PERIOD all this makes up a constructive and ascending social dynamic .PERIOD it's what makes a little girl play .PERIOD the clarinet at home .PERIOD while her mother does the housework ,COMMA and these will be some simple design qualities .PERIOD and they will also be some qualities of if you will the intelligence of interaction .PERIOD now ,COMMA we've put people 18 inches in front of a tv ,COMMA and all the artifacts that none of the original designers expected to be seen .PERIOD all of a sudden are staring you in the face .PERIOD the shadow mask ,COMMA the scan lines all of that .PERIOD and my favorite example is always fingers .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA they're not .PERIOD it's really a very ,COMMA very high-resolution input ,COMMA medium -- .PERIOD you have to just do it twice .PERIOD you have to touch the screen and then rotate your finger slightly -- .PERIOD and you can move a cursor with great accuracy ,COMMA and we have never known how to do this technically .PERIOD so this slide is a fake slide .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK so there is the pressure-sensitive display in operation ,COMMA the person's just if you will pushing on the screen to make a curve ,COMMA and what you can do -- .PERIOD oops ,COMMA i didn't mean to do that -- .PERIOD what you can do is actually feed back to the user ,COMMA the feeling of the physical properties .PERIOD what i'll show you very quickly is a new kind of book where it is mixed now ,COMMA with all sorts of things live in there ,COMMA but you have to keep a few things in mind .PERIOD so it knows ,COMMA or at least there is computer-readable information in the medium itself .PERIOD it's just not a static movie frame .PERIOD now that would be if you will the top green track ,COMMA which doesn't mean too much ,COMMA but you might have to elaborate for me ,COMMA or for somebody who isn't an expert and say ,COMMA cook at 380 degrees for 45 minutes ,COMMA if you're in a classroom situation .PERIOD and somebody asks a question ,COMMA the last thing you do is repeat what you just said .PERIOD he says ,COMMA well ,COMMA reading is this junk .PERIOD they give me in little books to read ,COMMA and that story has many other anecdotes that are similar .PERIOD but wow ,COMMA the key to the future of computers in education is right there .PERIOD and it is ,COMMA when does it mean something to a child ?QUESTIONMARK what the truth is is that speaking has great value to a child .PERIOD the child can get a great deal by talking to you .PERIOD well in senegal ,COMMA we found that this was the traditional classroom 120 kids ,COMMA -- ,COMMA three per desk .PERIOD -- one teacher ,COMMA a little bit of chalk .PERIOD that's what meant something to her is doing the hair pattern .PERIOD and actually did it within two days -- an hour each day ,COMMA -- and found it was to her absolutely the most meaningful piece .PERIOD and my last example -- ,COMMA as some of my former colleagues ,COMMA whom i see in the room ,COMMA can imagine what it will be .PERIOD now that is sufficiently zany that we would obviously jump to the bait and we did .PERIOD so if i all of a sudden turn to the person to my left and start talking to that person ,COMMA then at the person to my right's site ,COMMA he'll see these two plastic heads talking to each other .PERIOD and then if that person interrupts ,COMMA then those two heads may turn ,COMMA we're testing these kinds of simple sensor-network technologies in the home .PERIOD so that any phone that a senior is already comfortable with can help them deal with their medications .PERIOD and as we monitor phone usage by seniors over a long period of time down to the tenths of a microsecond ,COMMA that recognition moment of whether they can figure out that person on the other end is a friend .PERIOD and we start talking to them immediately ,COMMA or they do a lot of what's called trouble talk where they're like ,COMMA wait ,COMMA who is this ?QUESTIONMARK oh right .PERIOD so sensors are looking at that kind of voice if they have a hip fracture ,COMMA we go with them ,COMMA and we study their entire discharge experience .PERIOD this is 50 tsunamis scheduled on the calendar .PERIOD but somehow we can't sort of marshal our government and innovative forces to sort of get out in front of it and do something about it .PERIOD we'll wait until it's more of a catastrophe and react .PERIOD as opposed to prepare for it .PERIOD this mentality of traveling to and timesharing large ,COMMA expensive ,COMMA healthcare systems actually began in 1787 .PERIOD we have to shift from this mainframe mentality of healthcare to a personal model of healthcare .PERIOD how do we collect not just biological data ,COMMA but behavioral data ?QUESTIONMARK psychological data ,COMMA relational data in and on and around the home ,COMMA they fixed her back up .PERIOD she was never going to be able to move back into the assisted living .PERIOD they put her into the nursing home unit .PERIOD i'm not bragging about how much we fund .PERIOD it's how little anyone else actually pays attention to aging and funds innovation on aging ,COMMA chronic disease management and independent living in the home .PERIOD and so that's what i've been striving for all of my life .PERIOD but instead i go out and i find things then i just pick things up .PERIOD and so at that time ,COMMA i was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues .PERIOD the appearance of them would have been different -- ,COMMA which it is in all social animals in social groups of animals ,COMMA the juveniles always look different than the adults and probably a whole bunch of trees as well .PERIOD now it wasn't dna .PERIOD she didn't find dna .PERIOD we gave samples to mary schweitzer .PERIOD and she was actually able to determine that b-rex was a female based on medullary tissue found on the inside of the bone .PERIOD and so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18-wheeler trailer and actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples .PERIOD i mean it was wonderful stuff .PERIOD so that's what i'm here to tell you about how we are going to fix a chicken .PERIOD we started out with a wolf-like creature ,COMMA and we ended up with a maltese .PERIOD and so that's what we're looking into archaeopteryx ,COMMA which is a bird .PERIOD a primitive bird .PERIOD still has that very primitive hand .PERIOD it has the three fingers .PERIOD the three digits birds have basically rudimentary tails .PERIOD but a gene turns on and resorbs ,COMMA the tail gets rid of it .PERIOD and people always say ,COMMA why do that ?QUESTIONMARK what the frigoris you doing names are important .PERIOD now frank is this clear to you ,COMMA djabran fluctus .PERIOD listen ,COMMA i'm going back to the swamp mermaid .PERIOD can you call me in a little while ?QUESTIONMARK so these are actual names of people that work there .PERIOD i did some more investigation .PERIOD there are some mapping people who do use their names .PERIOD so formulas relate number to form .PERIOD they got little babies in there floating in there .PERIOD it's a different kind ,COMMA of course ,COMMA and they've got five apples ,COMMA because that's why we're here really .PERIOD i think to figure stuff out and to love each other ,COMMA they are so different .PERIOD bode's law wasn't even his law .PERIOD it was a guy named titus ,COMMA just a correlation that indicates how things are misinterpreted golden section .PERIOD i've been obsessed with this thing since before i was born .PERIOD i know that scares a lot of you ,COMMA but that was my purpose entirely .PERIOD if fibonacci had been on paxil ,COMMA that would be the fibonacci series .PERIOD yes ,COMMA mama ,COMMA there is so many intricate relationships that i'm not going to go there now ,COMMA because you would say ,COMMA hey ,COMMA go back to the fluctus part .PERIOD and i'm presenting it here at ted .PERIOD why it just seems like it's not sexy and elegant .PERIOD it's hidden .PERIOD and look at this built within .PERIOD it is the golden ratio .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD good afternoon in 1982 ,COMMA in the middle of the cold war in soviet siberia ,COMMA a pipeline exploded with a burst of 3 kilotons ,COMMA the equivalent of a fourth of the hiroshima bomb .PERIOD and with these keys ,COMMA they may have been able to get inside centcom's systems to see and hear everything ,COMMA and maybe even infect some of them as a result .PERIOD the americans take the threat very seriously .PERIOD i'll quote general ,COMMA james cartwright ,COMMA vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff ,COMMA who says in a report to congress that cyberattacks could be as powerful as weapons of mass destruction .PERIOD moreover ,COMMA the americans have decided to spend over 30 billion dollars in the next five years to build up their cyberwar capabilities .PERIOD cyber weapons have this peculiar feature .PERIOD they can be used without leaving traces .PERIOD cartoons are basically short stories .PERIOD and that prompted people to make maps like this with all kinds of wonderful detail on the land .PERIOD but when you get to the waters edge ,COMMA the ocean looks like one ,COMMA giant puddle of blue paint .PERIOD and best of all i saw the animals .PERIOD could you image if we looked through the hubble telescope ?QUESTIONMARK and we saw that it would start a whole new space race .PERIOD for instance ,COMMA take these sea turtles .PERIOD they kind of have a sixth sense like superman's x-ray vision .PERIOD they can sense the magnetic fields of the earth or take this sea cucumber .PERIOD he's sort of a homer simpson with fins .PERIOD he goes down ,COMMA and he meets this famous anglerfish .PERIOD the third storyline i did about a year .PERIOD and a half ago was probably my most difficult .PERIOD i do three or four strips after that ,COMMA where we explore the finning issue and the shark fin soup issue .PERIOD there was a real website based in china that actually sold shark fins .PERIOD so i kind of exposed that ,COMMA and you see ,COMMA you have a beautiful piece of white alabaster .PERIOD so you say to yourself ,COMMA well ,COMMA that's worth something .PERIOD so you go back into the room ,COMMA and you break this thing to pieces ,COMMA and you haul it away .PERIOD thanks for listening .PERIOD audience :COLON 22 .PERIOD audience :COLON 47 .PERIOD woman :COLON no 594 .PERIOD let's give three of them ,COMMA a nice round of applause there .PERIOD what i'm going to try and do then -- .PERIOD i notice that took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer .PERIOD audience :COLON 23 .PERIOD audience :COLON 59 .PERIOD 95218564 .PERIOD eight-digit ,COMMA capacity .PERIOD -- .PERIOD don't you hate that in the meanwhile ,COMMA let me conclude the first part of my show by doing something a little trickier ,COMMA really scramble them up this time ,COMMA please for my next number -- ,COMMA while i mentally recharge my batteries .PERIOD i have one more question for the audience .PERIOD let's see starting with -- .PERIOD let's start with a gentleman first .PERIOD ok ,COMMA sir .PERIOD what year was it ?QUESTIONMARK first of all ,COMMA that's why i start with a gentleman ,COMMA first yell it out what year .PERIOD audience :COLON 1959 .PERIOD 1959 .PERIOD ok ,COMMA -- .PERIOD and the month .PERIOD audience :COLON may ab :COLON may what it was .PERIOD ab :COLON and it was cloudy 57683 squared ,COMMA yuck .PERIOD i'm going to break the problem down into three parts .PERIOD i'll do 57000 squared ,COMMA plus 683 squared ,COMMA plus 57000 times 683 times two while i explain something else .PERIOD -- -- .PERIOD i know that you can use right ?QUESTIONMARK that seems right .PERIOD i'll go on cookie .PERIOD fission ,COMMA ok ,COMMA a third time .PERIOD it's just being a technician .PERIOD so i'm not going to talk about that get them out of schools and keep them out of schools having said that i outlined my talk about five minutes ago .PERIOD no ,COMMA if you want to know what society's going to be like in 20 years ,COMMA ask a kindergarten teacher ,COMMA but to me things aren't the future right away .PERIOD i hope that all of your eyes glaze over .PERIOD this is a klein bottle .PERIOD it's one sided .PERIOD it's a bottle whose inside is its outside .PERIOD it has zero volume ,COMMA and it's non-orientable .PERIOD it has wonderful properties .PERIOD that was a month of my life .PERIOD oh cool .PERIOD i can get to this place over here .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK i take lunch hour .PERIOD one of the things that i've done for my science students is to tell them .PERIOD look .PERIOD i'm going to teach you college-level physics is a constant when the frequency goes up .PERIOD the wavelength comes down .PERIOD wavelength goes up frequency goes down .PERIOD so if we have a wave here -- over here ,COMMA that's what's interesting -- .PERIOD as the pitch goes up .PERIOD things get closer pitch goes down things stretch out now .PERIOD so i know the frequency .PERIOD those of you who are physicists ,COMMA i hear you rolling your eyes ,COMMA but bear with me .PERIOD it's one of these bell-tower buildings .PERIOD i keep climbing up ,COMMA go back a dome .PERIOD one of these ten-foot domes in this light may science and religion endeavor here for the steady ,COMMA evolution of mankind ,COMMA from darkness ,COMMA to light from narrowness to broad-mindedness from prejudice to tolerance .PERIOD it's time for me to let it go .PERIOD we want space efficiency .PERIOD finally ,COMMA we want multifunctional spaces and housewares -- ,COMMA a sink combined with a toilet ,COMMA a dining table becomes a bed ,COMMA -- ,COMMA same space ,COMMA a little side table ,COMMA stretches out to seat 10 guests .PERIOD move the moving wall .PERIOD have some fold-down guest beds .PERIOD thank you seriously ,COMMA but dangerously ,COMMA fun .PERIOD and there it is .PERIOD and i think this is a typical picture of what it was like in a courtyard .PERIOD then .PERIOD so i'm gonna .PERIOD take you through what i think is a remarkable sequence .PERIOD any of you who've been to africa or had a junkyard dog .PERIOD come after you ,COMMA there is a fixed kind of predatory gaze that you know you're in trouble .PERIOD and this polar bear stands over the husky ,COMMA no ,COMMA claws extended .PERIOD no fangs ,COMMA taking a look .PERIOD and it's that state that allows these two creatures to explore the possible .PERIOD they are beginning to do something that neither would have done without the play signals .PERIOD and it is a marvelous example of how a differential in power can be overridden by a process of nature .PERIOD that's within all of us .PERIOD john mentioned that i've done some work with murderers .PERIOD and i have if you're having a bad day ,COMMA try this jump up and down ,COMMA wiggle around -- .PERIOD you're going to feel better ,COMMA but it has to be safe exploration .PERIOD but if you look closely ,COMMA they're kind of like the polar bear and husky no claws .PERIOD flat fur soft eyes open mouth with no fangs balletic movements ,COMMA curvilinear movements ,COMMA -- all specific to play .PERIOD we all have an internal narrative that's our own inner story .PERIOD we don't know a whole lot about what it does for the human brain ,COMMA because funding has not been exactly heavy for research on play .PERIOD i think that -- that's a few years back -- .PERIOD i think that wave is past .PERIOD and the play wave is cresting ,COMMA because there is some good science .PERIOD now the program says that the opposite of play is not work .PERIOD it's depression .PERIOD nobody misses that dog .PERIOD i took a picture of on a carmel beach a couple of weeks ago .PERIOD you may not know this word ,COMMA but it should be your biological first name .PERIOD and last name found that when he looked at a playground out of a window into which he had been confined ,COMMA he felt something different and looking at his history ,COMMA which is common in the press .PERIOD it seems to me at least -- looking at it from a shrink's point of view ,COMMA -- that a lot of his life was programmed .PERIOD he had the expectations of his senatorial father and washington dc .PERIOD most of us work with groups .PERIOD and i put this up because the dschool ,COMMA the design school at stanford .PERIOD thanks to david kelley .PERIOD and a lot of others who have been visionary about its establishment has allowed a group of us to get together and create a course called from play to innovation .PERIOD so what will follow is a student-made film about just that ,COMMA but it doesn't have to be that way .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD if you stop a cat from playing -- ,COMMA which you can do .PERIOD and we've all seen how cats bat around stuff -- .PERIOD they're just as good predators as they would be ,COMMA if they hadn't played .PERIOD and if you look at sleep and dreams ,COMMA biologically animals sleep and dream ,COMMA and they rehearse ,COMMA and they do some other things that help memory .PERIOD and that are a very important part of sleep and dreams .PERIOD the next step of evolution ,COMMA in mammals and creatures with divinely superfluous neurons will be to play .PERIOD well ,COMMA i think the only way i know to do it is to have accumulated the advisers that i have who go from practitioners ,COMMA -- ,COMMA who can establish through improvisational play or clowning ,COMMA or whatever -- a state of play .PERIOD unfortunately ,COMMA that hasn't been done sufficiently for the national science foundation national institute of mental health ,COMMA or anybody else to really look at it in this way seriously .PERIOD so our diners started to get bored with this idea ,COMMA and we decided to give them the same course twice .PERIOD so here we actually took an element from the maki roll ,COMMA and and took a picture of a dish .PERIOD and then basically served that picture with the dish .PERIOD it's a glycoprotein called miraculin a naturally occurring thing .PERIOD it still freaks me out every time i eat it ,COMMA but it has a unique ability to mask certain taste receptors on your tongue .PERIOD so that primarily sour taste receptors .PERIOD so normally things that would taste very sour ,COMMA or tart ,COMMA somehow begin to taste very sweet as long as it's good for you and good for the environment .PERIOD it doesn't matter aside from one-person abc mini-bureaus in nairobi ,COMMA new delhi and mumbai .PERIOD there are no network news bureaus in all of africa ,COMMA india or south america ,COMMA -- places that are home to more than two billion people .PERIOD and can we afford not to ?QUESTIONMARK thank you .PERIOD at this time ,COMMA there were thousands of individuals ,COMMA we think that were infected with hiv .PERIOD ok ,COMMA now ,COMMA more importantly ,COMMA had we been there in the '40s and '50s '60s had we seen this disease had we understood exactly what was going on with it ?QUESTIONMARK how might that have changed and completely transformed the nature of the way this pandemic ?QUESTIONMARK moved ?QUESTIONMARK nevertheless ,COMMA we spend the vast majority of our energy focused on this level of the pyramid ,COMMA trying to tackle things that are already completely adapted to human beings that are going to be very ,COMMA very difficult to address -- as we've seen in the case of hiv .PERIOD so during the last 15 years ,COMMA i've been working to actually study the earlier interface here -- what i've labeled viral chatter ,COMMA which was a term coined by my mentor don burke .PERIOD narrator :COLON deep in a remote region of cameroon ,COMMA two hunters stalk their prey ,COMMA a group of hunters approach their packs loaded with wild game .PERIOD this is challenging work to do but -- .PERIOD when he began to speak ,COMMA they would actually recognize his voice from the radio .PERIOD so what happened ?QUESTIONMARK so during the 10 years that we've been doing this work ,COMMA we actually surprised ourselves .PERIOD we made a number of discoveries .PERIOD it's something we should be following .PERIOD it's not something that we should be surprised by .PERIOD so it's not just hunters in central africa .PERIOD and somehow the idea that one would want to make art for the iphone ,COMMA which my friends and i are doing now is still not reflected in our understanding of what computers are for .PERIOD if you look carefully ,COMMA you can even see a hint of the apple menu up here in the upper left where the virtual world has literally punched through to the physical .PERIOD because this is in some sense ,COMMA the first way that people discover their own potential as actors and discover their own agency ,COMMA by saying ,COMMA who is that person in the mirror ?QUESTIONMARK oh ,COMMA it's actually me song is one of our oldest ways of making ourselves heard and understood .PERIOD and so whereas dr oliver sacks has talked about how perhaps one person in a million actually has true synesthesia ,COMMA where they hear colors or taste shapes and things like this phonaesthesia is something we can all experience to some extent .PERIOD so the idea is you step into a kind of a magic light .PERIOD you know ,COMMA they don't imagine the person in the booth typing it all .PERIOD and it's one of the most interesting technical challenges that's very currently active in the computer sciences ,COMMA being able to have a camera that can understand from a fairly big distance away how these little tiny balls are actually pointing in one way or another to reveal what you're interested in and where your attention is directed .PERIOD and so i've been beginning with a variety of different projects to understand how people can relate to machines with their eyes in the first one ,COMMA which i'm going to show you called eyecode .PERIOD it's a piece of interactive software in which ,COMMA if we read this little circle ,COMMA the trace left by the looking of the previous observer ,COMMA looks at the trace left by the looking of previous observer .PERIOD but if i come up really close and stare directly at the camera on this laptop ,COMMA then you'll see these nice crisp eyes .PERIOD and what you're typing are recordings of your eyes as you're looking at other peoples' eyes .PERIOD and this exists in larger installations where there are thousands and thousands of eyes that people could be staring at .PERIOD as you see ,COMMA who's looking at the people looking at the people looking before them ,COMMA checking him out ,COMMA you say ,COMMA what you're doing in 140 characters or less and people who are interested in .PERIOD you get those updates .PERIOD it is by sharing these moments as they're happening .PERIOD that lets people feel more connected ,COMMA and in touch ,COMMA despite distance .PERIOD and in real time ,COMMA one of my favorites is what happened a few months ago when there was a gas shortage in atlanta .PERIOD it's happened more and more lately ,COMMA whether it's raising money for homeless people or to dig wells in africa ,COMMA or for a family in crisis .PERIOD evan williams :COLON nice .PERIOD thanks .PERIOD and i would like to tell you a few personal stories about what i like to call the danger of the single story .PERIOD my characters also drank a lot of ginger beer ,COMMA because the characters in the british books ,COMMA i read drank ginger beer .PERIOD i realized that people like me girls with skin ,COMMA the color of chocolate ,COMMA whose kinky hair could not form ponytails could also exist in literature .PERIOD but the unintended consequence was that i did not know that people like me could exist in literature .PERIOD so what the discovery of african writers did for me was this .PERIOD it saved me from having a single story of what books are .PERIOD so i felt enormous pity for fide's family .PERIOD if i had not grown up in nigeria .PERIOD and if all i knew about africa were from popular images ,COMMA i too would think that africa was a place of beautiful landscapes ,COMMA beautiful animals and incomprehensible ,COMMA people fighting senseless wars dying of poverty and aids ,COMMA unable to speak for themselves and waiting to be saved by a kind white foreigner .PERIOD now ,COMMA i've laughed every time i've read this .PERIOD so that is how to create a single story show a people as one thing as only one thing over and over again .PERIOD and that is what they become .PERIOD my cousin polle died ,COMMA because he could not get adequate healthcare ,COMMA what the nigerian writer chinua achebe calls a balance of stories .PERIOD what if my roommate knew about my nigerian publisher ,COMMA mukta bakaray ,COMMA a remarkable man ,COMMA who left his job in a bank to follow his dream and start a publishing house .PERIOD he disagreed .PERIOD he felt that people who could read would read if you made literature ,COMMA affordable and available to them .PERIOD what if my roommate knew about the female lawyer ,COMMA who recently went to court in nigeria to challenge a ridiculous law that required women to get their husband's consent before ,COMMA renewing their passports .PERIOD stories matter we face momentous decisions with important consequences throughout our lives .PERIOD and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions .PERIOD we've surrendered our power trading off .PERIOD our discomfort with uncertainty .PERIOD for the illusion of certainty that they provide it literally flat-lined .PERIOD but what my research has shown me is that experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps that within these camps ,COMMA a dominant perspective emerges that often silences opposition that experts move with the prevailing winds ,COMMA often hero-worshipping their own gurus .PERIOD a recent study in the archives of surgery ,COMMA reported surgeons removing healthy ovaries operating on the wrong side of the brain ,COMMA carrying out procedures on the wrong hand ,COMMA elbow eye foot and also mistakes born out of thinking errors .PERIOD why was it that when i had an operation ,COMMA my doctor said to me ,COMMA beware ms hertz of hyperpyrexia ,COMMA when he could have just as easily said ,COMMA watch out for a high fever .PERIOD you see being ready to take experts on is about also being willing to dig behind their graphs ,COMMA their equations ,COMMA their forecasts ,COMMA their prophecies and being armed with the questions to do that -- questions like what are the assumptions that underpin this ?QUESTIONMARK if we are to shift paradigms ,COMMA if we are to make breakthroughs ,COMMA if we are to destroy myths ,COMMA we need to create

and then we do the opec stimulus package also known as 200 dollars a barrel .PERIOD and that's the difference between problems that are additive like co2 ,COMMA which we go slowly up .PERIOD and then

.PERIOD it turns out to be in principle ,COMMA incapable of doing the job required of it .PERIOD so we're used to not challenging religious ideas .PERIOD and it's very interesting .PERIOD how much of a furor richard creates when he does it ?QUESTIONMARK he meant me ,COMMA not that one .PERIOD it teaches them to accept authority revelation and faith .PERIOD instead of always insisting on evidence

proportion to what it actually means and a stumbling block to people who otherwise might be happy to out themselves .PERIOD hence ,COMMA the phrase tooth fairy agnostic .PERIOD the onus is not on the rest of us to say ,COMMA why not ?QUESTIONMARK but we don't bother to say .PERIOD so .PERIOD and this is why my friend uses tooth fairy agnostic as a label for what most people would call atheist when atheists like stephen hawking and albert einstein use the word god ,COMMA they use it .PERIOD of course ,COMMA as a metaphorical shorthand for that deep mysterious part of physics ,COMMA which we don't yet understand .PERIOD what i want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories and talk about a different africa .PERIOD already this morning .PERIOD there were some allusions to

this is a story about the fact that people want their resources managed properly for their good and not taken out to places where they'll benefit just a few of the elite ,COMMA because if we can get

whenever their computer isn't working by running a screen saver and together sharing their resources to create a massive supercomputer that nasa harnesses to analyze the data coming from radio

was not about society itself .PERIOD it's that it's the first time that it's having major economic impact .PERIOD you have to hire them to spend a lot of time it's creating .PERIOD and it's most visible .PERIOD when we see it as a new form of competition ,COMMA peer-to-peer networks ,COMMA assaulting ,COMMA the recording industry ,COMMA free and open source software ,COMMA taking market share

particular virus ,COMMA although very scary at the time ,COMMA did not transmit from person to person very easily .PERIOD we've got these new antibodies ,COMMA we've identified .PERIOD and we know that they latch onto many many variations of the virus .PERIOD but you know ,COMMA the research that has occurred from hiv .PERIOD now has really helped with innovation with other diseases .PERIOD so far animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease ,COMMA although you might get a mild case .PERIOD it was a slow cumbersome process that depended on chicken eggs ,COMMA millions of living chicken eggs .PERIOD now think of where this leads us new infectious diseases ,COMMA appear or reappear every few years .PERIOD will we be quick enough to react before millions die .PERIOD you also can use adjuvants ,COMMA which are chemicals .PERIOD you mix .PERIOD i call them the cheetah generation .PERIOD the cheetah generation is a new breed of africans who brook no nonsense

really pretty easy .PERIOD it doesn't mean that if you are a republican that i'm trying to convince you to be a democrat ,COMMA we need republicans as well .PERIOD this used to be a bipartisan issue .PERIOD and i know that in this group ,COMMA it really is become politically active .PERIOD we have to buy a lot of those ads again .PERIOD the republicans here this shouldn't be partisan and all the burning of oil and coal and gas .PERIOD all the fossil fuels have changed the atmosphere greatly .PERIOD and one of the really most incredible things .PERIOD i think ,COMMA is that .PERIOD there's nobody out there trying to collect it at the site where it is densest .PERIOD you see people who are really shell-shocked .PERIOD so this is the gulf of mexico ,COMMA sparkling place ,COMMA full of fish .PERIOD you can see where the oil is concentrated at the surface .PERIOD and then it is attacked because they don't want the evidence .PERIOD in my opinion .PERIOD we heard that bacteria eat oil

seriously ,COMMA what's wrong with this ?QUESTIONMARK you already know enough to tell me -- what's wrong with this statement .PERIOD and so let's do a series of comparisons to show you .PERIOD i assure you ,COMMA this is very tiny .PERIOD it's just six microns on a side ,COMMA and that's just a mouse brain -- .PERIOD it's a lot smaller than a human brain .PERIOD i feel curiosity ,COMMA and i feel wonder ,COMMA but at times ,COMMA i have also felt despair .PERIOD why did i choose to study this organ that is so awesome in its complexity that it might well be infinite .PERIOD and there's a lot of evidence that neural activity is encoding ,COMMA our thoughts ,COMMA feelings and perceptions ,COMMA our mental experiences .PERIOD and if you put those two facts together ,COMMA it means that your experiences can change your connectome .PERIOD and it might true that just the mere act of thinking can change your connectome .PERIOD -- ,COMMA an idea that you may find empowering .PERIOD and so we might even speak of the stream of consciousness .PERIOD i'll give you a hint .PERIOD it's a big number .PERIOD zach ,COMMA kaplan :COLON keith .PERIOD and i lead a research team ,COMMA because

you can see from the diagram on the right .PERIOD the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet .PERIOD so i'm sure all you engineers know that ,COMMA even though aluminum is a metal .PERIOD it's not a magnetic material .PERIOD but something unexpected happens .PERIOD when you drop a magnet down ,COMMA an aluminum tube ,COMMA it's perfectly clear .PERIOD it's odorless .PERIOD it's colorless .PERIOD shape-retaining is common in metal .PERIOD you bend a piece of aluminum foil ,COMMA and it holds its place contrast that with a plastic garbage can -- .PERIOD and you can push in the

.PERIOD prior to seeing this ,COMMA we would have assumed a 10-foot pole ,COMMA couldn't fit in your pocket .PERIOD something as inexpensive as ink .PERIOD couldn't sense .PERIOD the way paper is

that's how i've been trained .PERIOD so i'm listening to all this .PERIOD you know ,COMMA and i'm like is this guy for real is he making some of this up is he like ,COMMA you know ,COMMA -- ,COMMA because he seemed to have an answer for everything .PERIOD and it was always nature ,COMMA because really ,COMMA they want you to look at themselves ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK and we're sitting there ,COMMA and i hear [clapping] from a distance .PERIOD so i look over to fly south in the winter and north when it gets warm .PERIOD and the problem with saying that ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA at this point ,COMMA it risks hyperbole really easily .PERIOD i'm really in love with him at this point .PERIOD he takes the liver when he harvests the foie gras .PERIOD he sticks them in this jar ,COMMA and he confits it ,COMMA no salt ,COMMA no pepper ,COMMA no oil ,COMMA no spices .PERIOD we went back out for the final tour of the farm ,COMMA and he showed me the wild

stop treating the planet as if it were some kind of business in liquidation ,COMMA whether we're talking about brussels sprouts or foie gras that is our poetry .PERIOD that is our beautiful story .PERIOD ok ,COMMA i can see if i found something up up and they continue up up up .PERIOD you you survive .PERIOD it's ok ,COMMA nobody's obliged to be a genius .PERIOD it's better ,COMMA but nobody .PERIOD this line of evolution is clearly positive .PERIOD but if you take a lens like that ,COMMA this line is ack ack ack ack ack ,COMMA like that ,COMMA there is different type of barbaria .PERIOD that's why today .PERIOD i'm so ashamed to make this job .PERIOD but i know that even i do it the best possible -- .PERIOD that's why i'm the best -- .PERIOD it's nothing .PERIOD and because we must

elevator .PERIOD the elevator would open -- .PERIOD there'd be this little small magic store .PERIOD you'd be in the magic store .PERIOD and so i started thinking about lost and the stuff that we do .PERIOD and i realized ,COMMA oh ,COMMA my god ,COMMA mystery boxes are everywhere in what i do .PERIOD jack get him out of here .PERIOD get him away from the engine .PERIOD get him out of here .PERIOD man :COLON hey ,COMMA hey ,COMMA hey ,COMMA get away from -- jja .PERIOD now ,COMMA 10 years ago ,COMMA if we wanted to do that ,COMMA we'd have to kill a stuntman .PERIOD and i often am like

,COMMA what are stories ?QUESTIONMARK but mystery boxes .PERIOD then there's the thing of mystery in terms of imagination ,COMMA -- the withholding of information .PERIOD you know ,COMMA doing that

maybe not the most amazing dramatic scenes in the history of time .PERIOD but pretty great scenes .PERIOD father 'cause .PERIOD i need it come on .PERIOD so you think of jaws -- .PERIOD so that's the kind of stuff that like ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the investment of character ,COMMA which is the stuff that really is inside the box .PERIOD you know ,COMMA it's why when people do sequels or rip off

restaurant ,COMMA where he transports us to the shores of acapulco up on the upper west side with this wall of cliff ,COMMA divers who -- there you go like that boo hewerdine ,COMMA thomas dolby .PERIOD thank you very much .PERIOD for inviting me .PERIOD it's been a blessing singing for you right now is the most exciting time to see new indian art .PERIOD this next artist ns harsha actually has a studio right here in mysore .PERIOD he's putting a contemporary spin on the miniature tradition .PERIOD he creates these fine delicate images ,COMMA which he then repeats on a massive scale .PERIOD this next artist is probably the alpha male of contemporary indian art subodh gupta .PERIOD but i can only hope i've whet your appetite to go out and see and learn more about the amazing things that are happening in art in india today .PERIOD so i'm going to show you some ways that we can violate your expectations .PERIOD first of all ,COMMA i want to show you the particular illusion here .PERIOD i want you first of all ,COMMA when it pops up on the screen to notice that the two holes are perpendicular to each other .PERIOD these are all perceptual tricks .PERIOD these are real objects that i'm going to show you .PERIOD now ,COMMA i'm going to show you how it is done .PERIOD i've looped the film here .PERIOD so you can get a very interesting experience .PERIOD i want you to see how this illusion is constructed ,COMMA and it's going to rotate .PERIOD so you see that it's inside out .PERIOD now ,COMMA watch as it rotates back ,COMMA how quickly your perception snaps ?QUESTIONMARK ok ,COMMA now ,COMMA how many of you here ?QUESTIONMARK see ?QUESTIONMARK dolphins .PERIOD raise your hand if you see dolphins .PERIOD ok ,COMMA those people who raised their hands afterwards .PERIOD the rest of the audience go talk to them .PERIOD all right ,COMMA actually ,COMMA this is the best example of priming by experience that i know .PERIOD now ,COMMA something like this can be used ,COMMA because this is after all talk about design too .PERIOD this was done by saatchi and saatchi ,COMMA and they actually got away with this ad in australia .PERIOD so if you look at this ad for beer ,COMMA all those people are in sort of provocative positions ,COMMA but they got it passed and actually won the clio awards .PERIOD so it's funny how you can do these things .PERIOD you can violate your expectations about experience .PERIOD here is an outside water fountain that i created with some friends of mine ,COMMA but you can stop the water in drops and -- actually make all the drops levitate .PERIOD this is something we're building for ,COMMA you know ,COMMA amusement parks .PERIOD and that kind of stuff .PERIOD well ,COMMA there's analog and digital thought that was appropriate here .PERIOD now ,COMMA i'm going to skip ahead since i'm sort of running [behind] .PERIOD i want to show you quickly what i've created some new type of illusions .PERIOD i've done something with taking the pixar-type illusions .PERIOD so you see these kids the same size here running down the hall ,COMMA the two table tops of the same size .PERIOD and it's interesting by doing this in this sort of rendered fashion ,COMMA how much stronger the illusions are any case .PERIOD i hope this has brought you a little joy and happiness .PERIOD and if you're interested in seeing more cool effects ,COMMA see me outside .PERIOD i'd be happy to show you lots of things .PERIOD so i want to share with you a couple key insights about complexity .PERIOD we're learning from studying nature that maybe are applicable to other problems .PERIOD i'm here today ,COMMA as june said to talk about a project that my twin sister and i have been doing for the past three and half years .PERIOD this is our invocation in crochet of a bleached reef .PERIOD so we went and taught the techniques we did workshops and lectures .PERIOD the frilly crenulated forms that you see in corals and kelps and sponges and nudibranchs is a form of geometry known as hyperbolic geometry .PERIOD and the only way that mathematicians know how to model this structure is with crochet .PERIOD it happens to be a fact before hyperbolic geometry .PERIOD mathematicians knew about two kinds of space ,COMMA euclidean space and spherical space .PERIOD and they have different properties .PERIOD think of the surface of a sphere ,COMMA -- ,COMMA just like a beach ball ,COMMA the surface of the earth ,COMMA and on the surface of a sphere ,COMMA a straight line is the biggest possible circle .PERIOD you can draw to a mathematician ,COMMA if there are two answers .PERIOD and the first two are zero and one ,COMMA there is another number that immediately suggests itself as the third alternative .PERIOD this nearly drove mathematicians bonkers ,COMMA because like you ,COMMA they're sitting there ,COMMA feeling bamboozled .PERIOD i've stitched euclid's parallel postulate on to the surface .PERIOD here's two creatures who've never heard of euclid's .PERIOD parallel ,COMMA postulate -- didn't know it was impossible to violate ,COMMA and they're simply getting on with it .PERIOD i once asked the mathematicians why it was that mathematicians thought this structure was impossible .PERIOD when sea slugs have been doing it since the silurian age .PERIOD and that's true ,COMMA but it also goes deeper than that .PERIOD and so too .PERIOD we've discovered that there is an infinite taxonomy of crochet hyperbolic creatures .PERIOD but we found that when we deviated from the specific setness of the mathematical code that underlies it -- ,COMMA the simple algorithm ,COMMA crochet ,COMMA three increase one -- ,COMMA when we deviated from that and made embellishments to the code .PERIOD the models immediately started to look more natural .PERIOD and kindergarten was actually a very formalized system of education established by a man named friedrich froebel ,COMMA who was a crystallographer in the 19th century .PERIOD he developed a radical alternative system of engaging the smallest children with the most abstract ideas through physical forms of play .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK so how do you study this mysterious organ ?QUESTIONMARK so let me give you a few striking examples of this .PERIOD and if you look tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes ,COMMA -- ,COMMA you can't see it there .PERIOD -- is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus .PERIOD but there's another rare syndrome .PERIOD so rare ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA that very few physicians have heard about it ,COMMA not even neurologists .PERIOD now ,COMMA the most common interpretation of this ,COMMA which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks is a freudian view .PERIOD and that is that this chap -- and the same argument applies to women by the way .PERIOD but i'll just talk about guys .PERIOD thank god ,COMMA or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother .PERIOD it's very ingenious as all freudian arguments are -- -- ,COMMA but didn't make much sense because i have seen the same delusion ,COMMA a patient having the same delusion about his pet poodle .PERIOD there are neurons there that are sensitive to faces .PERIOD now ,COMMA when that area's damaged ,COMMA you lose the ability to see faces ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK and then the message cascades into the amygdala ,COMMA and then goes down the autonomic nervous system .PERIOD there's no delusion through the phone .PERIOD and in fact ,COMMA one student asked me the other day do they get phantom pms now ?QUESTIONMARK why would a phantom limb be paralyzed ?QUESTIONMARK how do you unlearn the learned paralysis ?QUESTIONMARK so you can relieve him of this excruciating clenching spasm of the phantom arm .PERIOD he had a brachial avulsion .PERIOD so the nerves were cut .PERIOD and the arm was paralyzed lying in a sling for a year .PERIOD and then the arm was amputated .PERIOD my first patient came in ,COMMA and he looked in the mirror ,COMMA and i said ,COMMA look at your reflection of your phantom .PERIOD he knows it's a mirror reflection ,COMMA but it's a vivid sensory experience .PERIOD and he says ,COMMA oh ,COMMA my god ,COMMA my phantom is moving again .PERIOD i don't believe this .PERIOD and then i said ,COMMA close your eyes .PERIOD so i said ,COMMA look ,COMMA derek ,COMMA -- .PERIOD well ,COMMA first of all ,COMMA the guy can't just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain -- .PERIOD i said ,COMMA look ,COMMA derek ,COMMA take it home and practice with it for a week or two .PERIOD i said ,COMMA what's gone these people muddle up their senses ?QUESTIONMARK why does this happen ?QUESTIONMARK now ?QUESTIONMARK remember -- .PERIOD why does this happen ?QUESTIONMARK and that is ,COMMA there is an abnormal gene ,COMMA a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring .PERIOD so every brain region is wired to every other region .PERIOD and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain .PERIOD it's because you're all doing a cross-model synesthetic abstraction .PERIOD meaning you're saying that that sharp inflection -- ki-ki in your auditory cortex ,COMMA the hair cells ,COMMA being excited ,COMMA -- kiki ,COMMA mimics the visual inflection sudden ,COMMA inflection of that jagged shape .PERIOD now ,COMMA this is very important ,COMMA because what it's telling you is your brain is engaging in a primitive -- .PERIOD it's just -- .PERIOD it looks like a silly illusion .PERIOD but these photons in your eye are doing this shape and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern .PERIOD but the brain is able to extract the common denominator .PERIOD sorry about that .PERIOD my talk will be in two parts .PERIOD i'll talk first as an astronomer ,COMMA and then as a worried member of the human race .PERIOD so that's another project for nasa .PERIOD it landed on the surface .PERIOD this is pictures taken on the way down .PERIOD there's scant chance of life there -- .PERIOD that's because there's been no time for the nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron ,COMMA the building blocks of planets and of life .PERIOD and until we have that synthesis ,COMMA we won't be able to understand the very beginning of our universe .PERIOD because when our universe was itself ,COMMA the size of an atom ,COMMA quantum effects could shake everything you want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small .PERIOD but we want to understand the very complex .PERIOD we depend on stars to make the atoms .PERIOD we're made of .PERIOD we depend on chemistry to determine our complex structure .PERIOD the geometric mean of the mass of a proton ,COMMA and the mass of the sun is 50 kilograms within a factor of two of the mass of each person here ,COMMA if i was not a self-effacing brit ,COMMA i would mention the book myself ,COMMA and i would add that it's available in paperback .PERIOD first ,COMMA any scientific discovery has benign consequences as well as dangerous ones .PERIOD he persuaded einstein as his last act to sign the famous memorandum of bertrand russell .PERIOD we need not just campaigning physicists ,COMMA but we need biologists computer experts and environmentalists as well .PERIOD i wrote my book ,COMMA our final century as a scientist ,COMMA just a general scientist .PERIOD but there's one respect ,COMMA i think ,COMMA in which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective ,COMMA and that's that it offers an awareness of the immense future .PERIOD the stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past are now part of common culture ,COMMA -- outside the american bible belt .PERIOD anyway ,COMMA -- .PERIOD but most people ,COMMA even those who are familiar with evolution ,COMMA aren't mindful that even more time lies ahead ,COMMA the unfolding of intelligence and complexity still has immensely far to go here on earth and probably far beyond .PERIOD but ,COMMA let's suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot in the cosmos from afar ,COMMA not just for 40 years ,COMMA but for the entire 45 ,COMMA billion-year history of our earth .PERIOD then other things happened even more abruptly right now .PERIOD he's in a forest in georgia ,COMMA the bonobo ,COMMA although shorter than us and their arms still longer is more upright ,COMMA just as we are slim-bodied .PERIOD bonobos are by nature very gentle creatures .PERIOD this is kanzi .PERIOD and i in the forest we need more sticks too .PERIOD good job .PERIOD video :COLON kanzi now makes his tools ,COMMA just as our ancestors may have made them .PERIOD two-and-a-half million years ago ,COMMA -- by holding the rocks in both hands to strike one against the other .PERIOD kanzi's rock is from gona ethiopia ,COMMA and is identical to that used by our african ancestors .PERIOD two-and-a-half million years ago ,COMMA she's also saying ,COMMA the name of that with her voice panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor .PERIOD ss very nice ,COMMA beautiful .PERIOD panbanisha .PERIOD the curved line is very similar to the lexigram .PERIOD the next symbol panbanisha writes represents collar .PERIOD researchers began to record what panbanisha said by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk .PERIOD then he peers eagerly into his mother's mouth .PERIOD narrator :COLON kanzi plays the xylophone using both hands .PERIOD he enthusiastically accompanies dr sue's singing kanzi and panbanisha are stimulated by this fun-filled environment ,COMMA which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities .PERIOD so we have a bi-species environment .PERIOD we call it a panhomoculture .PERIOD here's a site ,COMMA which allows you to look at recovery spending in california .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA this is the graph of the number of data sets in the repositories of datagov and datagovuk .PERIOD and then you can select also other things on the map to see what other factors like the threat level .PERIOD the light blue is refugee camps .PERIOD these volunteers had spotted from the [satellite images] .PERIOD so if you've been involved in that at all ,COMMA i just wanted to say whatever you've been doing ,COMMA whether you've just been chanting raw data .PERIOD now ,COMMA a man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens ,COMMA it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space .PERIOD within a year ,COMMA congress funded huge weapons increases .PERIOD and we went from 1200 nuclear weapons to 20000 support for engineering math and science ,COMMA -- education in general ,COMMA -- boomed .PERIOD and so if you'll put up with this ,COMMA i would like to enlist your help with a first experiment today ,COMMA the experiment is -- .PERIOD and i notice ,COMMA by the way that when you applauded that you did it in a typical north american way that is ,COMMA you were raucous and incoherent .PERIOD so what do we make of that ?QUESTIONMARK first of all ,COMMA we know that you're all brilliant .PERIOD do you need to be alive ?QUESTIONMARK i mean ,COMMA that's a spooky thought ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK and you see that in nature ,COMMA keep in mind that although it looks as if each individual is acting to cooperate .PERIOD what's really going on is a kind of selfish darwinian behavior .PERIOD each is scattering away at random to try to save its scales or feathers .PERIOD as i say ,COMMA if you're in a swarm ,COMMA your odds of being the

perfect time together in perfect synchrony to reinforce a message to the females scientific papers were published saying ,COMMA it was twitching eyelids that explained it ,COMMA or ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a human being's tendency to see patterns where there are none .PERIOD but i hope you've convinced yourself now ,COMMA with this nighttime ,COMMA video that they really were very well synchronized .PERIOD okay ,COMMA well ,COMMA the issue then is do we need to be alive to see this kind of spontaneous order ?QUESTIONMARK and i've already hinted that the answer is no now you might think that's a bizarre idea .PERIOD he would shoot his light saber across the abyss ,COMMA making a blade of light ,COMMA and then scamper across on this blade of light .PERIOD think of the bridge as being like this platform .PERIOD narrator :COLON the most dramatic and shocking footage shows whole sections of the crowd ,COMMA -- ,COMMA hundreds of people -- apparently ,COMMA rocking from side to

?QUESTIONMARK allan mcrobie is a bridge engineer from cambridge ,COMMA who wrote to me suggesting that a bridge simulator ought to wobble in the same way as the real bridge -- provided we hung it on pendulums of exactly the right length .PERIOD their instructions just walk .PERIOD normally that indeed ,COMMA a mass extinction was underway in our fields in our agricultural system .PERIOD so if i were to going to show you all the beans in the world ,COMMA and i had a slide like this ,COMMA and i switched it .PERIOD every second ,COMMA it would take up my entire ted talk .PERIOD and i wouldn't

like to share with you .PERIOD and i would like in a minute to thank philips for helping .PERIOD i'm really troubled by that .PERIOD but anyway ,COMMA that's -- the basis of the thing that i want to share with you today ,COMMA though ,COMMA is that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later aviation week ,COMMA asked me to make a list of who i thought were the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation .PERIOD well ,COMMA what happened when i was a little kid was -- ,COMMA some pretty heavy stuff too .PERIOD and this was at a time when mars was a

and very quickly ,COMMA you'll see those resort .PERIOD hotels in orbit .PERIOD there's a group of people that have come forward -- ,COMMA and you don't know all of them -- .PERIOD but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children .PERIOD this little three- to 15-year-old age by us going to orbit and going to the moon here ,COMMA right in this time period .PERIOD paul allen ,COMMA elan musk .PERIOD richard branson :COLON jeff bezos ,COMMA the ansari family ,COMMA which is now funding the russians' sub-orbital thing .PERIOD bob bigelow ,COMMA a private space station and

ticket and fly higher and faster than the highest-performance military operational airplane .PERIOD it's never happened before .PERIOD you can fly with russian hardware .PERIOD this is available ,COMMA because a russian space program is starving ,COMMA and it's nice for them to get 20 million here ,COMMA and there to take one of the seats ,COMMA and every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by a factor of 10 to 15 .PERIOD and what that means is before we know it the progress in human space flight with no taxpayer dollars will be at a level of about five times as much as the current nasa budgets for human space flight .PERIOD and this realization is allowing us to reconceptualize the way that we actually approach these diseases by controlling angiogenesis .PERIOD now i'm going to focus on cancer ,COMMA because angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer every type of cancer .PERIOD this is a tumor .PERIOD dark gray .PERIOD ominous mass growing inside a brain dr ,COMMA judah folkman ,COMMA who was my mentor ,COMMA and who was the pioneer of the angiogenesis field once called this cancer without disease .PERIOD and unfortunately ,COMMA this late stage of cancer is the one at which it's most likely to be diagnosed when angiogenesis is already turned on .PERIOD and cancer cells are growing like wild .PERIOD we call this antiangiogenic therapy ,COMMA and it's completely different from chemotherapy ,COMMA because it selectively aims at the blood vessels that are feeding the cancers .PERIOD well ,COMMA i've just shown you two very different types of cancer that both responded to antiangiogenic therapy ,COMMA and we subsequently treated more than 600 dogs .PERIOD it had already spread to his lymph nodes .PERIOD so we used an antiangiogenic skin cream for the lip and an oral cocktail .PERIOD so we could treat from the inside as well as the outside .PERIOD and in fact ,COMMA the first pioneering treatments for people as well as dogs are already becoming available .PERIOD but the real question is how well do these work in practice ?QUESTIONMARK so ,COMMA here's actually the patient survival data from eight different types of cancer ,COMMA but for other tumors and cancer types .PERIOD the improvements have only been modest .PERIOD and as a doctor ,COMMA i know that once a disease progresses to an advanced stage achieving a cure can be difficult ,COMMA if not impossible .PERIOD but i actually took a completely opposite approach and began asking ,COMMA what could we be adding to our diet ?QUESTIONMARK that's naturally antiangiogenic that could boost the body's defense system and beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers .PERIOD this inhibits abnormal angiogenesis by 60 percent .PERIOD and you can see clearly that the teas vary in their potency from less potent to more potent .PERIOD this means there's food synergy .PERIOD here's some more data from our testing .PERIOD now ,COMMA in the lab ,COMMA we can simulate tumor angiogenesis represented here in a black bar soy parsley garlic grapes .PERIOD berries .PERIOD i could go home and cook a tasty meal using these ingredients .PERIOD and like a tumor fat grows when blood vessels grow .PERIOD albert szent-gyorgi once said ,COMMA that discovery consists of seeing what everyone has seen and thinking what no one has thought right .PERIOD and along those lines for people who might have risk factors for cancer ,COMMA would you recommend pursuing any treatments sort of prophylactically ,COMMA or simply pursuing the right diet with lots of tomato sauce ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA there's abundant epidemiological evidence .PERIOD i've designed puzzles for books ,COMMA printed things ,COMMA but at best they can reach for something more and create a memorable impression .PERIOD it's all figure not strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense .PERIOD now ,COMMA if you could pick up the black vase ,COMMA it would look like the figure on top here .PERIOD let's make it a little harder .PERIOD still pretty easy .PERIOD i wanted to make a sequel garry trudeau calls himself ,COMMA an investigative cartoonist .PERIOD and i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA how on earth ?QUESTIONMARK can you come up with a sequence of the base pairs in dna ?QUESTIONMARK and you have to choose pieces that overlap on the edge .PERIOD but it takes some persistence .PERIOD first of all ,COMMA you know ,COMMA for a long time ,COMMA computer games meant things like doom ,COMMA where you're going around ,COMMA shooting things very violent games ,COMMA very fast aimed at teenage boys .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK that's who plays computer games .PERIOD well guess what that's changing .PERIOD and it's a game you play with other people .PERIOD a lot of people do sudoku .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA some doctors prescribe it .PERIOD anybody ?QUESTIONMARK what i want to talk about today is this particular cell or grouping of cells that is in each .PERIOD and every one of us i want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells is central to the evolution of our species and the continuation of the human race .PERIOD and i want you imagine that at some point in history ,COMMA a group of powerful people invested in owning ,COMMA and controlling the world understood that the suppression of this particular cell ,COMMA the oppression of these cells ,COMMA the reinterpretation of these cells ,COMMA the undermining of these cells ,COMMA getting us to believe in the weakness of these cells ,COMMA and the crushing eradicating destroying reducing these cells basically began the process of killing off the girl cell ,COMMA which was by the way patriarchy to be a leader means not to be a girl .PERIOD and i'd also like to say that the irony ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is that denying girl suppressing girl suppressing emotion .PERIOD refusing feeling has lead .PERIOD thus here where we have now come to live in a

.PERIOD when she got to the house ,COMMA i had the privilege of being in the hut when she was reunited with her father and reconciled in that hut .PERIOD we walked in and her father and his four wives were sitting there and her sisters ,COMMA who had just returned because they had all fled when she had fled .PERIOD and her primary mother who had been beaten in standing up for her with the elders .PERIOD and that is the power of transformation .PERIOD but i really want to do it for each ,COMMA and every person here to value the girl in us to value the part that cries to value the part that's

mecho-gecko .PERIOD here's an individual hair with a little split end .PERIOD there no force is too low .PERIOD do they do it by electrostatics ?QUESTIONMARK and just recently ,COMMA we've made a breakthrough where we now believe we're going to be able to create the first synthetic self-cleaning dry adhesive .PERIOD many companies are interested in this .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD we proved that ,COMMA most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong .PERIOD most people have cooking fires in the world ,COMMA whether it's camel ,COMMA dung or wood .PERIOD and the problem is this :COLON women are not making it to the top of any profession anywhere in the world .PERIOD we also have another problem ,COMMA which is that women face harder choices between professional success and personal fulfillment .PERIOD and i said ,COMMA are you telling me that i am the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year in the high-income part of our workforce in the people who end up at the top -- fortune 500 ,COMMA ceo jobs ,COMMA or the equivalent in other industries -- .PERIOD the problem i am convinced is that women are dropping out .PERIOD this is hard .PERIOD i feel guilty .PERIOD sometimes my brother is kind of busy because what the data shows above .PERIOD all else is one thing ,COMMA which is that success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women .PERIOD this is the complication ,COMMA and that's a problem ,COMMA because we have to make it as important a job ,COMMA because it's the hardest job in the world to work inside the home for people of both genders ,COMMA if we're going to even things out and let women stay in the workforce message number three ,COMMA don't leave before you leave .PERIOD and literally from that moment ,COMMA she doesn't raise her hand anymore .PERIOD she doesn't look for a promotion .PERIOD she doesn't take on the new project .PERIOD she doesn't say me .PERIOD i want to do that .PERIOD my generation really sadly is not going to change the numbers at the top .PERIOD if you want to get at the big part -- ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA from a public health level where my training is -- .PERIOD you're looking at behavioral issues .PERIOD we talk about it in terms of engagement or non-compliance .PERIOD so the crux of it comes down to this notion of decision-making -- ,COMMA giving information to people in a form that doesn't just educate them or inform them .PERIOD but actually leads them to make better decisions ,COMMA better choices in their lives .PERIOD so they asked them at the beginning .PERIOD do you think you'll actually be able to stick with this program .PERIOD so fear showed up as not really the driver .PERIOD it was a notion that really came out of albert bandura's work who studied whether people could get a sense of empowerment .PERIOD it's an amazing notion .PERIOD and i had to explain they're trying to scare people again ,COMMA bandura recognized this years ago ,COMMA decades ago .PERIOD okay ,COMMA i know where i sit ,COMMA i know where i'm situated .PERIOD and that doesn't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers -- .PERIOD this overload of health information that we're inundated with .PERIOD finally ,COMMA we need to be presented with a clear point of action .PERIOD the choice ,COMMA in this case is pretty simple .PERIOD we either keep going fast ,COMMA or we slow down .PERIOD they reduce speeds by about five to 10 percent .PERIOD they last for about five miles in which case we put our foot back on the pedal .PERIOD and who among us would actually say that people who do try to read this actually get anything out of it .PERIOD they went to the nutritional information box and saw that what works for cereal works for our food actually helps people understand what's in their food .PERIOD they're just not for us .PERIOD they're not for people .PERIOD they're not for patients .PERIOD this is the worst presented information .PERIOD and then we go a further step -- .PERIOD we tell them what they can do .PERIOD so we take the bold step of putting the cholesterol information on the same page ,COMMA which is the way the doctor is going to evaluate it .PERIOD the last one i'll show you is a psa test .PERIOD and the only acceptable answer is -- -- .PERIOD yes ,COMMA okay ,COMMA on the other hand ,COMMA by placing your finger in a different position on the fingerboard ,COMMA it changes the string length that changes the frequency of the sound wave .PERIOD and now i realize that as the musician ,COMMA we human beings .PERIOD we have a great mind ,COMMA artistic heart and skill that can change the 16th-century technology and a legendary design to a wonderful entertainment .PERIOD but although some of them were quite up there for me ,COMMA and i realized we actually had quite a bit in common .PERIOD both of us were disseminating the genes of one species and not another ,COMMA and both of us -- ,COMMA probably ,COMMA if i can imagine ,COMMA the bee's point of view ,COMMA -- thought we were calling the shots .PERIOD we have a grammar that suggests that's who we are that .PERIOD we are sovereign subjects in nature ,COMMA the bee as well as me .PERIOD and that's when i got the idea ,COMMA which was well ,COMMA what would happen if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who are working on us ?QUESTIONMARK and agriculture suddenly appeared to me ,COMMA not as an invention ,COMMA not as a human technology ,COMMA but as a co-evolutionary development in which a group of very clever species ,COMMA mostly edible grasses had exploited us figured out how to get us to basically deforest the world .PERIOD and suddenly everything looked different .PERIOD i'm a dupe .PERIOD i'm a dupe of the lawns whose goal in life is to outcompete the trees who they compete with for sunlight .PERIOD so let me go through what you gain .PERIOD when you look at the world ,COMMA this way ,COMMA besides some entertaining insights about human desire ,COMMA as an intellectual matter ,COMMA looking at the world from other species' points of view helps us deal with this weird anomaly ,COMMA which is -- .PERIOD and this is in the realm of intellectual history -- ,COMMA which is that we have this darwinian revolution 150 years ago .PERIOD this is a farm in the shenandoah valley of virginia .PERIOD the idea is he's got six different species of animals as well as some plants growing in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement .PERIOD and i'll show you if you take this approach ,COMMA what you get .PERIOD ok .PERIOD so one day cattle in a pen ,COMMA the eggmobile is a very rickety contraption -- .PERIOD it looks like a prairie schooner made out of boards -- ,COMMA but it houses 350 chickens .PERIOD so the chickens do their kind of little breakdance ,COMMA and they're pushing around the manure to get at the grubs .PERIOD and in the process ,COMMA they're spreading the manure out ,COMMA and within four or five weeks ,COMMA he can do it again ,COMMA put that in play .PERIOD so when they lose a lot of leaf mass ,COMMA they shed roots ,COMMA they kind of cauterize them .PERIOD and the roots die ,COMMA and they're labeled by color ,COMMA right now by language .PERIOD but you can also see ,COMMA there are places where there's not so much ,COMMA but it didn't have quite the same pickup in the us .PERIOD and so i guess the us .PERIOD finally ,COMMA finally started to like it too .PERIOD and it's something i'm very excited to be a part of ,COMMA but it was a dream of his .PERIOD and we basically ,COMMA when people really want to do something ,COMMA well ,COMMA we generally let them .PERIOD you can see ,COMMA even though the us is still the majority here -- ,COMMA though ,COMMA by the way search-wise ,COMMA it's only about 30 percent of our traffic -- ,COMMA but it's already going to japan and the uk and europe ,COMMA and all the rest of the countries and -- .PERIOD well ,COMMA i'll leave you in suspense .PERIOD so one of the things -- ,COMMA both ,COMMA sergey ,COMMA and i went to a montessori school ,COMMA and i think ,COMMA for some reason ,COMMA this has been incorporated in google and sergey mentioned orkut ,COMMA which is something that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA orkut wanted to do in his time .PERIOD and we call this -- at google .PERIOD we've embodied this as the 20 percent time .PERIOD and the idea is for 20 percent of your time .PERIOD if you're working at google ,COMMA you can do what you think is the best thing to do .PERIOD and this was kind of a surprise to me ,COMMA but we found that as long as you keep the 100 things in your head ,COMMA which you did by writing them down that you could do a pretty good job ,COMMA deciding what to do and where to put your resources .PERIOD so this is a new -- .PERIOD how many of you use the google toolbar ?QUESTIONMARK and the nice thing about this ?QUESTIONMARK we have a self-serve program ,COMMA and many thousands of websites have signed up .PERIOD and this ,COMMA let's them really make money .PERIOD and i -- ,COMMA you know ,COMMA there's a number of people i met -- .PERIOD i met this guy who runs a conservation site at a party .PERIOD and he said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i wasn't making any money .PERIOD and so there is this blog of a young person who was kind of depressed .PERIOD and he said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i'm sleeping a lot .PERIOD and i think we're really lucky to have that kind of business model ,COMMA because everyone in the world has access to our search .PERIOD and i think that's a tremendous tremendous benefit .PERIOD so i'm also fairly determined to try and build a game layer on top of the world .PERIOD it's not very good .PERIOD it's cluttered .PERIOD if you're not too bad ,COMMA there's nothing you can do .PERIOD it's actually about using dynamics using forces to influence the behavior of where you are ,COMMA what you do there .PERIOD how you do it come here at a certain time ,COMMA get your drinks half off this game dynamic is so powerful that it doesn't just influence our behavior .PERIOD it's influenced our entire culture .PERIOD they will return like clockwork at different times ,COMMA modern warfare .PERIOD one of the most successful selling games of all time .PERIOD it's also used in more conventional settings and can be used more consciously in conventional settings school ,COMMA -- .PERIOD and remember ,COMMA i made it through one year .PERIOD so i think i'm qualified to talk on school .PERIOD -- is a game .PERIOD it's just not a terribly well-designed game .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK there are statuses .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA what is valedictorian ,COMMA but a status that sucks ?QUESTIONMARK why not level-up ?QUESTIONMARK and it's very powerful .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA you see ,COMMA this is a paladin level 10 ,COMMA and that's a paladin level 20 .PERIOD and if you were going to fight ,COMMA you know ,COMMA orcs on the fields of mordor against the raz ,COMMA al ghul ,COMMA you'd probably want to be the bigger one ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK their most dedicated players .PERIOD it's like a full-time job ,COMMA and we've introduced a progression dynamic into it where by going to the same place over and over by doing challenges by engaging with the business ,COMMA you move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right edge of the screen .PERIOD and you eventually unlock rewards .PERIOD so we have to use this one carefully .PERIOD it's a woodworking machine ,COMMA or at least a piece of one .PERIOD and my task was to make this thing a little bit more modern ,COMMA a little bit easier to use .PERIOD now ,COMMA this gentleman isambard kingdom ,COMMA brunel designed many great things in his career in the 19th century ,COMMA including the clifton suspension bridge in bristol and the thames tunnel at rotherhithe ,COMMA his greatest creation runs actually ,COMMA right through here in oxford .PERIOD he imagined an integrated transportation system in which it would be possible for a passenger to embark on a train in london and disembark from a ship in new york .PERIOD and i'd like to talk about some of those just for the next few minutes .PERIOD so it took a team working in india with patients and community health workers to understand how a pda and an application on a pda might replace those technicians in a fitting and diagnostic service .PERIOD and the faster we do that the faster our ideas evolve .PERIOD this is the manufacturing facility for one of their biggest cost breakthroughs .PERIOD they went from retreating to the nurse's station to discuss the various states and needs of patients to developing a system that happened on the ward in front of patients ,COMMA using a simple software tool .PERIOD and this is just one of thousands of opportunities in healthcare alone .PERIOD but again ,COMMA we are in the midst of massive change .PERIOD how might we improve access to safe drinking water for the world's poorest people ?QUESTIONMARK and at the same time ,COMMA stimulate innovation amongst local water providers ,COMMA what kinds of questions do ?QUESTIONMARK we think design thinking could be used to tackle ?QUESTIONMARK there is a hash tag there that you can use #cbdq .PERIOD well ,COMMA since i couldn't have my tea ,COMMA the way i wanted it .PERIOD i ordered a cup of coffee ,COMMA which the waiter brought over promptly .PERIOD but from the japanese perspective ,COMMA it's their duty to protect those who don't know any better -- .PERIOD in this case ,COMMA the ignorant gaijin -- from making the wrong choice as i do .PERIOD so i hope you'll start thinking about some of your own assumptions and how they were shaped by your backgrounds .PERIOD it is essential for success .PERIOD the kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do .PERIOD and they even got to choose which marker .PERIOD they would write their answers with in reality .PERIOD the kids who were told what to do whether by miss smith ,COMMA or their mothers were actually given the very same activity ,COMMA which their counterparts in the first group had freely chosen .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA some of the kids were visibly embarrassed when they were told that their mothers had been consulted .PERIOD the first-generation children were strongly influenced by their immigrant ,COMMA parents' approach to choice .PERIOD or you could say that the individual's preferences were shaped by the preferences of specific others ,COMMA americans train their whole lives to play spot .PERIOD the difference .PERIOD a number of my studies have shown that when you give people 10 or more options ,COMMA when they're making a choice ,COMMA they make poorer decisions ,COMMA whether it be health care investment other critical areas .PERIOD they'd already picked out a name for her barbara .PERIOD after her grandmother ,COMMA unable to breathe on her own .PERIOD she was put on a ventilator ,COMMA this narrative promises so much freedom .PERIOD happiness success .PERIOD instead of replacing one story with another ,COMMA we can learn from and revel in the many versions that exist and the many that have yet to be written ,COMMA no matter where we're from .PERIOD and what your narrative is ,COMMA we all have a responsibility to open ourselves up to a wider array of what choice can do .PERIOD and what it can represent .PERIOD it brings us that much closer to realizing the full potential of choice ,COMMA to inspiring the hope and achieving the freedom that choice promises ,COMMA but doesn't always deliver .PERIOD so i brought these two bottles of nail polish into the laboratory ,COMMA and i stripped the labels off well ,COMMA good morning ,COMMA and it's not just what these are doing to each other .PERIOD but it's what the audience thinks that really frames .PERIOD this matter to get a sense of this ,COMMA and it's been a theme .PERIOD we've talked about all week .PERIOD i recently talked to a bunch of tweeners girl 5 ,COMMA because they're going to lose all their money .PERIOD eventually doesn't work out too well for them .PERIOD they lose money .PERIOD the rocket's position is shown by the trajectory that we're now looking at .PERIOD and as it reaches the peak of its trajectory ,COMMA the velocity ,COMMA you will notice has dropped off to a minimum .PERIOD but like ,COMMA let's imagine .PERIOD we took the latest pentium processor ,COMMA the latest core 2 extreme ,COMMA which is a four-core processor that intel's working on ,COMMA it will be our laptop tomorrow .PERIOD so -- .PERIOD and we haven't even worked out .PERIOD the cooling needs .PERIOD every effort has been made and will continue to be made to find a new pattern ,COMMA new selling arrangements and new types of programs .PERIOD that may arrest the declining revenues .PERIOD it may yet be possible to eke out a poor existence for radio .PERIOD but i don't know how it was the dawn of interactive tv .PERIOD and you may have noticed they wanted to sell you the winky dink kits pete .PERIOD i could use any ordinary open-source crayon .PERIOD why do i have to buy theirs ,COMMA but we will discuss this scandal .PERIOD because this man jack berry ,COMMA the host of winky dink went on to become the host of .PERIOD twenty one ,COMMA one of the most important quiz shows ever .PERIOD we'll talk a little bit more about him later .PERIOD it's the era of big business and data centers for computing .PERIOD it all happened within five miles of where i'm standing at stanford university between 1960 and 1975 hypercard was the first program to introduce the public to hyperlinks where you could randomly hook to any kind of picture or piece of text or data across a file system .PERIOD and we had no way of explaining it once .PERIOD it was only a dream of technoids and a few long-forgotten politicians and further stimulus came with the deregulation of the cable television industry ,COMMA and the re-regulation of the cable television industry .PERIOD voice 2 next on the gourmet ,COMMA pet channel ,COMMA decorating birthday cakes for your schnauzer .PERIOD we come into the era of the dotcom ,COMMA the world wide web .PERIOD and i don't need to tell you about that ,COMMA because we all went through that bubble together .PERIOD voice 1 ,COMMA you'll have to stay here in the safe house until we get word .PERIOD the terrorist threat is over and media companies realize the audience is important also .PERIOD and i think this is beginning to happen in the entertainment business .PERIOD they think of the old medium ,COMMA because the old medium is always the content of the new medium as movies tend to be the content of tv .PERIOD and as books used to be the content novels used to be the content of movies .PERIOD and i used three criteria .PERIOD the first was ,COMMA i thought i'd talk about real design within reach design .PERIOD that's free ,COMMA not design ,COMMA not quite within reach ,COMMA as we're fondly known by our competition and competitors ,COMMA but stuff that you can find on the streets stuff that was free stuff that was available to all people and stuff that probably contains some other important messages wholly inconsistent with san francisco or new york .PERIOD how did i get started in this business in italy ?QUESTIONMARK you know ,COMMA almost everything kind of looks good .PERIOD i've come across some other ,COMMA just kind of curious relationships of bollards on the street that have different interpretations ,COMMA but -- ,COMMA these things amuse me ,COMMA and i came down one day and all the bikes were red .PERIOD and at that moment ,COMMA the sun came out .PERIOD and through this perforated screen ,COMMA a pattern was cast over these bodies ,COMMA and they kind of faded into the rear .PERIOD and we left the restaurant kind of feeling ,COMMA ok about stuff .PERIOD cities are the place where we're most likely to encounter diversity and to mix with other people .PERIOD and it's a welcoming area .PERIOD i think inclusive of diversity reflective of diversity .PERIOD and i think this marriage of both technology and art in the public sector is an area where the us .PERIOD and i decided i had to get closer than just drawing fantasy airplanes .PERIOD you had to learn what made an airplane stay in the air .PERIOD i had to learn mathematics and mechanics and all this sort of thing .PERIOD so i chose furniture ,COMMA and i chose chairs specifically ,COMMA because i knew something about them .PERIOD there are drawbacks to this one is you can't accommodate everybody .PERIOD so he said ,COMMA well ,COMMA i'll come over and look at it .PERIOD so here we are .PERIOD so if you watch this chair ,COMMA as i recline ,COMMA the headrest comes up to meet my neck .PERIOD you cant hit your elbow on bottom .PERIOD what does that mean ,COMMA my environment ?QUESTIONMARK and you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places .PERIOD you spend it at rest ,COMMA and you spend it at work .PERIOD so then i decided to leave that part of the world .PERIOD and i was going to go to the mid-west ,COMMA very nice .PERIOD and there ,COMMA my older senior lungs as i like to call them .PERIOD i filled with particulate matter ,COMMA carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone .PERIOD okay ,COMMA almost like the highest in the nation .PERIOD so what's wrong with this picture ?QUESTIONMARK they haven't asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that i put in my mouth or the food that i ingest into my stomach .PERIOD now ,COMMA i've circled the places where i've been ,COMMA oh ,COMMA not so lucky .PERIOD they give us some sense of what's going to be our train wreck .PERIOD and all of those black dots are all of the toxic release inventories that are monitored by the epa .PERIOD this is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room ,COMMA instead of just the pink slip that said ,COMMA i paid at the counter right .PERIOD and i believe that geographic information can make both you and me very healthy .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD so they take you to gruff-ex-cop-on-his-fourth-marriagedad .PERIOD i'd be like some kind of internet genius and me .PERIOD i'd like to upgrade to deity .PERIOD and maybe just like that ,COMMA -- pop -- .PERIOD i'd go wireless .PERIOD i could zip through your servers and firewalls ,COMMA like a virus ,COMMA until the world wide web is as wise as wild .PERIOD and as organized as i think a modern-day miracle/oracle can get but ooh-eee ,COMMA you want to bet ,COMMA just how whack and un-pc your mac or pc is going to be when i'm rocking hot-shit-hot-shot-godnet .PERIOD you don't say a prayer .PERIOD thank you ted .PERIOD so for roughly 300 years ,COMMA the hot debate in architecture was whether the number five or the number seven was a better proportion to think about architecture ,COMMA because the nose was one-fifth of your head ,COMMA or because your head was one-seventh of your body .PERIOD so whenever you lost information ,COMMA you'd move to symmetry .PERIOD whenever you added information to a system ,COMMA you would break symmetry .PERIOD now ,COMMA the only way we could design that or possibly construct it is by using a calculus-based definition of the form .PERIOD it also is much more dynamic ,COMMA so that you can see that the same form opens and closes in a very dynamic way as you move across it ,COMMA because it has this quality of vector in motion built into it .PERIOD you just need to incorporate a certain number of traits in a very kind of genetic way .PERIOD i won't go into too much description of any of these projects .PERIOD but what you can see is that the escalators and elevators that circulate people along the face of the building are all held up by 122 structural trusses .PERIOD so working with bentley and microstation ,COMMA we've written a custom piece of software that networks all of the components together into these chunks of information .PERIOD so that if we change any element along the length of the building ,COMMA not only does that change distribute through each one of the trusses ,COMMA but each one of the trusses ,COMMA then distributes that information down the length of the entire facade of the building .PERIOD but what it gives us is a harmonic and synthesized relationship of all these components one to another at the same time .PERIOD there's a person paying 30000 dollars for a 300-series car ,COMMA and a person paying 70000 dollars for a 700 series .PERIOD and that person paying more than double doesn't want their car to look too much like the bottom-of-the-market car .PERIOD so they have to also discriminate between these products to go back to architecture .PERIOD what's organic about architecture as a field ,COMMA unlike product design is this whole issue of holism ,COMMA and of monumentality is really our realm .PERIOD and to do that ,COMMA we tried to connect up the five towers into a single system with united architects .PERIOD also we made a proposal for the european central bank headquarters that used the same system .PERIOD but this time in a much more monolithic mass like a sphere .PERIOD so for these interiors ,COMMA like this shop in stockholm ,COMMA sweden ,COMMA or this installation wall ,COMMA in the netherlands ,COMMA at the netherlands ,COMMA architecture institute ,COMMA we could use the texture that the tool would leave to produce a lot of the spatial effects .PERIOD and we could integrate the texture of the wall with the form of the wall with the material .PERIOD what i'd like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter ,COMMA and actually all the way down into the sewer ,COMMA because i want to talk about diarrhea .PERIOD and in particular ,COMMA i want to talk about the design of diarrhea .PERIOD if instead transmission to another host requires host mobility ,COMMA then we expect that the winners of the competition will be the milder organisms .PERIOD so one way you can test is just look at all diarrheal bacteria and see whether or not the ones that tend to be more transmitted by water tend to be more harmful .PERIOD after a few days of infection ,COMMA you end up having -- the fecal material really isn't so disgusting as we might imagine .PERIOD and if you took a drop of that water ,COMMA you might find a million diarrheal organisms .PERIOD if it didn't produce a lot of this toxin ,COMMA then you might find a smaller number .PERIOD so the task is to try to figure out how to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this to evolve towards mildness .PERIOD by blocking waterborne transmission ,COMMA thereby allowing the organism only to be transmitted by person-to-person contact ,COMMA or person-food-person contact ,COMMA -- ,COMMA both of which would really require that people be mobile and fairly healthy for transmission .PERIOD one would be to take a lot of different strains of this organism -- ,COMMA some that produce a lot of toxins ,COMMA some that produce a little -- and take those strains and spew them out in different countries .PERIOD so we don't want to run an experiment like that .PERIOD now ,COMMA i don't know how that happened and i didn't have anything to do with it .PERIOD i promise you ,COMMA the goal is to turn this around ,COMMA if you could cause an evolutionary decrease in virulence by cleaning up the water supply ,COMMA you should be able to get an evolutionary decrease in antibiotic resistance .PERIOD and i want to give you just one more example ,COMMA because we've talked a little bit about malaria in the case of malaria .PERIOD what we'd like to do is mosquito-proof houses ,COMMA the only pathogens that get transmitted are the ones that are infecting people that feel healthy enough to walk outside and get mosquito bites .PERIOD so i don't really have time to talk about those things ,COMMA but i did want to put them up there .PERIOD just to give you a sense that there really are solutions to controlling the evolution of harmfulness of some of the nasty pathogens that we're confronted with .PERIOD and the data really do support this that you actually do get the virus evolving towards mildness .PERIOD anyhow ,COMMA i'll end that there .PERIOD and thank you very much .PERIOD our hands are amazing instruments .PERIOD and when they're missing ,COMMA it's a barrier .PERIOD every time you contract a muscle ,COMMA it emits a little electricity that you can record with antennae or electrodes ,COMMA and use that to operate the motorized prosthesis .PERIOD well ,COMMA the body works by starting a motor command in your brain ,COMMA going down your spinal cord out ,COMMA the nerves and to your periphery .PERIOD and we take the nerve away from your chest muscle and let these nerves grow into it .PERIOD now you think close hand and a little section of your chest contracts and jesse's ,COMMA a good crane operator .PERIOD and he did okay by our standards .PERIOD so this is really exciting for us ,COMMA because now we have a portal a portal or a way to potentially give back sensation so that he might feel what he touches with his prosthetic hand .PERIOD we've also gone on with what was initially our primary population of people with above-the-elbow amputations .PERIOD you had to concentrate a whole lot .PERIOD then we fit her with a prosthesis ,COMMA a little faster and much more easy ,COMMA much more natural .PERIOD there's a lot of information in those nerve signals ,COMMA and we wanted to get more .PERIOD and here you can see on jesse's chest when he just tried to do three different things .PERIOD you can see three different patterns .PERIOD obviously ,COMMA that's heavy for amanda .PERIOD it took just about probably three to four hours to get it to train .PERIOD so we're really excited because now we're getting to a clinically practical device .PERIOD i want you to watch closely that's claudia .PERIOD and that was the first time she got to feel sensation through her prosthetic once we can do it that small .PERIOD it's a lot easier making them bigger .PERIOD so amanda came jet-lagged .PERIOD she's using the arm and everything goes wrong .PERIOD and none of those problems could i have dealt with ,COMMA but i have a really bright research team .PERIOD but first ,COMMA i want to start by saying that we need a new operating system for the oceans ,COMMA and for the earth ,COMMA because we've only doubled the population of the earth since the 1960s -- ,COMMA a little more than doubled -- .PERIOD but we have 67 billion people in the world ,COMMA and we all like to consume humans without fins ,COMMA 90 meters 35 minutes .PERIOD so penguins are amazing athletes .PERIOD and more importantly ,COMMA they're well-dressed .PERIOD if you go and do it now ,COMMA the national parks count about 500 .PERIOD so we have a quarter of the penguins that we did 40 years ago ,COMMA when we have extreme el nino events ,COMMA you see all this red .PERIOD and you see ,COMMA no green out here around the galapagos things die when there's no food .PERIOD and if you look along the coast of argentina ,COMMA where i work now at a place called punta tombo -- ,COMMA the largest magellanic penguin colony in the world down here about 44 degrees ,COMMA south ,COMMA latitude ,COMMA -- ,COMMA you see that there's great variation here .PERIOD and so we have started a global penguin society to try to focus on the real plight of penguins .PERIOD they ended up swimming through ballast water that had oil in it .PERIOD so we ended up spending nine years convincing the government that there were lots of oiled penguins .PERIOD and of course ,COMMA all of this then leads to a vicious cycle ,COMMA and you can't raise a lot of chicks .PERIOD turbo has taken to knocking on the door with his beak .PERIOD we let him in .PERIOD and he comes in here .PERIOD so this is turbo .PERIOD and now he's looking at the other guy saying ,COMMA you are really weird .PERIOD most important thing is only you can change yourself ,COMMA and only you can change the world and make it better for people as well as penguins .PERIOD but let's talk about the 90 percent of the world population that will never leave the place in which they were born over 50 .PERIOD new countries were born ,COMMA and they share a lengthy land border .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA the world bank predicts that russia's population is declining towards about 120 million people .PERIOD and there is another thing that you don't see on this map :COLON stalin ,COMMA khrushchev and other soviet leaders forced russians out to the far east to be in gulags labor camps .PERIOD nuclear cities .PERIOD whatever the case was as a result in the russian far east today ,COMMA which is twice the size of india .PERIOD you have exactly six million russians ,COMMA because globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to undermine and change the way we think about political geography .PERIOD remember ,COMMA the 40 dots on the nighttime map that show the hubs of the global economy .PERIOD and now many of you have been reading in the news .PERIOD how people are looking to china to lead the rebound ,COMMA the economic rebound ,COMMA not just in asia ,COMMA but potentially for the world .PERIOD so china is becoming the anchor of the economy in the region .PERIOD china has signed military agreements with many countries ,COMMA in the region ,COMMA all of this is happening without firing a shot .PERIOD so what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world ?QUESTIONMARK what i want to present to you is what i call state building day by day .PERIOD the kurds for 3000 years ,COMMA have been waging a struggle for independence .PERIOD and now is their chance to finally have it .PERIOD now remember kurdistan is landlocked .PERIOD and therefore it has to have amicable relations with them .PERIOD the lesson from kurdistan and from palestine ,COMMA is that independence alone without infrastructure is futile .PERIOD the last time that was the case was actually a century ago during the ottoman empire .PERIOD but today ,COMMA the hejaz railway lies in tatters ruins more .PERIOD pipelines means more silk roads .PERIOD instead of the great game in 2004 15 new countries ,COMMA joined the eu ,COMMA even if these regions aren't part of the eu ,COMMA they are becoming part of its sphere of influence .PERIOD so ,COMMA what's next ,COMMA where are we going to see borders change and new countries born ?QUESTIONMARK if we were to look at all of africa ,COMMA we could most certainly acknowledge far more ,COMMA tribal divisions and so forth .PERIOD it has three ongoing civil wars ,COMMA the genocide in darfur ,COMMA which you all know about the civil war in the east of the country and south sudan .PERIOD but if you look in nature ,COMMA you see that different kinds of animals can have really different lifespans .PERIOD now ,COMMA these animals are different from one another because they have different genes .PERIOD and we didn't study any of these animals is it miserable ?QUESTIONMARK it doesn't seem to be .PERIOD and if you look at the tissues of the animal ,COMMA they're starting to deteriorate .PERIOD and now here is the daf-2 mutant ,COMMA but it's really more like this .PERIOD let's say you're a 30 year-old guy -- or in your 30s -- ,COMMA and you're a bachelor .PERIOD and you're dating people .PERIOD she says ,COMMA i'm 60 .PERIOD well ,COMMA as you know genes ,COMMA which are part of the dna ,COMMA they're instructions to make a protein that does something it says that aging is subject to control by the genes ,COMMA and specifically by hormones .PERIOD so ,COMMA after we made our discoveries with little c elegans ,COMMA people who worked on other kinds of animals started asking ,COMMA if we made the same daf-2 mutation ,COMMA the hormone receptor mutation in other animals ,COMMA will they live longer ?QUESTIONMARK they hardly get cancer .PERIOD and when they do ,COMMA it's not as severe .PERIOD so in a daf-2 mutant -- ,COMMA you see that i have the x drawn here through the receptor .PERIOD the receptor isn't working as well and many of these different genes .PERIOD we've shown actually contribute to the long lifespan of the daf-2 mutant ,COMMA then they promote the uptake of nutrients .PERIOD so he doesn't actually do anything himself .PERIOD we don't know the details of how this works .PERIOD but we do know then that foxo genes can impact the lifespan of people .PERIOD but in this case ,COMMA there's already a drug called rapamycin that binds to the tor protein and inhibits its activity .PERIOD so people take it to prevent organ transplants from being rejected .PERIOD you could change the genes in principle .PERIOD so it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully to get the benefits without getting any problems .PERIOD i wasn't suggesting that i was going to go and do it ,COMMA but just move to one side for us if you would .PERIOD and when you look at these 70 year-old turtles ,COMMA you can't tell the difference just by looking between ,COMMA those turtles and 20 year-old turtles .PERIOD they're more resistant to these kinds of stresses .PERIOD they're not getting old in the dog's lifespan .PERIOD here's another good article about a new campaign ,COMMA opposing privatization of transit without any contact information for the campaign .PERIOD the message seems to be that the readers are most likely to want to eat maybe read a book ,COMMA maybe see a movie ,COMMA but not be engaged in their community .PERIOD they all have heroes who were chosen .PERIOD this helps me understand why a lot of people have trouble seeing themselves as leaders ,COMMA because it sends all the wrong messages about what leadership is about as long as we're teaching our kids that heroism starts when someone scratches a mark on your forehead ,COMMA or someone tells you that you're part of a prophecy .PERIOD they're missing the most important characteristic of leadership ,COMMA which is that it comes from within ,COMMA which leads us to the last one ,COMMA which is our elections .PERIOD so i was privileged to train in transplantation ,COMMA under two great surgical pioneers ,COMMA thomas starzl ,COMMA who performed the world's first successful liver transplant in 1967 and sir roy calne ,COMMA who performed the first liver transplant in the uk in the following year .PERIOD but not all patients on the transplant wait list are so fortunate .PERIOD and the gift of life has been extended from brain-dead donors to living related donors ,COMMA -- relatives ,COMMA who might donate an organ or a part of an organ like a split liver graft to a relative or loved one .PERIOD no doubt :COLON i was informed .PERIOD the consent had been obtained .PERIOD and at that time ,COMMA stem cell research had gained momentum ,COMMA following the isolation of the world's first human embryonic stem cells in the 1990s .PERIOD and as it turns out ,COMMA fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells .PERIOD if this research is successful ,COMMA it may then reduce the need to research and sacrifice human embryos .PERIOD it is a fact that when our organs or tissues are injured ,COMMA our bone marrow ,COMMA releases stem cells into our circulation .PERIOD there are 170 clinical trials investigating the role of stem cells in heart disease .PERIOD we are very happy because we have the opportunity to have this angel in the world -- ,COMMA not only in our country venezuela ,COMMA but in our world ,COMMA he has given us the possibility to have dreams ,COMMA and to make true the dreams .PERIOD and here are the results of this wonderful project that is the system in venezuela .PERIOD he buys a ring .PERIOD she buys a dress .PERIOD these optimistic young bastards promise to honor and cherish each other through hot flashes and mid-life crises ,COMMA and a cumulative 50-lb weight gain until that far-off day ,COMMA when one of them is finally able to rest in peace .PERIOD and some of them will even still be enjoying each others' company when neither of them can chew solid food anymore ,COMMA what do the folks who make it all the way to side-by-side burial plots have in common ?QUESTIONMARK and they try to pinpoint what it is that sets them apart from their miserable ,COMMA neighbors and friends .PERIOD it's obvious that this leads to marital bliss because women we care a great deal about being thin and good looking ,COMMA whereas men mostly care about sex .PERIOD so instead of all that laborious dieting and exercising ,COMMA we just need to wait for them to get fat ,COMMA maybe bake a few pies .PERIOD these are couples who can find good in any situation .PERIOD this is an actual study and let me clarify .PERIOD now .PERIOD i don't know how old all of you are .PERIOD but when i was a kid ,COMMA your parents took pictures with a special kind of camera that held something called film .PERIOD and by god ,COMMA film was expensive .PERIOD i'm serious .PERIOD so i'm obviously going to need fatten him up .PERIOD i have a doppelganger .PERIOD that's exactly what i do -- optical mind control .PERIOD even if we could measure what every cell is doing at all times ,COMMA we would still have to make sense of the recorded activity patterns .PERIOD and that's so difficult chances are we'll understand these patterns just as little as the brains that produce them to make progress .PERIOD we need to break the code .PERIOD the approach works so well that we can write purely artificial messages directly to the brain .PERIOD these headless bodies can live for about a day ,COMMA but they don't do much now for an intelligent being like our fly .PERIOD this policy is not written in stone ,COMMA but rather changes as the animal learns from experience .PERIOD so we bred flies whose brains were more or less randomly peppered with cells that were light addressable .PERIOD whenever it comes up to the midpoint ,COMMA it pauses .PERIOD it carefully scans the odor interface as if it was sniffing out its environment .PERIOD and then it turns around these 12 cells as shown here in green ,COMMA send the output to a brain structure called the mushroom body ,COMMA which is shown here in gray .PERIOD if the connection is strong ,COMMA the motors will turn on .PERIOD and the fly will initiate a turn in a situation like this .PERIOD we would expect the critic to speak up and to tell the actor to change its policy .PERIOD so the next time ,COMMA the fly finds itself facing the same odor .PERIOD again .PERIOD the connection is strong enough to turn on the motors and to trigger an evasive maneuver .PERIOD now ,COMMA in terms of biomimetics as human technologies ,COMMA take on more of the characteristics of nature ,COMMA nature becomes a much more useful teacher .PERIOD now ,COMMA being a biologist ,COMMA i was very curious about this .PERIOD these are gecko toes .PERIOD and the individual has 2 billion of these nano-size split ends .PERIOD so what they did was they asked us an important question .PERIOD they're climbing up a wall or a tree .PERIOD now ,COMMA that's real time .PERIOD you can't see anything .PERIOD so they do it with this active tail as they swing around .PERIOD okay ,COMMA there it goes .PERIOD it oscillates its tail up and down like a dolphin .PERIOD but watch its front legs .PERIOD can you see what they are doing ?QUESTIONMARK so now we were really confused because there are no reports of it gliding .PERIOD one of the problems is coming up with the right target .PERIOD there's not a lot of science behind that one either .PERIOD now ,COMMA why is this so complicated volcanoes ,COMMA eject aerosols into the atmosphere ?QUESTIONMARK so here's the thing .PERIOD it sounds like a simple question .PERIOD that's the ross sea ice shelf on the right there .PERIOD you can go then and study corals and figure out how often do you see this ?QUESTIONMARK and it been growing for about 600 years ,COMMA you can see some of the coral cores there on the right that the place where during an earthquake in 1954 .PERIOD this marine terrace was lifted up out of the ocean very quickly .PERIOD and it was lifted up about six to seven meters .PERIOD and so now you can walk through a coral reef without getting wet .PERIOD there's a whole family of curves here ,COMMA some of the records show lower temperatures than others .PERIOD and there is natural variability caused by the sun caused by el ninos .PERIOD there's consequences for carbonate organisms .PERIOD the main framework material of coral reefs is calcium carbonate and on coral reefs ,COMMA where some of the main framework organisms disappear .PERIOD we will see a major loss of marine biodiversity .PERIOD you know ,COMMA these are things that we have good physiological reasons to expect to see stressed caused by this transience .PERIOD you have to go back about 30 million years to find a time when co2 levels were double ,COMMA what they are today .PERIOD that's the reason that they're not able to respond or adapt to this rapid acidification that's going on right now .PERIOD and i think that may very well be true .PERIOD so i'll close with this and a long time ago ,COMMA -- well ,COMMA about 40 years ago ,COMMA -- my mom had an exchange student .PERIOD this is donna at the statue of liberty .PERIOD but i'd like to talk about another way to travel that doesn't require a ship or an airplane ,COMMA and just requires a movie camera ,COMMA a projector and a screen .PERIOD and that's what i'm going to talk to you about today .PERIOD so i'm the living product of two cultures coming together to change the arab nightmare into the american dream .PERIOD josh rushing the night they showed the pows and the dead soldiers ,COMMA -- ,COMMA al jazeera showed them -- .PERIOD it was powerful because america doesn't show those kinds of images .PERIOD and it upset me on a profound level that i wasn't bothered as much the night before jehane noujaim .PERIOD i was overwhelmed by the response of the film for we didn't know whether it would be able to get out there .PERIOD and i saw this with audiences .PERIOD man :COLON god forbid ,COMMA if you were not abu azzam's daughter in this life ,COMMA we're dead anyway .PERIOD woman .PERIOD perhaps we have to turn it into a moral war .PERIOD zvika :COLON i said ,COMMA ok ,COMMA that's bat-chen .PERIOD that's my daughter .PERIOD are you sure she is dead when we got to here ?QUESTIONMARK we saw three israeli military jeeps parked on the side of the road george .PERIOD but there is a teacher that is in charge .PERIOD but after thinking ,COMMA logically about it ,COMMA i didn't find any reason why not to meet them and let them know of our suffering .PERIOD we see that there are palestinians who suffered a lot who lost children ,COMMA and still believe in the peace process and in reconciliation .PERIOD yes ,COMMA yes .PERIOD but i've been trying to think about ways to give power to these independent voices to give power to the filmmakers to give power to people who are trying to use film for change .PERIOD there's just vision that are working with palestinians and israelis who are working together for peace ,COMMA and documenting that process and getting interviews out there .PERIOD and using this film to take to congress to show that it's a powerful tool to show that .PERIOD this is a woman who's had her daughter killed in an attack .PERIOD and she believes that there are peaceful ways to solve this .PERIOD there's working films and there's current tv ,COMMA which is an incredible platform for people around the world to be able to put their -- .PERIOD yes ,COMMA it's amazing .PERIOD there are people that want to be a part of this global day of film to be able to provide a platform for independent voices and independent films to get out there in the year 1919 ,COMMA a virtually unknown german mathematician named theodor ,COMMA kaluza suggested a very bold ,COMMA and in some ways ,COMMA a very bizarre idea .PERIOD that is ,COMMA in addition to left right back forth and up down .PERIOD kaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space that for some reason we don't yet see ,COMMA how is it that the sun 93 million miles away [that] ?QUESTIONMARK somehow ,COMMA it affects the motion of the earth .PERIOD he like einstein was in search of what we call a unified theory .PERIOD maybe i can play the same game with the other known force ,COMMA which was at that time known as the electromagnetic force -- ,COMMA we know of others today .PERIOD but at that time ,COMMA that was the only other one people were thinking about now .PERIOD but for those of us ,COMMA who are a little bit more practically minded ,COMMA two questions immediately arise from his observation .PERIOD it's very hard to see it though from far away .PERIOD so many people worked on it ,COMMA but by the '40s ,COMMA certainly by the '50s ,COMMA this strange ,COMMA but very compelling idea of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away in our era ,COMMA a new approach to unify .PERIOD the laws of physics is being pursued by physicists ,COMMA such as myself ,COMMA many others around the world .PERIOD it's called superstring theory as you were indicating .PERIOD and there ,COMMA you see unification because matter particles .PERIOD electrons and quarks ,COMMA radiation particles .PERIOD photons ,COMMA gravitons are all built up from one entity ,COMMA one of the other predictions of string theory .PERIOD -- .PERIOD no ,COMMA that's not one of the other predictions of string theory .PERIOD and that question is this when we look around the world as scientists have done for the last hundred years ,COMMA there appear to be about 20 numbers that really describe our universe ,COMMA not yet .PERIOD but we believe the answer for why those numbers have the values they do may rely on the form of the extra dimensions .PERIOD this is an example of something known as a calabi-yau shape .PERIOD -- name isn't all that important .PERIOD but as you can see the extra dimensions ,COMMA fold in on themselves and intertwine in a very interesting shape ,COMMA interesting structure .PERIOD and the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like ,COMMA then the microscopic landscape of our universe ,COMMA all around us would look like this on the tiniest of scales .PERIOD and this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime .PERIOD and yet ,COMMA even at this ,COMMA most fundamental level context is everything .PERIOD and now you see it .PERIOD there is no a priori reason .PERIOD why an h has to go between that w and a .PERIOD so you don't do it again .PERIOD your brain is learning .PERIOD and it's learning that the right side of its visual field is under red illumination .PERIOD the left side of its visual field is under green illumination .PERIOD i take it from your response .PERIOD they don't look the same anymore ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK why ?QUESTIONMARK because if the tile in that shadow were ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA in shadow and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye ,COMMA as the one outside the shadow ,COMMA it would have to be more reflective -- ,COMMA just the laws of physics ,COMMA which means we can bring all this information together to create some incredibly strong illusions .PERIOD and they land on the flower .PERIOD they stick their tongue in there called a proboscis ,COMMA and they drink sugar water .PERIOD so they are using the relationships between the colors to solve the puzzle ,COMMA which is exactly what we do .PERIOD so illusions are often used ,COMMA especially in art .PERIOD in the words of a more contemporary artist to demonstrate the fragility of our senses .PERIOD instead color tells us something completely different that the brain didn't actually evolve to see the world the way it is .PERIOD we can't instead the brain evolved to see the world ,COMMA the way it was useful to see in the past .PERIOD well ,COMMA one of the ways we do in my lab and studio is we translate the light into sound ,COMMA and we enable people to hear their visual world .PERIOD so working with kids ,COMMA they created images thinking about what might the images you see sound like if we could listen to them .PERIOD so now ,COMMA what i want to do ,COMMA i'm going to put the middle nine surfaces here under yellow illumination ,COMMA by simply putting a filter behind them .PERIOD the question is ,COMMA is that an illusion and they're different ,COMMA and you can make your own decision .PERIOD and then you'll decide whether the invasion was worth it .PERIOD that's how you think about security -- in terms of the trade-off .PERIOD i'll give you the short answer now .PERIOD most of the time that works ,COMMA we've developed this ability because it makes evolutionary sense .PERIOD the unknown is perceived to be riskier than the familiar .PERIOD if you hear a lot about tiger attacks ,COMMA there must be a lot of tigers around when something is so common .PERIOD it's no longer news .PERIOD -- car crashes domestic violence ,COMMA -- .PERIOD those are the risks you worry about .PERIOD there's no real word for stuff that makes us secure ,COMMA but doesn't make us feel secure .PERIOD and there are two ways to do this enough .PERIOD real world examples helps security theater's exposed when it's obvious that it's not working properly .PERIOD if for example ,COMMA terrorism almost never happens .PERIOD it's really hard to judge the efficacy of counter-terrorist measures .PERIOD it doesn't change .PERIOD it's real .PERIOD we couldn't have a germ theory of disease before we invented the microscope to see them .PERIOD where do we get these models ?QUESTIONMARK we get them from others .PERIOD think of models of terrorism ,COMMA child ,COMMA kidnapping airline safety car .PERIOD safety models can come from industry for us .PERIOD we're very facile around electricity .PERIOD now ,COMMA it had a name which made it scarier than the regular flu .PERIOD even though it was more deadly as the novelty wore off .PERIOD the months went by .PERIOD there was some amount of tolerance .PERIOD people got used to it .PERIOD we have feeling model reality .PERIOD new models that extend long periods of time are hard .PERIOD global warming is a great example .PERIOD strong feelings can create a model .PERIOD and that's okay .PERIOD now ,COMMA what we want is people to get familiar enough with better models ,COMMA -- have it reflected in their feelings ,COMMA -- to allow them to make security trade-offs .PERIOD remember ,COMMA i said feeling model reality .PERIOD i said ,COMMA reality doesn't change it actually does someone else bought it and died all human life .PERIOD all life depends on plants and plants .PERIOD sometimes find it rather difficult to move because there might be cities and other things in the way .PERIOD so if all human life depends on plants ,COMMA doesn't it make sense that perhaps we should try to save them .PERIOD all the genetic information for future generations of plants are held in seeds .PERIOD so all around the world people are doing the same thing .PERIOD this is at least 100 times bigger .PERIOD how much does it cost ?QUESTIONMARK the future research is ,COMMA how can we find the genetic and molecular markers for the viability of seeds without having to plant them every 10 years ?QUESTIONMARK and it was found close to here .PERIOD stanford .PERIOD some lasted 14-and-a-half minutes .PERIOD couldn't do it could not wait ,COMMA put it back .PERIOD they would walk around .PERIOD they would play with their skirts and pants .PERIOD the sales person that -- the customer says ,COMMA i want that .PERIOD and the person says ,COMMA okay ,COMMA here you are .PERIOD then you sell a lot more the rules of engagement ,COMMA how to talk when to talk and how to deal with them .PERIOD we just have to persevere .PERIOD everybody seems to agree with that .PERIOD but now ,COMMA as we prepare to talk ,COMMA we understand how little we know should we talk to hamas now ,COMMA my diplomats are instructed to talk to all these groups ,COMMA but talking can be done in different ways .PERIOD we make a distinction between talking from a diplomatic level and talking at the political level ,COMMA in his memoirs ,COMMA long road to freedom .PERIOD he wrote that he survived during those years of captivity ,COMMA because he always decided to look upon his oppressor as also being a human being ,COMMA also being a human being .PERIOD now ,COMMA south african friends will know that was very painful dialogue is not easy -- ,COMMA not between individuals ,COMMA not between groups ,COMMA not between governments -- ,COMMA but it is very necessary .PERIOD but that strategy seldom takes you very far .PERIOD we could never have done the convention against anti-personnel landmines .PERIOD and the convention that is banning cluster munitions ,COMMA unless we had done diplomacy differently by engaging with civil society .PERIOD how are we going to solve climate change through negotiations ?QUESTIONMARK unless we are able to make civil society and people not part of the problem .PERIOD but part of the solution ,COMMA what is the legitimacy of diplomacy of the the solution we devise as diplomats ,COMMA if they cannot be reflected and understood by also ,COMMA these broader forces of societies that we now very loosely call groups .PERIOD the diplomatic toolbox is actually full of different tools .PERIOD we can use to strengthen our communication in my country .PERIOD i have seen how the council of islamist groups and christian groups came together ,COMMA not as a government initiative ,COMMA but they came together on their own initiative to establish contact and dialogue in times ,COMMA where things were pretty low-key tension .PERIOD how are we going to settle and build a bigger ?QUESTIONMARK we to deal with our issues if we don't improve our skills of communication .PERIOD so i'm in chile in the atacama desert ,COMMA sitting in a hotel lobby ,COMMA because that's the only place that i can get a wi-fi connection .PERIOD and i have this picture up on my screen .PERIOD and a woman comes up behind me .PERIOD and you know ,COMMA excuse me .PERIOD this is a gentoo penguin ,COMMA and she was still skeptical .PERIOD so one of the things that i love to do is travel around the world and look at archaeological sites .PERIOD and one thing that isn't a mystery actually was when i grew up -- ,COMMA because when i was a little kid ,COMMA i'd seen these pictures -- .PERIOD and i thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA why that look on the face ?QUESTIONMARK in fact ,COMMA in many of the statues ,COMMA when you excavate them ,COMMA the backs are totally smooth ,COMMA -- ,COMMA almost glass smooth .PERIOD we're trying to get all of the permissions to get everything all set to get it going .PERIOD in this case ,COMMA we're working with a major medical foundation to develop inexpensive ways of diagnosing diseases .PERIOD in developing countries ,COMMA various parts of the world will have a cult food that people get enormously attached to -- .PERIOD there's tremendous traditions ,COMMA there's secrecy ,COMMA and i'm trying to use a very scientific approach .PERIOD so i do a lot of work on dinosaurs ,COMMA not the same one .PERIOD actually ,COMMA this is a cast which i had bought .PERIOD and then after buying the cast ,COMMA i found my own and i don't have room for two .PERIOD it's something that can inform all sorts of science in unexpected ways .PERIOD these days bits are cheap .PERIOD unfortunately ,COMMA that means you've got to spend more time sorting through them .PERIOD then a little bit later .PERIOD i start getting some pictures like this .PERIOD that's kind of what it's like .PERIOD and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA when i was at microsoft ,COMMA that was so engrossing ,COMMA and the whole industry was expanding so much that it did tend to crowd out most of the other things in my life .PERIOD the sound made flicking a wall switch off is of a completely different nature ,COMMA or the recorded crowing of a rooster .PERIOD that's the end of that take-out sandwich shops ,COMMA film processing drop-offs peep-shows and necktie stores .PERIOD you were late for school again .PERIOD this morning ,COMMA we have fading memories of that provisional temple erected each time ,COMMA an adult sat down .PERIOD the next story is called the haverpiece collection ,COMMA a nondescript warehouse ,COMMA visible for a moment from the northbound lanes of the prykushko expressway serves as the temporary resting place for the haverpiece collection of european dried fruit .PERIOD do you remember wandering as a child through those dark wooden storefront galleries a shoe made of apricot leather for the daughter of a czar ,COMMA and that this ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA will be the way that we treat cancer in the future .PERIOD it is very useful in certain circumstances .PERIOD it's the one theory that the biologists ever really got right ,COMMA you predict a black hole .PERIOD and you look out the telescope and there it is just like ,COMMA you said ,COMMA and so we can discover things that probably you could have found by looking at enough of your relatives ,COMMA but they may be surprising and applied minds gets a lot of calls from people who want help with their problems .PERIOD and i didn't think this was a very likely one to call back .PERIOD so i kept on giving him to the delay list .PERIOD and i'll show you what that protein measurement looks like .PERIOD we sort out the proteins -- from left to right ,COMMA is the weight of the fragments that we're getting .PERIOD and from top to bottom is how slippery they are .PERIOD and you can see how the lines occur in these little groups of bump bump bump bump bump .PERIOD and many people in this audience probably wouldn't be alive .PERIOD if doctors didn't do this .PERIOD well ,COMMA it's in the kitchen ,COMMA oh ,COMMA you must have kitchen water .PERIOD so your house is dealing with leaks all the time ,COMMA but it's fixing them .PERIOD it's draining them out and so on .PERIOD and so i gave this talk and said ,COMMA why don't you guys do this ?QUESTIONMARK but design a program of treatments specifically for you and help your body guide back to health -- guide your body back to health .PERIOD so thank you very much .PERIOD now ,COMMA i want to tell you a quick story super bowl .PERIOD i heard it over here .PERIOD it was the date of the super bowl ,COMMA and there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way .PERIOD but when we talked to people ,COMMA it appeared that a funnel effect had happened in these tribes all across the united states ,COMMA but not just work .PERIOD it's within these tribes that societies get built .PERIOD that important things happen .PERIOD if you focus in on a group ,COMMA like this -- ,COMMA this happens to be a usc game -- .PERIOD and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras and do magnification factors ,COMMA so you could see individual people .PERIOD you would ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA see not a single crowd .PERIOD just like there is not a single crowd here ,COMMA but you would see these tribes that are then coming together .PERIOD not all tribes are the same .PERIOD and what makes the difference is the culture .PERIOD this is the kid who shot up virginia tech .PERIOD so this other book that steve mentioned ,COMMA that just came out called the three laws of performance ,COMMA my colleague ,COMMA steve zaffron ,COMMA and i argue that as people see the world .PERIOD so they behave .PERIOD well ,COMMA if people see the world in such a way that life sucks ,COMMA then their behavior will follow automatically from that .PERIOD now my birthday is coming up shortly and my driver's license ,COMMA expires ,COMMA the amount of world-changing behavior that would happen a whole group of people communicating that way talking that way .PERIOD now we find these in places where really smart successful people show up .PERIOD it was not christmas time .PERIOD there was a christmas tree .PERIOD there is ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA another stage .PERIOD there was no road map .PERIOD no one had ever done anything like this before .PERIOD and people at the time feared that south africa would end up going the way that rwanda has gone descending into one skirmish after another in a civil war ,COMMA that seems to have no end .PERIOD what about martin luther king ?QUESTIONMARK in fact ,COMMA martin luther king's .PERIOD most famous line was at stage three 48 percent of working tribes ,COMMA say ,COMMA these are employed tribes ,COMMA say ,COMMA i'm great ,COMMA and you're not ,COMMA but you don't leave them where you found them .PERIOD okay ,COMMA i don't know anybody .PERIOD we move people from stage one to stage two by getting them in a new tribe ,COMMA and then over time ,COMMA getting them connected ,COMMA but we're not done yet .PERIOD because then how do we go from stage four ,COMMA which is great to stage five ?QUESTIONMARK incidentally ,COMMA they did pull it off .PERIOD and they released the first-ever world poll .PERIOD we're here to celebrate compassion .PERIOD but kindness is an everyday byproduct of all the great virtues .PERIOD and in that light for the religious compassion ,COMMA also brings us into the territory of mystery -- encouraging us ,COMMA not just to see beauty .PERIOD but perhaps also to look for the face of god ,COMMA in the moment of suffering in the face of a stranger ,COMMA in the face of the vibrant religious other the communities that jean vanier founded like jean vanier himself ,COMMA exude tenderness .PERIOD and compassion can also have those qualities .PERIOD and compassion is unleashed in wider and wider circles by signs and stories never by statistics and strategies .PERIOD rachel naomi remen says ,COMMA this is an important and empowering story for our time .PERIOD because this story insists that each and every one of us frail and flawed ,COMMA as we may be inadequate ,COMMA as we may ,COMMA feel has exactly what's needed to help repair the part of the world that we can see and touch .PERIOD this is going to change science .PERIOD i believe and it will change religion .PERIOD einstein believed deeply that science should transcend national and ethnic divisions .PERIOD but he watched physicists and chemists become the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction in the early 20th century .PERIOD so in this photograph ,COMMA you see a mind looking out a window at what might be a cathedral -- .PERIOD it's not .PERIOD thank you camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol .PERIOD and it went like this r-o-w-d-i-e .PERIOD that's the way we spell rowdie .PERIOD and i just waited for the time that i could go off and read my books .PERIOD and i was always going off to crowded bars when i really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends .PERIOD so even if you're an extrovert yourself ,COMMA i'm talking about your coworkers and your spouses and your children and the person sitting next to you right now ,COMMA -- all of them subject to this bias that is pretty deep .PERIOD and real in our society ,COMMA shyness is about fear of social judgment .PERIOD so the key then to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in the zone of stimulation .PERIOD that is right for us .PERIOD and also ,COMMA we have this belief system right now that i call the new groupthink ,COMMA which holds that all creativity .PERIOD and all productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place .PERIOD and the vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert ,COMMA as opposed to an introvert ,COMMA even though introverts actually get better grades and are more knowledgeable according to research .PERIOD now ,COMMA i think at this point ,COMMA it's important for me to say that i actually love extroverts the same religions ,COMMA who send their sages off to lonely .PERIOD mountain tops ,COMMA also teach us love and trust .PERIOD here's margaret atwood cat's eye .PERIOD but here's the thing about my grandfather .PERIOD it was my version of my grandfather's hours of the day alone in his library .PERIOD and i call this my year of speaking dangerously ,COMMA but we need much more privacy and much more freedom and much more autonomy at work .PERIOD we need to be teaching kids to work together for sure ,COMMA but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own .PERIOD and that's okay .PERIOD then about the initiative that chris mentioned that we decided to launch at amd that we call 50x15 .PERIOD he explained to me about johann strauss and how he created the waltzes that became so famous in the world .PERIOD that's year by year .PERIOD this comes from our friends at gapmindercom .PERIOD so we talked about ways in which perhaps one could partner to be able to bring the cost of this technology down and ,COMMA frankly ,COMMA -- .PERIOD and i know that sometimes i offend some of my customers ,COMMA when i say this ,COMMA but i truly mean it -- ,COMMA if you could take the name of the computer off the top of it ,COMMA it would be very difficult to judge who made it because they're all highly commoditized ,COMMA but they're all different .PERIOD and the last piece ,COMMA which is really important -- .PERIOD and this is an opinion that we have not shared by many .PERIOD this is one where we seem to stand alone on this .PERIOD one -- is that we really believe that the greatest success of this initiative can come by fostering local ,COMMA integrated end-to-end ecosystems .PERIOD we just recently opened a learning laboratory in a school in the west cape in south africa in a school .PERIOD that's called nelson mandela school .PERIOD and when you see the faces and activities of these children being able to access computers ,COMMA it's just phenomenal .PERIOD and we're really thrilled about the opportunity to be part of this and can't wait to see what comes out of this exciting exciting activity .PERIOD i'll tell you that one of the things that i feel is really critical for us in industry in business is to be able to be passionate about solving these problems .PERIOD i was eager to go off to college and go find girls and study and girls and study .PERIOD but then i finished college ,COMMA and i fell in love .PERIOD and on my wedding day ,COMMA my father came to me again and said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i'm going to remind you again that each generation has to do better than the last one just existing .PERIOD i really think .PERIOD that's there's this inner desire .PERIOD and all of a sudden it brought a lot of money and a lot of attention that's kind of a no-brainer .PERIOD so what is it for ?QUESTIONMARK so i believe ,COMMA essentially that leadership is stewardship .PERIOD this is not my planet .PERIOD it wasn't mine before .PERIOD i was born .PERIOD do you think we have a stewardship here to take the environment ?QUESTIONMARK seriously ?QUESTIONMARK what we believe obviously -- ?QUESTIONMARK and you know ,COMMA this -- determines our behavior and our behavior determines what we become in life ,COMMA my wife ,COMMA and i first made five decisions on what to do with the money .PERIOD we just said ,COMMA we're not going to use it on us .PERIOD believe me .PERIOD there's a whole lot easier ways to make money .PERIOD the last thing we did is we became what i call reverse tithers .PERIOD and that is when my wife and i got married 30 years ago ,COMMA we started tithing .PERIOD materialism is all about getting -- .PERIOD get get get get all .PERIOD you can can all you

,COMMA but he doesn't do miracles .PERIOD just to show off what do you do with a shepherd's staff ,COMMA you pull them ,COMMA or you poke them one or the other ,COMMA and it represents your influence

?QUESTIONMARK and in some countries ,COMMA -- ,COMMA let me pick afghanistan -- 75 percent of the little girls don't go to school .PERIOD so in the three years ,COMMA since i talked at ted and showed a prototype ,COMMA it's gone from an idea to a real laptop .PERIOD we have about a quarter of a million in transit to those and other children .PERIOD and then there are another quarter of a million more that are being ordered at this moment .PERIOD and that engine is going to see the results in 20 years .PERIOD they own the laptops .PERIOD they take them home .PERIOD and the reason she brought

.PERIOD this is not mine by the way .PERIOD we learn these really bad lessons really well ,COMMA when the vice president for health care quality at beth israel spoke about this incident ,COMMA he said

this one thing was going to happen ,COMMA and something else happened instead' .PERIOD and the thing is says ,COMMA ira glass .PERIOD we need this ,COMMA but you know ,COMMA our stories are like this ,COMMA because our lives are like this .PERIOD and something else happened instead because half the stuff that's the most mind-boggling and world-altering -- ted ,COMMA 1998 ,COMMA -- ,COMMA eh ,COMMA we come up with another idea .PERIOD bioenergy isn't global warming .PERIOD bioenergy is something which seems counterintuitive .PERIOD bioenergy is oil .PERIOD it's gas .PERIOD it's coal and part of building that bridge to the future to the point where we can actually see the oceans in a rational way ,COMMA or put up these geo-spatial orbits that will twirl or do microwaves ,COMMA or stuff is going to depend on how we understand bioenergy and manage it .PERIOD and to do that ,COMMA you really have to look first at agriculture .PERIOD maybe that's one of the reasons why if you fly over west ,COMMA texas ,COMMA the types of wells that you're beginning to see don't look unlike those pictures of kansas and those irrigated plots ,COMMA which is curious as we debate all this stuff .PERIOD but as you think of coal ,COMMA this is what burned wheat kernels .PERIOD look like not entirely unlike coal .PERIOD that is what bioenergy is .PERIOD it is not ethanol .PERIOD it is not subsidies to a few companies .PERIOD it is not importing corn into iowa because you've built so many of these ethanol plants .PERIOD it is beginning to understand the transition that occurred in agriculture from brute force into biological force .PERIOD and in the measure that you can do that ,COMMA you can clean some stuff ,COMMA and you can clean it pretty quickly .PERIOD but in the meantime ,COMMA for the next decade ,COMMA at least the name of the game is hydrocarbons and be that oil ,COMMA be that gas be that coal .PERIOD this is what we're dealing with .PERIOD and before i make this talk too long ,COMMA here's what's happening in the current energy system ,COMMA 86 percent of the energy .PERIOD we consume are hydrocarbons .PERIOD that means 86 percent of the stuff .PERIOD we're consuming are probably processed plants and amoebas and the rest of the stuff .PERIOD and there's a role in here for conservation .PERIOD there's a role in here for alternative stuff .PERIOD but we've also got to get that other portion ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK and what gave her inspiration ?QUESTIONMARK and meaning was the fact that she was taking care of people who were far away from home in the wake of the dotcom crash and 9/11 san francisco bay area .PERIOD hotels went through the largest percentage revenue drop in the history of american hotels .PERIOD and i initially ended up in the business section of the bookstore looking for a business solution .PERIOD each of us no matter what our role is in business has some hierarchy of needs in the workplace .PERIOD so ,COMMA as i started reading more maslow ,COMMA what i started to realize is that maslow later in his life wanted to take this hierarchy for the individual and apply it to the collective to organizations and specifically to business .PERIOD but as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressing ,COMMA the higher needs of our employees and our customers ,COMMA i realized we had no metrics .PERIOD so i went out and studied a bunch of things .PERIOD and i found a survey that showed that 94 percent of business leaders worldwide believe that the intangibles are important in their business things like intellectual property ,COMMA their corporate culture ,COMMA their brand loyalty .PERIOD and yet ,COMMA only five percent of those same leaders actually had a means of measuring the intangibles in their business .PERIOD and he's a very wise man .PERIOD and he said ,COMMA listen ,COMMA bhutan's goal is not to create happiness .PERIOD one of those key indicators is ,COMMA how do the bhutanese feel about how they spend their time each day ?QUESTIONMARK or in other words ,COMMA i think the bhutanese believe happiness equals wanting what you have -- .PERIOD imagine gratitude -- divided by having what you want -- gratification .PERIOD so it suggests that the momentum is shifting .PERIOD as you look at these two columns .PERIOD here .PERIOD doesn't it make you feel like it's time for us to start figuring out a new way to count a new way to imagine what's important to us in life .PERIOD we're spending 10 billion dollars on the census .PERIOD we're asking 10 simple questions -- .PERIOD it is simplicity .PERIOD they're about demographics abe maslow said ,COMMA long ago ,COMMA something you've heard before .PERIOD but you didn't realize it was him .PERIOD he said ,COMMA if the only tool you have is a hammer ,COMMA everything starts to look like a nail .PERIOD in vivian's case ,COMMA her unit of production isn't the tangible hours she works .PERIOD it's the intangible difference she makes during that one hour of work .PERIOD he stayed there a hundred times in the last 20 years ,COMMA and he's loyal to the property ,COMMA because of the relationship that vivian and her fellow employees have

.PERIOD and so we kind of have this kind of moral feel-good moment that bottle winds up getting burned .PERIOD and so poor people who are making these products in petrochemical centers like cancer alley ,COMMA poor people who are consuming these products disproportionately .PERIOD and then poor people who even at the tail end of the recycling are having their lives .PERIOD shortened are all

calls my particular volantor ,COMMA a skycar ,COMMA one could say that a helicopter does pretty much what the hummingbird does and gets around in much the same way .PERIOD and it's true .PERIOD but a helicopter is a very complex device ,COMMA because if you're in this world ,COMMA where computers are controlling what you're doing ,COMMA it's going to be very critical that something can't fail on you .PERIOD well ,COMMA you can't right now take off from your home because it's too noisy .PERIOD i mean to be able to take off from your home ,COMMA you'd have to be extremely quiet after all ,COMMA if you can fly like that ,COMMA why are you going to drive around on a highway ?QUESTIONMARK you can play computer games .PERIOD you can sleep .PERIOD you can read on the way .PERIOD and then through the various years ,COMMA we invented various vehicles redundancy is the critical issue here .PERIOD if you want to stay alive ,COMMA you've got to have backups .PERIOD that's a very significant incentive for getting out of san francisco .PERIOD but you better be the first one out of town as the real estate values ,COMMA go to hell .PERIOD there's an interesting poll that came out recently under nas -- .PERIOD i think it's msnbc -- in which they asked the question ,COMMA are you in the market for a volantor ?QUESTIONMARK i mean ,COMMA think about how much we love this .PERIOD think about that ,COMMA what dr soljacic figured out how to do was separate the coils in a transformer to a greater distance than the size of those transformers ,COMMA using this technology ,COMMA which is not dissimilar from the way ,COMMA an opera singer ,COMMA shatters a glass on the other side of the room .PERIOD and what i'm going to do is to show you pretty much what's here .PERIOD and if the demo

again .PERIOD just for safety's sake ,COMMA we're an equal opportunity designer of this sort of thing .PERIOD it runs the android operating system .PERIOD so we put a little sleeve on the back ,COMMA

you're cremated ,COMMA all those toxins ,COMMA i mentioned are released into the atmosphere ,COMMA so by trying to preserve our dead bodies ,COMMA we deny death poison the living and further harm the environment .PERIOD i realize this is not the kind of relationship that we usually aspire to have with our food ,COMMA the decompiculture society shares a vision of a cultural shift from our current culture of death ,COMMA denial and body preservation to one of decompiculture ,COMMA a radical acceptance of death and decomposition .PERIOD so the virtual earth initiative and other types of these initiatives are all about extending our current search metaphor .PERIOD well ,COMMA a little unknown secret is his brother actually works on the virtual earth team .PERIOD when we think about how all this comes together .PERIOD it's all about software algorithms and math .PERIOD we do this all through software algorithms and math -- ,COMMA a highly automated pipeline ,COMMA creating these cities .PERIOD but what we've found is they like the fluidity of the 3-d model .PERIOD i'm going to use these two countries to make an economic argument for democracy ,COMMA rather than against democracy .PERIOD look at the skyline of shanghai .PERIOD the picture on india is the dharavi slum of mumbai in india ,COMMA in an interview printed in the financial press of india .PERIOD he said that he wants

little known fact about the two countries .PERIOD the economy grows government accumulates more resources ,COMMA and the government can invest in infrastructure ,COMMA -- ,COMMA rather than infrastructure being a cause for economic growth .PERIOD one reason is the east asian model .PERIOD korea succeeded .PERIOD north korea .PERIOD didn't burma didn't succeed in china .PERIOD it's all women by looking at these two pictures .PERIOD i say ,COMMA no ,COMMA it won't overtake china for a while .PERIOD actually ,COMMA the answer is more nuanced and subtle than that .PERIOD indira gandhi declared emergency rule in 1975 .PERIOD why do many people believe that india is still a growth disaster ,COMMA but china is a superstar in terms of economic growth .PERIOD this is the grand cafe here in oxford .PERIOD that's its great claim to fame .PERIOD and i wanted to show it to you not because i want to give you the kind of starbucks tour of historic england .PERIOD but rather ,COMMA because the english coffeehouse was crucial to the development and spread of one of the great intellectual flowerings of the last 500 years ,COMMA what we now call the enlightenment .PERIOD what are the environments that lead to unusual levels of innovation ,COMMA unusual levels of creativity .PERIOD and this is what they ended up coming with .PERIOD it's called a neonurture device in the inside .PERIOD it's all car parts .PERIOD it's got a fan .PERIOD it's got headlights for warmth .PERIOD it's got door chimes for alarm -- .PERIOD it runs off a car battery .PERIOD this is hogarth's famous painting of a kind of political dinner at a tavern .PERIOD but this is what the coffee shops looked like back then .PERIOD and one of the problems with this is that people are actually -- .PERIOD when you research this field -- ,COMMA people are notoriously unreliable ,COMMA when they actually kind of self-report on where they have their own good ideas or their history of their best ideas .PERIOD so when they were sitting in front of the microscope ,COMMA when they were talking to their colleague at the water cooler and all these things ,COMMA but that's a key thing .PERIOD and so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues ,COMMA and everybody's like ,COMMA no ,COMMA i hadn't thought of doing that .PERIOD and so guier and weiffenbach go back to weiffenbach's office .PERIOD and they start kind of noodling around -- hacking as we might call it .PERIOD now ,COMMA we should record it ,COMMA and they thought about it .PERIOD and they said ,COMMA well ,COMMA i guess maybe you could .PERIOD let's run the numbers here .PERIOD and i bet you one of you ,COMMA if not more has used said device and said ,COMMA satellite system to locate a nearby coffeehouse somewhere in the last -- in the last day or last week ,COMMA right ,COMMA chance favors the connected mind .PERIOD my story starts way before i was born .PERIOD they got on and didn't know where they were going and ended up in canada .PERIOD i was 14 ,COMMA and i emailed professors at the local university to see if maybe i could go work in their lab ,COMMA and hardly anyone responded .PERIOD and so i thought ,COMMA maybe if it can promote cell growth ,COMMA it can inhibit cell death too .PERIOD and so that's the project that i pursued for that year .PERIOD and it's continuing now as well and found that a specific purine derivative called guanidine had inhibited the cell growth by approximately 60 percent .PERIOD but i'd heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time .PERIOD so how did the good and bad go together ?QUESTIONMARK and while i was doing this ,COMMA i was reading the cancer literature trying to -- again ,COMMA -- familiarize myself with this new medical field .PERIOD and it was really interesting -- .PERIOD there were articles correlating .PERIOD if you have a bone fracture and then bone cancer arises ,COMMA it hasn't yet become fine-tuned enough to finish what has been initiated if we eliminate cancer the way we're trying to do now with chemotherapy and radiation .PERIOD we're bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins ,COMMA or with radiation trying to kill it .PERIOD we're removing the cancer cells ,COMMA but we're revealing the previous damage that the body has tried to fix .PERIOD so this really changed my view of looking at cancer .PERIOD and what metastases are is when the tumor -- ,COMMA when a piece -- breaks off and travels through the blood stream and goes to a different organ .PERIOD that's what a metastasis is .PERIOD but then again ,COMMA this fact that the metastases didn't go to skeletal muscle made that seem unlikely .PERIOD and i guess i'll keep investigating until i get the answers .PERIOD is it possible that muscle ?QUESTIONMARK somehow intuitively knows that it needs this blood supply .PERIOD it needs to be constantly contracting .PERIOD so therefore it's almost selfish .PERIOD it's grabbing its blood vessels for itself .PERIOD and i hate to say that ,COMMA but it seems as though muscle cell ,COMMA possibly because of all its use has adapted faster than other body tissues to respond to injury to fine-tune .PERIOD this repair response .PERIOD and actually be able to finish the process ,COMMA which the body wants to finish .PERIOD i really believe that the human body is very ,COMMA very smart ,COMMA and we can't counteract something .PERIOD the body is saying to do .PERIOD and again ,COMMA some of these may be far-fetched ,COMMA but i figured ,COMMA if there's anywhere to present far-fetched ideas ,COMMA it's here at ted .PERIOD so thank you very much .PERIOD some of you have heard the story before ,COMMA but in fact ,COMMA there's somebody in the audience who's never heard this story -- in front of an audience -- before .PERIOD so i'm a little more nervous than i normally am telling this story ,COMMA and then my translator left .PERIOD they slept on the floor at night .PERIOD i had photographed ,COMMA as i said ,COMMA a lot of these kids again ,COMMA not at all shy ,COMMA or withdrawn ,COMMA or anything like the other children that i'd photographed it was very obvious from the very beginning that she was a leader .PERIOD and i said to my translator ,COMMA what's going on ?QUESTIONMARK why is she crying ?QUESTIONMARK and i said ,COMMA i'm 28 years old .PERIOD and i live in hotels ,COMMA and i'm not married ,COMMA and they had no idea about this request that she'd made of me .PERIOD so i finally found myung sung ,COMMA her best friend that she used to play with after school every day .PERIOD and i said to the translator ,COMMA what did he say ?QUESTIONMARK and i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA tell him that i am a photographer .PERIOD i sort of had this picture of this incredibly wonderful ,COMMA bright happy .PERIOD little child who now appeared to be very withdrawn being enslaved by this family .PERIOD so i finally decided i said ,COMMA look -- .PERIOD this is all through the translator ,COMMA because this is all ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i don't speak a word of korean -- .PERIOD and i said ,COMMA look ,COMMA i'm really glad that hyun-sook has a family to live with .PERIOD i don't pretend to understand what's going on here .PERIOD well ,COMMA there was an american marine priest that i had met in the course of doing the story who had 75 children living in his house .PERIOD he had kids from all over korea living there ,COMMA and he would find families for these kids hyun-sook stayed at father keene's and her uncle agreed to let her stay there until the adoption went through .PERIOD and then she set up a work detail list of who cleaned the orphanage on what day we went back to our hotel room .PERIOD and gene was showing natasha also where atlanta was .PERIOD and we fall asleep -- .PERIOD and i've been in this room ,COMMA you know ,COMMA for a couple of months now .PERIOD and they always overheat the hotels in korea terribly .PERIOD so during the day ,COMMA i always left the window open ,COMMA and i don't speak korean ,COMMA but i'm hearing these voices .PERIOD and i'm not hearing anger .PERIOD i'm hearing terror .PERIOD i remember his son had the ll bean bootlaces ,COMMA and we're trying to do up his laces .PERIOD so we ran to the bathroom and got towels and put them over our faces .PERIOD and the kids faces .PERIOD eleven people ended up dying in the fire .PERIOD five people jumped and died .PERIOD other people were killed by the smoke .PERIOD so it turned into a dual celebration ,COMMA because natasha was the first person from this village ever to go to the united states .PERIOD this is saying goodbye to everybody at the orphanage .PERIOD and the pilot ,COMMA jeff cowley actually went back and adopted one of the other kids at the orphanage after meeting natasha .PERIOD so at this point ,COMMA natasha doesn't speak a word of english other than what little father keene taught her .PERIOD she learned english in three months .PERIOD natasha told me that a lot of the kids thought she was stuck up because they would talk to her .PERIOD and she wouldn't answer .PERIOD and they didn't realize she didn't actually speak english very well in the beginning .PERIOD now remember the picture how much she looked like her grandmother at the beginning ,COMMA the captain of the cheerleaders .PERIOD this is her half-sister .PERIOD natasha would you just come up for a second ,COMMA just maybe to say ,COMMA hello to everybody natasha .PERIOD i've seen pictures millions of times .PERIOD but today was the first time i'm actually seeing him give the whole presentation .PERIOD i started crying .PERIOD the telescope is actually built similarly to the well-known to you hubble space telescope ,COMMA except it does have an additional lens -- .PERIOD a wide-field lens as you would call it as a photographer .PERIOD the way we do that actually is with a method which we call the transit method .PERIOD but we learn a lot from that not only that there is a planet there ,COMMA but we also learn its size .PERIOD so what have we learned ?QUESTIONMARK and we do care about planets like the earth ,COMMA because by now ,COMMA we understood that life as a chemical system really needs a smaller planet with water ,COMMA and with rocks ,COMMA and with a lot of complex chemistry to originate to emerge to survive .PERIOD so today i'm here to actually give you a first glimpse of what the new telescope kepler has been able to tell us in the last few weeks .PERIOD and lo and behold ,COMMA we are back to the harmony and to fulfilling the dreams of copernicus .PERIOD it's about 100 million such planets .PERIOD so that's great because then we can go and study them -- remotely ,COMMA of course ,COMMA -- with all the techniques that we already have tested in the past five years .PERIOD the one that this step is enabling us to do is coming next .PERIOD so the question is is that chemical phenomenon universal ,COMMA or is it something ,COMMA which depends on the planet ?QUESTIONMARK we don't want to go blind because there's too many possibilities .PERIOD and there is not too much lab .PERIOD and there is not enough human time to actually to do all the experiments .PERIOD well ,COMMA there are many reasons ,COMMA and you heard some of them in the short talk today .PERIOD and that is going to change our worldview in a profound way ,COMMA -- ,COMMA not in a dissimilar way as 400 years ago ,COMMA copernicus' act did by changing the way we view space and time and half the time .PERIOD what's happened is it's related .PERIOD this kind of sense of insignificance to humankind to the earth in a bigger space .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA look ,COMMA you can see the necktie ,COMMA but you can't even imagine seeing the size of a little small atom .PERIOD so what does this tell us there is immense powerful potential in life in this universe -- ,COMMA especially now that we know that places like the earth are common .PERIOD let's start this new revolution at the tail end of the old one with synthetic biology ,COMMA being the way to transform both our environment and our future .PERIOD these gapminder bubbles show you how the spread of the virus was in 1983 in the world ,COMMA or how we estimate that it was look india ,COMMA got many infected ,COMMA but had a low level and almost the same happens here .PERIOD now ,COMMA let me make a fast replay of botswana .PERIOD and if people who are infected are treated ,COMMA they don't die of aids .PERIOD in spite of pepfar ,COMMA the generous pepfar ,COMMA all people are not reached by treatment ,COMMA and of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries .PERIOD only 60 percent are left on treatment after two years .PERIOD no ,COMMA it's not look here .PERIOD there's a lot of things that we thought that now good research done by african institutions and researchers together with the international researchers show that that's not the case .PERIOD see the difference within one african country -- .PERIOD it goes from very low level to very high level .PERIOD and most of the provinces in kenya is quite modest .PERIOD so what is it ?QUESTIONMARK then it could be concurrency ,COMMA and we have a terrible chlamydia epidemic ,COMMA -- ,COMMA terrible ,COMMA chlamydia epidemic ,COMMA which sticks around for many years .PERIOD let's talk about past and future billions .PERIOD we know that most of that wealth was made after the year 1800 .PERIOD and notice ,COMMA most of that went to the motherland to the imperial metropoles ,COMMA not to their colonial possessions .PERIOD so i'm going to translate this into language that you can understand .PERIOD let me very briefly .PERIOD tell you what i mean by this synthesizing ,COMMA the work of many economic historians in the process that really was a killer application property rights .PERIOD it's not the democracy folks .PERIOD it's having the rule of law based on private property rights ,COMMA very few indians today wish that india had gone down mahatma gandhi's road .PERIOD finally ,COMMA the work ethic ,COMMA he was wrong .PERIOD take a look at mathematical attainment by 15 year-olds .PERIOD now it's just five times .PERIOD and soon it will be 25 times and could africa get that sequencing wrong .PERIOD one obvious implication of modern economic history is that it's quite hard to transition to democracy before you've established secure ,COMMA private property rights warning that may not work .PERIOD that's the basis for the western model of representative government .PERIOD and i think these words really nail it .PERIOD it means a society based upon the opinion of civilians .PERIOD that's not the way history works .PERIOD that's one of the most profound insights to come out of the historical study of complex institutions like civilizations .PERIOD what's your view on that niall ferguson ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA i really am not just talking about the rise of the east .PERIOD i'm talking about the rise of the rest .PERIOD and that includes south america .PERIOD i once asked one of my colleagues at harvard .PERIOD hey is south america part of the west .PERIOD spiders are not just everywhere ,COMMA but they're extremely diverse .PERIOD spiders are also extremely old ,COMMA even fossil .PERIOD spiders can make silk as we can see from this impression of a spinneret on this fossil spider .PERIOD so this means that both spiders and spider silk have been around for 380 million years .PERIOD you can see multiple fibers coming out of the spinnerets ,COMMA because each spinneret has many spigots on it in an orb-web-weaving spider .PERIOD you can find seven types of silk glands .PERIOD and what i have depicted here in this picture ,COMMA let's start at the one o'clock position .PERIOD there's tubuliform silk glands ,COMMA which are used to make the outer silk of an egg sac .PERIOD so silk fibers vary in their strength ,COMMA and also their extensibility ,COMMA if it wasn't able to stretch so much .PERIOD then basically ,COMMA when an insect hit the web ,COMMA it would just trampoline right off of it .PERIOD some of them are orb-weaving spiders .PERIOD and some of them are non-orb-weaving .PERIOD spiders .PERIOD how do groups get anything done ?QUESTIONMARK right ?QUESTIONMARK how do you organize a group of individuals ?QUESTIONMARK so that the output of the group is something coherent and of lasting value .PERIOD instead of just being chaos and a coordination ,COMMA cost is essentially all of the financial or institutional difficulties in arranging group .PERIOD output more recently ,COMMA because the cost of letting groups communicate with each other has fallen through the floor ,COMMA -- and communication costs are one of the big inputs to coordination -- .PERIOD there has been a second answer ,COMMA which is to put the cooperation into the infrastructure to design systems that coordinate the output of the group as a by-product of the operating of the system ,COMMA without regard to institutional models .PERIOD and what i want to call your attention to is not the mermaid parade itself charming ,COMMA though it is ,COMMA but rather to these photos .PERIOD first of all ,COMMA when you form an institution ,COMMA you take on a management problem .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK you have to have legal structure .PERIOD third forming ,COMMA an institution is inherently exclusionary .PERIOD you can't hire everyone in a company right when you build cooperation into the infrastructure ,COMMA which is the flickr answer .PERIOD you can leave the people where they are .PERIOD and you take the problem to the individuals rather than moving the individuals to the problem in bigger systems .PERIOD the head gets bigger and the tail gets longer .PERIOD so the imbalance increases ,COMMA if you go down to five percent ,COMMA you're still accounting for 60 percent of the photos .PERIOD we've looked at who's contributed to linux ,COMMA and most of the patches have been produced by programmers who've only done one thing right ?QUESTIONMARK do you want that patch ?QUESTIONMARK right ?QUESTIONMARK meetup a service founded .PERIOD so that users could find people in their local area who share their interests and affinities and actually have a real-world meeting offline in a cafe or a pub ,COMMA or what have you stay-at-home moms ?QUESTIONMARK right ?QUESTIONMARK it is a one-button operation that you can do for free .PERIOD and the answer to that question is it doesn't matter because that's not the right question .PERIOD and if there is an answer to that ,COMMA that happens outside the professional framework of journalism ,COMMA it makes no sense to take a professional metaphor and apply it to this distributed class .PERIOD they trade tips like if you feel like eating something clean a toilet or the litter box ,COMMA the feeling will pass .PERIOD we have an attitude that support groups are inherently beneficial .PERIOD now ,COMMA when the larger group is a bunch of drunks and the small group wants to stay sober .PERIOD then we think that's a great support group .PERIOD but when the small group is teenage girls who want to stay anorexic by choice ,COMMA then we're horrified flavor is king flavor rules .PERIOD so this is the challenge for this bread .PERIOD and this is what every student has to begin with everyone who works in the culinary world knows that the first stage of cooking is mise en place ,COMMA which is just a french way of saying get organized everything in its place .PERIOD first stage stage two is mixing ,COMMA we take the ingredients ,COMMA and we mix them .PERIOD and so we in the mixing process have to develop the gluten .PERIOD we have to activate the leaven or the yeast ,COMMA and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly and at stage nine .PERIOD we get the dough to the final shape ,COMMA and it goes into the oven ,COMMA -- stage 10 and the starches ,COMMA when they reach about 180 degrees ,COMMA gelatinize and stage 11 ,COMMA we call it cooling -- ,COMMA because we never really eat the bread right away .PERIOD and we save some of those for the next generation .PERIOD so we turn it into flour .PERIOD not like hot water made cold or cold .PERIOD water turned hot ,COMMA but water ,COMMA boiled off and becoming steam .PERIOD so we've got now this flour ,COMMA and what do we do ?QUESTIONMARK we add some water ,COMMA or another analogy would be a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly .PERIOD but we've got this bread .PERIOD and what i did here is to try to again ,COMMA evoke even more flavor from this grain was we've added into it ,COMMA the spent grain from beer-making .PERIOD and so this is again ,COMMA hopefully not only a healthy bread ,COMMA but a bread that you will enjoy .PERIOD so if i kind of break this bread ,COMMA maybe we can share this now a little bit here ,COMMA we'll start a little piece here ,COMMA and i'm going to take a little piece here -- .PERIOD i think i'd better taste it myself before you have it at lunch .PERIOD let me give you just one example of this .PERIOD now ,COMMA the question is ,COMMA how could we ask them ,COMMA but half the time ?QUESTIONMARK what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go mmmmm broccoli .PERIOD so she'd act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted .PERIOD the question you might ask ,COMMA though ,COMMA is ,COMMA why do children learn so much ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA what kind of explanation could we have for this ?QUESTIONMARK and essentially what bayes did was to provide a mathematical way ,COMMA using probability theory to characterize describe the way that scientists find out about the world ,COMMA and some 10 years ago ,COMMA i suggested that babies might be doing the same thing ,COMMA because if you wave a block over the top of the detector ,COMMA something you wouldn't ever think of to begin with the detector will actually activate two out of three times .PERIOD now ,COMMA there are two things that are really interesting about this .PERIOD the first one is ,COMMA again ,COMMA remember ,COMMA these are four year-olds .PERIOD they're just learning how to count .PERIOD and there's been a bunch of interesting studies .PERIOD recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program .PERIOD i don't know not working either .PERIOD i think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults .PERIOD it's good to be a grownup that technology is simulating humans .PERIOD and what you can see is -- .PERIOD it is actually a very good game .PERIOD i've made him run into a wall here over and over again .PERIOD so we simulated that as well .PERIOD and then the really tricky bit is to teach that network how to walk .PERIOD we heard about those already yesterday .PERIOD and i suppose that most of you are familiar with that already .PERIOD those are then selected by the algorithm reproduced with mutation and recombinations to introduce sex as well .PERIOD now this might look kind of trivial ,COMMA but it's actually very important ,COMMA because this is not something you get at the moment in any interactive or any virtual worlds .PERIOD so that's what you see here .PERIOD we just took this character that i just talked about ,COMMA put it on a slippery surface .PERIOD and this is what you get out of it ,COMMA so that you don't have a character that looks limp .PERIOD but actually a character that you can use in an action film ,COMMA straight away that looks kind of alive in midair as well .PERIOD that's one angle .PERIOD here's another angle .PERIOD so this is exactly the same behavior that you saw ,COMMA but in a slightly better ,COMMA rendered version .PERIOD this is incredibly quick .PERIOD this is happening in real time .PERIOD this is another behavior .PERIOD they requested .PERIOD you feel kind of sorry for the guy .PERIOD it's even worse -- .PERIOD and that is another video .PERIOD i just got last night -- .PERIOD if you render that a bit more realistically .PERIOD yes ,COMMA you can just about see it here .PERIOD now ,COMMA we've just tried and -- looked at our character and asked ourselves ,COMMA can we do that ourselves as well ?QUESTIONMARK this was an ai contour that was produced and evolved -- half-evolved .PERIOD i should say -- to produce balance basically .PERIOD so that all happened automatically .PERIOD we didn't put that in there .PERIOD thanks .PERIOD you can draw as everyone should shake it .PERIOD and you have a heterosexual couple .PERIOD you know ,COMMA i'm making a very important argument .PERIOD i'm making an argument that art and creativity are very essential tools in empathy ,COMMA say ,COMMA your motorcycle crashes .PERIOD ok ,COMMA when i was offered the times column six years ago ,COMMA the deal was like this .PERIOD you'll be sent the coolest hottest slickest ,COMMA new gadgets ,COMMA every week .PERIOD it'll arrive at your door .PERIOD the job though came with one small downside .PERIOD and that is they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column .PERIOD the guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to some of the stories are just so classic .PERIOD and yet so understandable and the technician's like ma'am ,COMMA you've got the mouse up against the screen .PERIOD and we've arrived at the age of interface matrices where there are so many features and options .PERIOD you have to do two dimensions .PERIOD you know ,COMMA a vertical and a horizontal .PERIOD you guys all complained about how microsoft word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically .PERIOD it's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices .PERIOD so there is a limit that we don't want to cross .PERIOD so what is the answer ?QUESTIONMARK i'm sorry .PERIOD it's not one yet .PERIOD you have to scroll like seven screens-full to get to it .PERIOD it's like a 747 shuttle .PERIOD cockpit .PERIOD you do not .PERIOD we've entered planet domination mode .PERIOD they're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh ,COMMA but they can't they're locked in because so many add-ons and other company stuff locks into the old 1982 chassis .PERIOD i liked the media center pc .PERIOD i liked the microsoft spot .PERIOD watch .PERIOD the lesson was simplicity sells .PERIOD here's another example .PERIOD chris .PERIOD you're the source of all power in my very last example -- .PERIOD i do a lot of my work using speech recognition software .PERIOD and you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous .PERIOD i also use this feature called voice .PERIOD macros period ,COMMA correct ,COMMA dissuade ,COMMA not just no new features .PERIOD it's never happened before in software .PERIOD it could be the design of the thing you're using .PERIOD but i also in looking at more powerful technologies and nanotechnology and genetic engineering and other new emerging kind of digital technologies became very concerned about the potential for abuse .PERIOD and we can't fight the threat in the kind of stupid way we're doing because a million-dollar act causes a billion dollars of damage causes a trillion dollar response ,COMMA which is largely ineffective .PERIOD and arguably probably almost certainly has made the problem worse .PERIOD so ,COMMA after giving up on the book ,COMMA -- ,COMMA and i had the great honor to be able to join kleiner perkins about a year ago ,COMMA and to work through venture capital on the innovative side ,COMMA and to try to find some innovations that could address what i saw as some of these big problems ,COMMA things where you know ,COMMA a factor of 10 difference can make a factor of 1000 difference in the outcome .PERIOD the first is this whole area of education ,COMMA and it really relates to what nicholas was talking about with a $100 computer .PERIOD i think the challenge for us is -- .PERIOD i'm very certain that that will happen .PERIOD the challenge is ,COMMA will we develop the kind of educational tools and things with the net to let us take advantage of that device ?QUESTIONMARK i'd argue today that we have incredibly powerful computers ,COMMA but we don't have very good software for them .PERIOD so given that ,COMMA we know and should believe -- because moore's law's been like a constant .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA it's just been very predictable progress over the last 40 years ,COMMA or whatever we have a challenge ,COMMA because the urban population is growing in this century ,COMMA from two billion to six billion in a very short amount of time ,COMMA people are moving to the cities .PERIOD and these are the kinds of things we're going to discover as we start to engineer at the nano scale .PERIOD we believe that genentech the compaq ,COMMA the lotus the sun ,COMMA the netscape ,COMMA the amazon ,COMMA the google in these fields are yet to be found ,COMMA because this materials revolution will drive these things forward .PERIOD and to give you an idea of the last fund that kleiner raised was a $400 million fund .PERIOD so this for us is a very substantial fund .PERIOD and what we did over the last few months -- well ,COMMA a few months ago ,COMMA ray kurzweil .PERIOD and i wrote an op-ed in the new york times about how publishing the 1918 genome was very dangerous .PERIOD you normally get a trivalent vaccine against three possible strains .PERIOD we believe that if we could fill these 10 gaps ,COMMA we have a chance to help really reduce the risk of a pandemic .PERIOD so we're very excited because we think we can fund 10 or speed up 10 projects and see them come to market in the next couple years that will address this .PERIOD but above all ,COMMA what we have to do is we have to help the good guys .PERIOD the people on the defensive side have an advantage over the people who want to abuse things .PERIOD many of them are trying to kill us from the minute .PERIOD we go into them ,COMMA but nevertheless ,COMMA they're absolutely gripping and contain unbelievable .PERIOD biological wonders that are very ,COMMA very different from those that we have on the planet apart from the intrinsic value of the biology and mineralogy and geo-microbiology that we do there .PERIOD we're also using these as templates for figuring out how to go look for life on other planets ,COMMA particularly mars ,COMMA but also europa ,COMMA the small icy moon around jupiter .PERIOD we're getting ready to begin to go through the process of leaving our planet of origin and out into the wider solar system .PERIOD and beyond ,COMMA i think myself that life is a natural outgrowth of the increasing complexification of matter over time .PERIOD it's going to be everywhere .PERIOD we look -- where there are planetary systems that can possibly support it .PERIOD so this is a very bold statement .PERIOD how do you know it when you find it very critically ?QUESTIONMARK how do we protect it ?QUESTIONMARK if we find it and not contaminate it ?QUESTIONMARK if i were to take a swab off your teeth and plate it on a petri plate within about four or five hours ,COMMA i would have to see growth .PERIOD so they are intrinsically a slower life-form .PERIOD it's a very simple trick ,COMMA and i never fail to do it when i'm sitting in a window seat .PERIOD this is regularly several hundred parts per million .PERIOD and these are mineral deposits that are also made by bacteria .PERIOD and so one can send a thousand of them as you can see in this upper left-hand picture ,COMMA a thousand of them could fit into the payload bay that was used for one of the current mer rovers .PERIOD the question as to whether there is life on mars ,COMMA that is related to life on earth has now been very muddied ,COMMA because we now know from mars meteorites that have made it to earth that there's material that can be exchanged between those two planets .PERIOD one of the burning questions ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is if we go there and find life in the sub-surface ,COMMA as i fully expect that we will ,COMMA is that a second genesis of life .PERIOD did it start there and get transported here ?QUESTIONMARK this will be a fascinating puzzle .PERIOD as we go into the next half-century ,COMMA and where i expect that we will have more and more mars missions to answer these questions for real -- .PERIOD you can take a second .PERIOD you've got to feel this to learn it .PERIOD well ,COMMA you could resist the temptation to announce your goal .PERIOD he wouldn't reveal the exact number of bottles .PERIOD he would not reveal exactly where the building was ,COMMA and he would not reveal exactly who owned the building .PERIOD and he ended up spending over a million dollars and hiring ex-fbi and ex-scotland yard agents to try to get to the bottom of this .PERIOD there are very few places in the us where you can try real kobe .PERIOD and one of them is wolfgang puck's restaurant ,COMMA cut in los angeles .PERIOD it was like 160 dollars for this .PERIOD and then i was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta that you know their purpose had been served .PERIOD and so i'm afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me .PERIOD this is soap that's made from silver nanoparticles ,COMMA which have antibacterial properties and it ,COMMA you know ,COMMA tickled a little bit ,COMMA and it smelled good .PERIOD but i have to say that nobody here has complimented me on the cleanliness of my face today .PERIOD these ones gq did spring for -- .PERIOD i own these -- ,COMMA but i will tell you not only did .PERIOD i not get a compliment from any of you .PERIOD i have not gotten a compliment from anybody in the months that i have owned and worn these ,COMMA and then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats' leavings ,COMMA then go through the forest collecting the you know ,COMMA results and processing it into coffee -- ,COMMA although you actually can buy it in the unprocessed form .PERIOD but anyway ,COMMA we had a great night's sleep .PERIOD and you spend a third of your life in bed .PERIOD this is tom cruise arriving at the mission .PERIOD impossible iii premiere when he tries to open the door ,COMMA you could call it mission .PERIOD impossible iv .PERIOD there was one object that i could not get my hands on .PERIOD and that was the 1947 cheval blanc .PERIOD and it was an invitation you do not refuse earlier this year ,COMMA a virtual asteroid in it sold for 330000 real dollars .PERIOD and this is a titan class ship in the space game eve online ,COMMA it gives you great powers .PERIOD your ambition is satisfied ,COMMA but it's very beautiful .PERIOD and so these combine to form a very intense emotional engagement .PERIOD but this isn't the really interesting stuff .PERIOD the really interesting stuff about virtuality is what you can measure with it .PERIOD the game's just trying to get people to open about a million boxes ,COMMA getting better and better stuff in them .PERIOD this sounds immensely boring ,COMMA but games are able to make this process incredibly compelling ,COMMA but we don't just have pies in the boxes .PERIOD and also we say ,COMMA well ,COMMA how many monsters should i have the entire world full of a billion monsters ?QUESTIONMARK they're not rational about probability .PERIOD it's not giving me my last two pies .PERIOD i'm going to give up .PERIOD and the point is really that we evolved to be satisfied by the world in particular ways .PERIOD so you give people lots and lots of different tasks .PERIOD third ,COMMA you reward effort ,COMMA and something very exciting is just beginning to happen in places like the university of bristol in the uk ,COMMA where we are beginning to be able to model mathematically dopamine levels in the brain .PERIOD and the success rate is at close to 100 percent .PERIOD let's start with business ,COMMA but each bag we'd sell would provide a year's worth of school meals for one kid .PERIOD all this time you're -- .PERIOD when you think about hunger ,COMMA it's a hard thing to think about ,COMMA because what we think about is eating .PERIOD there's definitely hunger in america .PERIOD 49 million people and almost 167 million children hunger ,COMMA definitely means something a little bit different in america than it does internationally .PERIOD but it's incredibly important to address hunger in our own country .PERIOD well ,COMMA they're both about food .PERIOD and you know ,COMMA the reality is that between farmers in america ,COMMA who actually quite frankly ,COMMA when i spend time in the midwest are pretty large in general .PERIOD so the problematic food system is affecting both hunger and obesity ,COMMA not to beat a dead horse .PERIOD but this is a global food system where there's a billion people hungry and billion people obese .PERIOD and how are we going to get those kids ?QUESTIONMARK those nutritious foods ?QUESTIONMARK another thing that's become incredibly global is production of meat and fish .PERIOD and we were going to do something that was horrible for the profession ,COMMA and that the incredible amount of effort to deliver those sketches for years and years .PERIOD and years is not only something to be derided ,COMMA but we would merely write it off as merely execution .PERIOD now ,COMMA there are all kinds of things that we architects need to learn how to do like managing contracts ,COMMA learning how to write contracts ,COMMA understanding procurement processes ,COMMA understanding the time value of money and cost estimation .PERIOD take joint positions with your client .PERIOD why was this horrible little building so important to their renown and their innovation ?QUESTIONMARK because they could do whatever they wanted to to this building .PERIOD the architectural manifestation was ,COMMA frankly ,COMMA just dumb .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA it really was the clients who had to do it .PERIOD they had to make a decision based on the positions we took to redefine the budget being from two thirds capital-a architecture and one-third infrastructure to actually the inverse ,COMMA two-thirds ,COMMA infrastructure and one-third capital-a architecture .PERIOD now that theater machine has ability to move between a whole series of configurations at the push of a button ,COMMA and a few stagehands in a short amount of time .PERIOD but it also has the potential to not only provide multiform ,COMMA but multi-processional sequences ,COMMA and some of the seats need to actually change their direction and change their rake to allow that to happen there .PERIOD you see ,COMMA it's the side balconies for the proscenium ,COMMA meaning nothing that we do .PERIOD can we be the first ones to do it ?QUESTIONMARK now ,COMMA if i'll take you through -- ,COMMA this is an early concept sketch .PERIOD -- take you through kind of a mixture of all these things together .PERIOD you would be allowed to bring objects or performers into the performing chamber aida their elephants .PERIOD you can bring the elephants in et voila .PERIOD this is the at&ampt performing arts ,COMMA center's ,COMMA dee and charles wyly theater .PERIOD but we got to that conclusion without understanding where we were going ,COMMA what we knew were a series of issues that the company and the client was confronted with .PERIOD so this is a picture of me ,COMMA holding one of the first watercolor paintings i ever made .PERIOD i have many of these books ,COMMA and i've been keeping them for about the last eight or nine years .PERIOD and i really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody's life ,COMMA as opposed to knowing the whole story ,COMMA just knowing a little bit of the story ,COMMA and then letting your own mind fill in the rest .PERIOD this is a project that scans the world's newly posted blog entries ,COMMA every two or three minutes searching for occurrences of the phrases i feel and i am feeling .PERIOD and when it finds one of those phrases ,COMMA it grabs the full sentence up to the period and also tries to identify demographic information about the author .PERIOD and when that happens these montage ,COMMA compositions are automatically created which consist of the sentence and images being combined .PERIOD i'm 23 and a recovering meth and heroin addict and feel absolutely blessed to still be alive .PERIOD i feel sassy as you can see ,COMMA we feel fine collects very ,COMMA very small-scale personal stories .PERIOD so really even challenging the notion of what can be considered a story .PERIOD and the eskimo community basically camps out on the edge of the ice here waits for a whale to come close enough to attack .PERIOD and when it does it ,COMMA throws a harpoon at it and then hauls the whale up under the ice and cuts it up .PERIOD they have colors .PERIOD what do they look like ?QUESTIONMARK this is in the patkotak's family living room in their house in barrow ,COMMA the boxed wine .PERIOD they served us cigarette break outside -- .PERIOD i don't smoke so you have some really happy person holding 10 balloons ,COMMA and some really sad soul holding one balloon ,COMMA a 16-year-old student .PERIOD i asked her about that ,COMMA and she said ,COMMA she meant that she doesn't want to be married ,COMMA because in her opinion ,COMMA when you get married in bhutan ,COMMA as a woman ,COMMA your chances to live an independent life kind of end .PERIOD and so she had no interest in that a 37-year-old road worker .PERIOD his wish was to make some money and open a store .PERIOD finally ,COMMA this is a 26-year-old nun .PERIOD i spoke to i asked her a little bit more about the cave ,COMMA and what she planned would happen .PERIOD once she went there ,COMMA you know ,COMMA jonathan harris ,COMMA maybe you'll die .PERIOD woman :COLON yes .PERIOD yeah .PERIOD but -- .PERIOD yeah ,COMMA ok .PERIOD do you hope -- .PERIOD would you prefer to live in the cave for 40 years or to live for one year ?QUESTIONMARK woman :COLON yes ,COMMA from then i'm going to the heaven .PERIOD you can start to see some familiar balloons here .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD so the approach that we took was the other way around .PERIOD what you see here is a prototypic device .PERIOD it's made of paper and paper ,COMMA of course ,COMMA wicks fluid ,COMMA as you know ,COMMA paper cloth -- drop wine on the tablecloth and the wine wicks all over everything .PERIOD so the production capability is there and the procedure that we have is simply to start with paper .PERIOD you can't manipulate it very well ,COMMA although i'll show something about that in a moment .PERIOD so you take the drop of blood ,COMMA no further manipulations .PERIOD you put it on a little device ,COMMA the device filters out ,COMMA the blood cells lets the serum go through .PERIOD and you get a series of colors down in the bottom .PERIOD there turns out to work actually quite well ,COMMA particularly when your color printer has printed the color bars that indicate how things work .PERIOD i don't know whether the idea of one computer .PERIOD one child makes any sense .PERIOD here's the computer of the future ,COMMA because this screen is already there and they're ubiquitous .PERIOD the answer is that what you do and the details are not terribly important here is to make something more elaborate .PERIOD you take several different layers of paper ,COMMA each one containing its own little fluid system ,COMMA and you separate them by pieces of literally double-sided carpet tape the stuff you use to stick the carpets onto the floor .PERIOD but that is ,COMMA in principle ,COMMA the way you solve the fever of unexplained origin problem .PERIOD because each one of those spots then becomes a test for a particular set of markers of disease .PERIOD and this will work in due course .PERIOD now i have one last two last little stories to tell you in finishing off this business .PERIOD we were very proud of this ,COMMA particularly the title ,COMMA which was eggbeater as centrifuge .PERIOD we all struggled for an entire day to think about simplicity .PERIOD why are we spending $135 billion in the fourth act with our hubris our overconfidence developing ?QUESTIONMARK we invaded iraq and afghanistan .PERIOD and in the fifth act ,COMMA we plunged into a humiliating mess .PERIOD when i walked across afghanistan in the winter of 2001-2002 ,COMMA what i saw was scenes like this in sangin ,COMMA where i was sick in 2002 .PERIOD the nearest health clinic was within three days walk and the same is true for the troops .PERIOD and the reason i'm looking a little bit perplexed in this photograph is i was somewhat frightened .PERIOD and i was too afraid .PERIOD on this occasion to ask him having run for an hour through the desert and taken refuge in this house ,COMMA why he had turned up and wanted to have his photograph taken with me .PERIOD now ,COMMA this is not to say ,COMMA afghanistan is a place full of people like mullah mustafa .PERIOD i ran a center at harvard from 2008 to 2010 .PERIOD and there were people like michael semple there who speak afghan languages fluently who've traveled to almost every district in the country ,COMMA you feel deep deep guilt .PERIOD the average british soldier is on a tour of only six months ,COMMA italian soldiers on tours of four months ,COMMA the american military on tours of 12 months .PERIOD so we need to change that institutional culture .PERIOD secondly ,COMMA we need to aim off of the optimism of the generals borders between the bosniak territory ,COMMA and the bosnian-serb territory have calmed down .PERIOD if what we're interested in is regional stability .PERIOD egypt is far more important .PERIOD just briefly .PERIOD what's your take on the current events there and the intervention ?QUESTIONMARK what we should have done in libya is we should have stuck to the un resolution for the first time in the united states ,COMMA a predominantly white group of voters voted for an african-american candidate for president .PERIOD but really the question here :COLON -- obama did relatively well in kansas ,COMMA actually ,COMMA we didn't ask them ,COMMA but when they conducted exit polls in every state in 37 states out of the 50 ,COMMA they asked a question that was pretty direct about race .PERIOD and they ask a series of really interesting questions ,COMMA but you see democrats versus republican ,COMMA not a big difference based on who your neighbors are .PERIOD and likewise ,COMMA they asked not in 2000 ,COMMA but in the same survey in 1996 ,COMMA would you not vote for a qualified black president ?QUESTIONMARK i'm a big fan of cities .PERIOD and it was followed a year or two later by laennec discovering the stethoscope .PERIOD it's been on calendars ,COMMA postage stamps in many different countries .PERIOD i call it the ipatient .PERIOD they understood her breast cancer at the molecular level .PERIOD they had no need to touch her breasts ,COMMA but to her ,COMMA it mattered deeply .PERIOD we marry ,COMMA for example ,COMMA with great pomp and ceremony and expense to signal .PERIOD our departure from a life of solitude and misery and loneliness to one of eternal bliss .PERIOD i would feel the abdomen .PERIOD i remember so many huge hollowed out haunted eyes staring up at me as i performed this ritual .PERIOD it was an offering an invitation .PERIOD it's the -- .PERIOD it's produced by the quadro corporation of west virginia .PERIOD you could dowse for all sorts of things .PERIOD but this particular one was built to dowse for marijuana in students' lockers .PERIOD so the way it works is you go down the hallway ,COMMA and you see if it tilts toward a particular locker ,COMMA and then you open the locker .PERIOD no ,COMMA it -- .PERIOD well ,COMMA it has kind of a right-leaning bias .PERIOD you can say a miracle occurs ,COMMA whereas -- .PERIOD and it's true scientists ,COMMA sometimes throw terms out as linguistic place ,COMMA fillers -- ,COMMA dark energy ,COMMA or dark matter ,COMMA or something like that -- ,COMMA until we figure out what it is .PERIOD we'll just call it this -- .PERIOD it's the beginning of the causal chain for science .PERIOD you don't even need photoshop .PERIOD you don't need high-tech equipment .PERIOD you don't need computers .PERIOD in the case of galileo .PERIOD he had two problems when he turned his telescope to saturn .PERIOD and this is what he ended up concluding that he saw .PERIOD so without a theory of planetary rings ,COMMA and with only grainy data ,COMMA you can't have a good theory ,COMMA and it wasn't solved until 1655 .PERIOD and so you're reducing the quality of your data ,COMMA virgin mary in clearwater florida .PERIOD here's the virgin mary on the backside ,COMMA which they started to wipe off .PERIOD and in england ,COMMA there's a pop singer in america .PERIOD it would be .PERIOD we're 6000 light years from the edge .PERIOD and so if we can do that ,COMMA then we can free up resources for buying drugs that you really do need for treating aids and hiv and malaria and for preventing avian flu .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD that is the primary function of an incubator .PERIOD and then we thought of the most simple solution we could to address this problem .PERIOD he connected with people who cared about this nonprofessionals people with passion .PERIOD henry ford comes up with a really cool idea .PERIOD it enables him to hire men who used to get paid 50 cents a day and pay them five dollars a day .PERIOD and you can build an entire industry on that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the pirate tribe is a fascinating one .PERIOD so when al gore set out to change the world again ,COMMA he didn't do it by himself .PERIOD what kevin kelley has taught us is you just need .PERIOD i don't know a thousand true fans ,COMMA -- ,COMMA a thousand people who care enough that they will get you the next round .PERIOD and the next round .PERIOD and the next round ,COMMA the beatles did not invent teenagers .PERIOD she didn't invent the idea of caring about this issue .PERIOD i see what the status quo is .PERIOD i don't like it .PERIOD someone stands up and says ,COMMA this one is important ,COMMA because if you're not upsetting anyone ,COMMA you're not changing the status quo ,COMMA because focusing on that part of it -- ,COMMA not the mechanics of what you're building ,COMMA but the who and the leading part -- is where change comes .PERIOD so here is what leaders have in common .PERIOD the first thing is ,COMMA they challenge the status quo .PERIOD the second thing is ,COMMA they build a culture .PERIOD thank you very much .PERIOD i appreciate it .PERIOD they have different interests .PERIOD they have divergent values .PERIOD they were created

,COMMA there is actually a very long tradition of this .PERIOD and to my mind ,COMMA those are pretty wise words ,COMMA no matter what your creed .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD this is tootsie's orchid lounge in nashville .PERIOD and the size of the room is not that big .PERIOD he wanted a bigger band .PERIOD the halls got bigger ,COMMA carnegie hall's fair-sized .PERIOD and they're a lot more

music as well .PERIOD and he's singing right into your ear .PERIOD he's whispering into your ears .PERIOD now ,COMMA there's venues like this ,COMMA a discotheque ,COMMA and there's jukeboxes in bars where you don't even need to have a band .PERIOD and as with jazz ,COMMA the dancers liked certain sections more than they did others .PERIOD so that doesn't really work .PERIOD and it turns out that a sound like this is the most energy efficient and practical way to transmit their call across the fields and savannahs .PERIOD it's adaptive ,COMMA and i'm saying ,COMMA well ,COMMA the passion's still there ,COMMA but the vessel that it's going to be injected into and poured into that is instinctively and intuitively created .PERIOD first ,COMMA we sing ,COMMA and like the birds ,COMMA the joy is still there .PERIOD even though we have changed what we do to fit the context as a clergyman .PERIOD you can imagine how out of place i feel .PERIOD and i was so stimulated .PERIOD but some years ago i was on an elevator in philadelphia coming down .PERIOD but i was on an airplane in the east some years ago .PERIOD and the man sitting across the aisle .PERIOD from me ,COMMA was the mayor

to bridge the disconnect between our generation and the generation of young women .PERIOD today .PERIOD we've worked with over 300 .PERIOD this is the dream of the african girl .PERIOD but sadly ,COMMA the vision of a great future ,COMMA or the dream of a great future is just a dream ,COMMA because you have all of these vices .PERIOD this is a real rural village .PERIOD now that was the advice that st benedict gave his rather startled followers in the fifth century up .PERIOD until that moment ,COMMA i had been that classic corporate warrior -- .PERIOD i was eating too much .PERIOD i

from the south bronx .PERIOD and luckily ,COMMA for me that home and the love inside of it along with help from teachers ,COMMA mentors and friends along the way was enough are these factors taken into consideration ?QUESTIONMARK when land-use policy is decided once we realized that we decided it was time to do our own planning .PERIOD anyway ,COMMA i know chris told us not to do pitches up here .PERIOD but since i have all of your attention ,COMMA we need investors end of pitch anyway ,COMMA -- .PERIOD ok ,COMMA katrina prior to katrina .PERIOD the south bronx and new orleans' ninth ward ,COMMA had a lot in common .PERIOD both were largely populated by poor people of color ,COMMA both hotbeds of cultural innovation .PERIOD think hip-hop and jazz in the post-katrina era .PERIOD we have still more in common .PERIOD neither the destruction of the ninth ward ,COMMA nor the south bronx was inevitable at present .PERIOD that's not happening in new york city .PERIOD and although less than 25 percent of south bronx residents own cars ,COMMA these projects include thousands of new parking spaces ,COMMA yet zip in terms of mass public transit .PERIOD i do have a problem with developments that hyper-exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit .PERIOD but one of the things i do to remind myself of greater possibilities is to learn from visionaries in other cities .PERIOD he looked at the demographics ,COMMA his administration narrowed key ,COMMA municipal thoroughfares ,COMMA from five lanes to three outlawed parking on those streets expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes created public plazas created one of the most efficient bus mass-transit systems in the entire world .PERIOD i don't think he understood that .PERIOD i wasn't asking for funding .PERIOD this is more or less what we saw last year .PERIOD and this is how it will go on into the future ,COMMA because you see now i presented statistics that don't exist .PERIOD and this is gdp per capita .PERIOD on this axis ,COMMA the last century 1870 was bad for the kids in europe ,COMMA because most of this statistics is europe .PERIOD and this is the united states moving away here ,COMMA earning more money .PERIOD let us have a look at the united states within some years .PERIOD chile may have better child survival than the united states .PERIOD that's the part where i sold the volvo and bought the toyota .PERIOD and now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in japan .PERIOD sweden was like ghana ,COMMA because i have to show you one of the other facilities .PERIOD we can also make the color here represent the variable -- .PERIOD and what am i choosing here ?QUESTIONMARK and there we are 2001 .PERIOD the world is quite a messy place .PERIOD this is two to five dollars .PERIOD you have a bed .PERIOD i lectured on this for ikea ,COMMA and they wanted to see the sofa immediately here .PERIOD i would say that sub-saharan africa has done best in the world during the last 50 years .PERIOD and that's good .PERIOD it gets two .PERIOD plusses environment is very ,COMMA very crucial .PERIOD of course ,COMMA it's human rights and culture culture is the most important thing .PERIOD i would say ,COMMA because that's what brings joy to life .PERIOD even african countries can achieve this .PERIOD it's a cultural expression that for thousands of years ,COMMA has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious .PERIOD and so cars ,COMMA as art brings it into an emotional plane ,COMMA -- ,COMMA if you accept that -- that you have to deal with on the same level ,COMMA you would with art with a capital a now .PERIOD at this point ,COMMA you're going to see a picture of michelangelo .PERIOD automobiles are self-moving things ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK elevators are automobiles .PERIOD cars are a sculpture -- .PERIOD did you know this ?QUESTIONMARK ok ,COMMA it's not marketing .PERIOD there's a very interesting car concept here ,COMMA but the marketing part is not what i want to talk about here .PERIOD it's that will to live that need to survive to express itself that comes in a car ,COMMA and takes over people like me .PERIOD and we tell other people do this .PERIOD do this do this until this thing comes alive .PERIOD we are completely infected ,COMMA and beauty can be the result of this infectiousness .PERIOD it's quite wonderful now .PERIOD now ,COMMA i get to the point .PERIOD i want to talk about cars as art .PERIOD we're not trying to find vanity and beauty .PERIOD and that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence in why we're doing what we're doing toothbrush .PERIOD cool .PERIOD i heard today about joseph's death genes that have to go in and kill cell reproduction .PERIOD this is very difficult ,COMMA and you have to have a bond with your team that permits you to do this ,COMMA because their life is wrapped up in that too .PERIOD this is 1996 we did this project .PERIOD and so we sent them off with this team name ,COMMA deep blue .PERIOD now ,COMMA many people know deep blue from ibm -- .PERIOD we actually stole it from them ,COMMA because we figured ,COMMA if anybody read our faxes ,COMMA they'd think we're talking about computers ,COMMA and a group of engineers worked in germany .PERIOD and the idea was they would work separately on this problem of what's the successor to the suv .PERIOD they would come together .PERIOD compare notes ,COMMA then they would work apart come together .PERIOD and they would produce together a monumental set of diverse opinions that didn't pollute each other's ideas -- .PERIOD but at the same time came together and resolved the problems .PERIOD the bathroom was so big .PERIOD she built the bed over the bathtub -- .PERIOD it's quite fascinating .PERIOD well ,COMMA what i didn't know was ,COMMA and what we found out was -- these guys .PERIOD they can't even like talk to each other under those conditions .PERIOD there was a whole lot of dialog .PERIOD we spent four hours being told all about vocabulary that needs to be built between engineers .PERIOD and designers dialog kept on going with mental maps of words .PERIOD and pretty soon it was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance ,COMMA i was seriously being baffled with bullshit ,COMMA because ,COMMA of course ,COMMA they didn't tell us that they had three station wagons full of drawings ,COMMA model concepts pictures ,COMMA -- everything .PERIOD i wanted .PERIOD they'd locked up in the cars ,COMMA because they had shown solidarity with the engineers -- .PERIOD and they'd decided not to show me anything in order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start ,COMMA because they hadn't realized ,COMMA of course ,COMMA that they couldn't do problem creating .PERIOD it's true that the trust and the love that makes it worthwhile .PERIOD we didn't sequence his genome .PERIOD and the reason is that cancer ,COMMA like every cell ,COMMA in the body places ,COMMA little molecular bookmarks little post-it notes that remind the cell i'm cancer .PERIOD i should keep growing .PERIOD we just started mailing it to our friends .PERIOD and as we treat it with our compound ,COMMA this addiction to sugar this rapid growth faded .PERIOD and in fact ,COMMA this molecule prevents this adipocyte ,COMMA this fat stem cell from remembering how to make fat such that mice on a high fat diet ,COMMA like the folks in my hometown of chicago fail to develop fatty liver ,COMMA which is a major medical problem .PERIOD this molecule will soon leave our benches and go into a small startup company called tensha therapeutics .PERIOD i've never seen really anywhere this unique support for cancer research ,COMMA the age of the universe between now .PERIOD and the big bang is a hundred billion in dog years .PERIOD if you looked at one of these galaxies and measured its velocity ,COMMA it would be moving away from you .PERIOD and if you look at a galaxy even farther away ,COMMA it would be moving away faster that kind of makes sense to us the air in this room is very smooth in particular .PERIOD things were a lot denser .PERIOD what you have to think about is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies ,COMMA a hundred billion stars ,COMMA each we'd like to understand that .PERIOD one of the people who did understand that .PERIOD this was a problem was richard feynman .PERIOD the arrow of time cannot be completely understood until the mystery of the beginnings of the history of the universe are reduced still further from speculation to understanding .PERIOD it's not true that we've figured it out by .PERIOD now ,COMMA the reason the problem has gotten worse ,COMMA rather than better is because in 1998 ,COMMA we learned something crucial about the universe that we didn't know before .PERIOD and so ,COMMA even though the universe will last forever and ordinary matter and radiation will dilute away .PERIOD there will always be some radiation ,COMMA some thermal fluctuations ,COMMA even in empty space .PERIOD it will probably increase .PERIOD and the probability is enormously huge .PERIOD remember life itself depends on the arrow of time .PERIOD occasionally ,COMMA you will make a planet or a star or a galaxy ,COMMA or a hundred billion galaxies .PERIOD now ,COMMA your homework assignment is to really think about this to contemplate what it means .PERIOD i just showed you this picture .PERIOD they all happen over a period of time equal to 10 to the 10 to the 120 years .PERIOD so here's two questions for you .PERIOD maybe there is something that naturally through the growth of the laws of physics gives rise to universe like ours in low entropy configurations ,COMMA my bold speculation is that i will be absolutely vindicated by history .PERIOD and 50 years from now ,COMMA all of my current wild ideas will be accepted as truths by the scientific and external communities .PERIOD this is a prediction i might be wrong .PERIOD i would like to share that story today ,COMMA like everyone else .PERIOD we grew maize .PERIOD i felt very happy to be at the secondary school .PERIOD so i was determined to do anything possible to receive education .PERIOD so i went to a library .PERIOD so i would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the africans ,COMMA and the poor who are struggling with your dreams .PERIOD god bless unlike most of our computing devices ,COMMA these objects are much more fun to use a gesture of namaste ,COMMA maybe to respect someone or maybe -- in india .PERIOD i don't need to teach a kid that this means four runs in cricket .PERIOD so i was interested in these two rollers ,COMMA and i actually wanted more .PERIOD so i borrowed another mouse from a friend -- never returned to him -- .PERIOD and i now had four rollers .PERIOD what i got is basically a gesture interface device that actually acts as a motion-sensing device made for two dollars what we are interested in is information .PERIOD so i thought around last year -- in the beginning of the last year -- .PERIOD i started thinking ,COMMA why can i not take this approach in the reverse way ?QUESTIONMARK but later ,COMMA i realized that i actually wanted to interact with those digital pixels .PERIOD also ,COMMA you stop by a wall and start painting on that wall .PERIOD so technically it's a little bit complex ,COMMA but it gives you an output ,COMMA which is more intuitive to use in some sense ,COMMA rather than getting your camera out of your pocket .PERIOD you can just do the gesture of taking a photo .PERIOD and it takes a photo for you once it has that information .PERIOD it finds out more reviews about that ,COMMA or maybe new york times has a sound overview on that .PERIOD so you can actually hear on a physical book ,COMMA a review as sound .PERIOD so i was seeing the live [video] of his talk outside on just a newspaper .PERIOD so what i did here is remove the camera -- ,COMMA all the webcam cameras have a microphone inside the camera .PERIOD and i am a wilderness explorer in tribe ,COMMA 54) .PERIOD and you can ,COMMA of course ,COMMA play games .PERIOD yeah .PERIOD and i say ,COMMA ok ,COMMA this looks nice .PERIOD let me print it out that thing .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD this is incredible really .PERIOD and now ,COMMA if you see ,COMMA it's more about the cost-effectiveness .PERIOD this system costs ,COMMA you $300 compared to the $20000 surface tables or anything like that ,COMMA or maybe even the $2 mouse gesture system at that time was costing around $5000 .PERIOD no ,COMMA this theory comes from an expert on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding .PERIOD and you know who i mean ,COMMA charles darwin taste for both natural beauty ,COMMA and for the arts travel across cultures ,COMMA with great ease .PERIOD now i personally have no doubt whatsoever that the experience of beauty with its emotional intensity .PERIOD and pleasure belongs to our evolved human psychology .PERIOD now ,COMMA keeping these ideas firmly in mind .PERIOD we can say that the experience of beauty is one of the ways that evolution has of arousing and sustaining interest or fascination even obsession in order to encourage us toward making the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction .PERIOD beauty is nature's way of acting at a distance .PERIOD so to speak ,COMMA consider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure ,COMMA the magnetic pull of beautiful landscapes ,COMMA their symmetry ,COMMA their attractive materials ,COMMA and above all their meticulous workmanship are simply quite beautiful to our eyes .PERIOD even today competently made hand axes indicated desirable ,COMMA personal qualities ,COMMA -- intelligence ,COMMA fine motor control ,COMMA planning ,COMMA ability ,COMMA conscientiousness and sometimes access to rare materials .PERIOD so before i talk about this car for the blind ,COMMA let me briefly tell you about another project that i worked on called the darpa urban challenge .PERIOD now ,COMMA this was about building a robotic car that can drive itself .PERIOD so it's a small tablet has many holes in it and compressed air comes out .PERIOD so it can actually draw images ,COMMA and he's [unclear] following that van that's out in front of him .PERIOD so since we started this project ,COMMA we've been getting hundreds of letters ,COMMA emails phone calls from people from all around the world ,COMMA but potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the spin-off technology that can come from this project .PERIOD why do we call it that ?QUESTIONMARK i don't know taiwan straits 2025 .PERIOD let's talk about an enemy embedded within that battle space .PERIOD they said we couldn't do iraq .PERIOD you have to create internal partners .PERIOD you have to access coalition partners .PERIOD we asked the russians for 40000 .PERIOD they said ,COMMA no ,COMMA like saddam like mugabe like kim jong-il -- people who kill in hundreds of thousands or millions like the 250000 dead so far in sudan .PERIOD and let's call this red line .PERIOD i don't know mission accomplished .PERIOD what we need downstream is a great power enabled -- .PERIOD what i call that sys admin force .PERIOD you've got to track coalition partners ,COMMA create a record of success .PERIOD so they start moving from reality towards desire ,COMMA and they create their own special language to describe their voyage of self-discovery and self-actualization .PERIOD we bought one military ,COMMA and we operated another .PERIOD i used to give this brief inside the pentagon in the early 1990s .PERIOD bad pentagon ,COMMA bad ,COMMA it elevates ,COMMA mootw ,COMMA -- ,COMMA how we pronounce that acronym -- from crap to grand strategy ,COMMA because that's how you're going to shrink that gap .PERIOD a department of war ,COMMA a department of everything else .PERIOD our long-term rationale becomes we're involved in a hair .PERIOD trigger stand off with the soviets .PERIOD the question is ,COMMA how do we reconnect american national security with global security to make the world ,COMMA a lot more comfortable and to embed and contextualize ,COMMA our employment of force around the planet ,COMMA just be grateful ?QUESTIONMARK robert reed didn't shove that bomb up his ass .PERIOD i love this force .PERIOD i don't want to see it go .PERIOD what does this mean in terms of operations the force on the right in and out the force on the right's going to obliterate it different definitions of network centricity ?QUESTIONMARK but ultimately ,COMMA you're going to civilianize .PERIOD it probably two thirds .PERIOD but you need lots of these guys on the ground to win the peace .PERIOD the point about the trigger-pullers and special operations command .PERIOD see me now don't talk about it later .PERIOD the world is my playground .PERIOD i want the rules to be as loose as possible .PERIOD the town was burned down .PERIOD it was in the middle of winter ,COMMA and it was a very ,COMMA very severe winter .PERIOD and that's what we're going through at this time .PERIOD i wanted to just talk for one minute about the future of biotechnology ,COMMA because i think i know very little about that -- .PERIOD i'm not a biologist -- .PERIOD so everything i know about .PERIOD it can be said in one minute ,COMMA but that's hard to do .PERIOD unfortunately ,COMMA the ice is thick ,COMMA but we can look outside very cheaply ,COMMA and in a simple fashion ,COMMA and the step from the ocean to the land was not easy .PERIOD but it happened .PERIOD so they would have to have something like a reptilian skin .PERIOD the sunlight in jupiter on the satellites of jupiter is 25 times fainter than it is .PERIOD here since jupiter is five times as far from the sun .PERIOD this was -- originally when radio astronomy began mr ,COMMA jansky at the bell labs ,COMMA detected ,COMMA radio waves coming from the sky .PERIOD since there was nothing there .PERIOD you might as well .PERIOD not look .PERIOD there is something called pit lamping .PERIOD so these creatures will be bright against the cold surroundings .PERIOD i call these creatures sunflowers ,COMMA if we don't find them ,COMMA then we can create them ourselves in the long run .PERIOD of course ,COMMA it would also make it possible for us to move out there ,COMMA but in the long run ,COMMA if there's no life there ,COMMA we create it ourselves .PERIOD so again ,COMMA we have a big and wonderful future to look forward .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD and i realized then i had to go to design school ,COMMA or what's this num lock key for ,COMMA you know that thing ?QUESTIONMARK and i didn't want to be a colorist .PERIOD and that allows me to check my timer discretely here without bending ,COMMA my elbow and something a little bit more experimental .PERIOD this is a light fixture for swarovski .PERIOD and what it does is it changes shape .PERIOD and the new experience i was looking for is giving the choice for the user to go from a warm ,COMMA sort of glowing kind of mood light ,COMMA all the way to a bright work light .PERIOD i want to point at something here on the left .PERIOD and this allows the bottle to turn into a game the bottles connect together ,COMMA and you can create different shapes different forms .PERIOD and then the integration of all ,COMMA these great technologies ,COMMA which you've heard about the wi-fi antennas that allow the kids to connect the screen ,COMMA which you can read in sunlight ,COMMA the keyboard ,COMMA which is made out of rubber ,COMMA and it's protected from the environment .PERIOD and if anybody asks why you're carrying a condom ,COMMA you can just say you like the design much of my life has been a quest to get some answers to these questions .PERIOD i was born and raised here in india .PERIOD and i learned from an early age to be deeply suspicious of the aunties and uncles who would bend down pat us on the head ,COMMA and then say to my parents with no problem at all poor things ,COMMA you only have three daughters late that night .PERIOD i heard my mother ,COMMA begging my father ,COMMA please do something ramu .PERIOD can't you intervene ?QUESTIONMARK this is tradition .PERIOD she said to me ,COMMA it is not about the burka had i heard right .PERIOD she is on the taliban's hit list .PERIOD their path is their own .PERIOD and it looks towards an afghanistan that will be different .PERIOD their repertoire includes the croatian national anthem ,COMMA a bosnian love song and serbian duets in the middle ages ,COMMA troubadours would travel across the land singing their tales and sharing their verses .PERIOD lesbor

see them sitting on the ground ,COMMA their arms ,COMMA linked the police are called in to physically remove the women .PERIOD and then you realize that by integrating aspects of tradition and community into their struggles women like sakena and leah and layma -- ,COMMA but also women like sonia gandhi here in india and michelle bachelet in chile and shirin ebadi in iran ,COMMA -- are doing something else .PERIOD and the first thing i wanted to do as a muslim was go to mecca and visit the kaaba ,COMMA the holiest shrine of islam .PERIOD and i did that i put on my ritualistic dress .PERIOD i went to the holy mosque .PERIOD i did my prayers .PERIOD i observed all the rituals .PERIOD in other words ,COMMA men and women were worshiping all together .PERIOD and i think it's not an accident that you don't find this idea in the very origin of islam .PERIOD on the other hand ,COMMA the westerners who look at islamic culture and see some troubling aspects should not readily conclude that this is what islam ordains and the religious police imposes ,COMMA the supposed islamic way of life on every citizen by force .PERIOD -- like women are forced to cover their heads .PERIOD -- wear the hijab the islamic head cover .PERIOD let me give you an example in turkey ,COMMA where i come from ,COMMA which is a very hyper-secular republic ,COMMA until very recently ,COMMA we used to have what i call secularism police ,COMMA which would guard the universities against veiled students .PERIOD in other words ,COMMA they would force students to uncover their heads .PERIOD and i think forcing people to uncover their head is as tyrannical as forcing them to cover it ,COMMA which means that muslims can today look at those things and say ,COMMA well ,COMMA the core of our religion is here to stay with us .PERIOD and even the very extreme forms of islamism led to terrorism in the name of islam -- ,COMMA which is actually a practice that i think is against islam .PERIOD but some obviously extremists did not think that way .PERIOD and i think the west at least some powers in the west ,COMMA particularly the united states made the mistake of supporting those secular dictators thinking that they were more helpful for their interests .PERIOD secondly ,COMMA in the past two decades ,COMMA thanks to globalization .PERIOD thanks to the market economy .PERIOD thanks to the rise of a middle-class .PERIOD we in turkey .PERIOD see what i define as a rebirth of islamic modernism as a photographer for national geographic .PERIOD i've portrayed it for many and where that energy touches water ,COMMA something new emerges life ,COMMA shallow seas ,COMMA nurtured life early on .PERIOD and that's where it morphed into more complex forms .PERIOD the fundamental forms of

you about ethnic conflict and civil war .PERIOD but let's start at the beginning .PERIOD well ,COMMA notwithstanding ,COMMA the gloomy pictures from the middle east ,COMMA darfur ,COMMA iraq elsewhere .PERIOD there is a longer-term trend that does represent some good news .PERIOD the news about civilian casualties is also less bad than it used to be .PERIOD thus ,COMMA even though every civilian killed maimed ,COMMA raped or tortured ,COMMA is one too many .PERIOD the fact that the number of civilian casualties is clearly lower today than it was a decade ago is good news .PERIOD but let's look at the good news again .PERIOD but then is northern ireland .PERIOD a unique example ,COMMA or does this kind of explanation only hold more generally in democratic and developed countries .PERIOD a final example kosovo .PERIOD central among them are three by the same token -- .PERIOD and here we have some good news again ,COMMA -- .PERIOD the very fact that there is a high-level well-resourced international presence in kosovo and the balkans region ,COMMA more generally .PERIOD and the fact that local leaders on both sides have showed relative restraint explains why things have not been worse over the past two years since 2008 ,COMMA a final thought ,COMMA ending civil wars is a process that is fraught with dangers ,COMMA frustrations and setbacks .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD i'm going to talk about some of my discoveries around the world through my work .PERIOD and at that young age 10 years old ,COMMA benki became the paje of his community .PERIOD he went 3000 miles on an odyssey to rio to the earth summit to tell the world ,COMMA what was happening in his tiny little corner .PERIOD benki came back to his village full of ideas .PERIOD -- new technologies ,COMMA new research ,COMMA new ways of understanding what was going on .PERIOD he's built schools to teach children to care for the forest together .PERIOD he's led the reforestation of over 25 percent of the land that had been destroyed by the loggers .PERIOD why are you putting yourself at risk ?QUESTIONMARK so when i think of that ,COMMA i wonder what our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren ,COMMA when they ask themselves that question ,COMMA i wonder how they will answer for me .PERIOD the world is veering towards a future .PERIOD we don't much want when we really think about it deep inside .PERIOD you also know that we can't just keep doing what we've always done ,COMMA because we'll get the results .PERIOD we've always gotten .PERIOD we have to change .PERIOD it's imperative to me when i look around the world that we need to change ourselves .PERIOD sanghamitra didn't start life as a leader of an ngo .PERIOD she started her career as university professor teaching english literature .PERIOD they take care of 20000-odd people today in over 1000 villages around karnataka ,COMMA they've pioneered a different approach to villages instead of handing out information in pamphlets ,COMMA as is so often the case they bring theater troupes songs music dance ,COMMA sanghamitra told me just last week -- .PERIOD she had just come back from two weeks in the villages ,COMMA and she had a real breakthrough .PERIOD he has nine other buildings -- that are already open to the public -- filled to the rafters with artifacts documenting contemporary chinese history .PERIOD they looked outside ,COMMA and then they changed .PERIOD what was on the inside .PERIOD they've gone away from what they did before .PERIOD and they've gone to something .PERIOD they didn't know he went around once he went around twice .PERIOD he went around thrice .PERIOD and so when you study it ,COMMA you realize that different people of the world have a different understanding of the world .PERIOD perhaps he was a jain monk like bahubali over here .PERIOD the gomateshwara bahubali whose image is not far from mysore .PERIOD alexander asked ,COMMA what are you doing ?QUESTIONMARK and they both laughed what should you not be ?QUESTIONMARK you should not be sisyphus ,COMMA who rolls a rock up a mountain all day ,COMMA only to find the boulder rolled down at night .PERIOD and he wanted to hoist his flag to say i was here first .PERIOD this was the mythology of the gymnosophist ,COMMA but they were not two characters on two different adventures .PERIOD you see the indians also had a river that separates the land of the living from the land of the dead .PERIOD you go again and again .PERIOD and again ,COMMA two different mythologies ,COMMA two different ways of looking at the world .PERIOD and i believe it is this mythological paradigm that inspired indian mathematicians to discover the number zero ,COMMA who knows standard business model .PERIOD vision mission values processes .PERIOD you see ,COMMA this is what india is today .PERIOD the ground reality is based on a cyclical world view .PERIOD i have personally experienced it .PERIOD i'm trained as a medical doctor ,COMMA and he knew very intuitively that best practices developed in japan and china and europe .PERIOD and america will not work in india .PERIOD you can't measure it .PERIOD you can't manage it after a leader ,COMMA completes his training and is about to take over the store .PERIOD we blindfold him .PERIOD we surround him with the stakeholders .PERIOD the customer his family ,COMMA his team ,COMMA his boss that sensitivity is what we need .PERIOD once .PERIOD this belief enters behavior .PERIOD will happen business will happen .PERIOD but that was interesting in itself .PERIOD this is companies like vonage .PERIOD the little box has your phone number .PERIOD it's really cute seeing middle-aged people like me ,COMMA try out skype for the first time ,COMMA which is usually when their kid goes away for a semester abroad .PERIOD they don't want to pay the international fees .PERIOD so they're like timmy is that you imagine ,COMMA if you had an ordinary cell phone and any time you were in a wireless hotspot ,COMMA -- free calls anywhere in the world ,COMMA never pay the cellular company ,COMMA a nickel .PERIOD and when you're out of the hotspot ,COMMA you're on the regular cellular network .PERIOD you're thinking ,COMMA well ,COMMA how often am i in a hotspot ?QUESTIONMARK because they give you a regular ,COMMA wireless router that works with the phone for your house .PERIOD they don't have that kind of money .PERIOD instead .PERIOD they give each of us a seven-dollar-and-95-cent box .PERIOD they're like a stealth tower installation program .PERIOD now i'm leaving the house dp .PERIOD i'm going for a walk -- .PERIOD do you mind ?QUESTIONMARK i don't know why my wife says ,COMMA i never listen to her .PERIOD i don't get that .PERIOD i have two cellphones .PERIOD so this going to be very odd if it works .PERIOD excuse me .PERIOD one .PERIOD second ,COMMA all right ,COMMA we've made the point .PERIOD the beauty of that is you never miss a call google bought it .PERIOD and they've been working on it for a year .PERIOD i actually got a photograph of the verizon employee right there .PERIOD anyway .PERIOD so lets say you need a drugstore near chicago here .PERIOD it comes and it's already written down -- .PERIOD so like if you're driving ,COMMA you don't have to do one of these things .PERIOD uh ,COMMA huh ?QUESTIONMARK uh ,COMMA huh ?QUESTIONMARK uh ,COMMA huh .PERIOD shortly .PERIOD i'll tell you why i was in milan that's cute .PERIOD i do have an email address .PERIOD you can just ask me ,COMMA it's absolutely phenomenal .PERIOD the only downside is that it requires you to know how to text .PERIOD -- ,COMMA send a text message .PERIOD nobody over 40 knows how to do that .PERIOD so i'm going to teach you something even better .PERIOD they put this teeny-weeny little ad about 10 characters long ,COMMA because there is one as you can imagine .PERIOD it's college kids and old people when i call to leave you a message .PERIOD i get 15 seconds of instructions from a third-grade teacher on ambien .PERIOD so now i'm going to tell you how to get out of that .PERIOD the reason i think that is that on the first day ,COMMA i tried one of these services .PERIOD i got two voicemail messages .PERIOD one was from a guy named michael stevenson ,COMMA which shouldn't be that hard to transcribe .PERIOD and it was misspelled .PERIOD i love my job .PERIOD i'm not kidding .PERIOD you the message said ,COMMA was walking along the street and sky was blue and emergency .PERIOD and lastly ,COMMA i just have to talk about this one phone .PERIOD well ,COMMA that's good .PERIOD what are you doing ?QUESTIONMARK actually ,COMMA even so he was turned down by verizon and others .PERIOD it's got bad things and good things .PERIOD lets all acknowledge that right now .PERIOD it's absurd .PERIOD we have power outlets in every room of every building .PERIOD we have running water .PERIOD you type in what you want ,COMMA and it gives you the translation .PERIOD i know it's insane ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK it will immediately play you that song or that band ,COMMA if you like that ,COMMA one or don't like it ,COMMA you do thumbs-up and thumbs-down over time .PERIOD it tailors the songs so that it completely stops playing bad songs .PERIOD it proposes a restaurant .PERIOD and now the end is near ,COMMA i want an iphone who cares if it's at&ampt ,COMMA because the breast has become are very political organ .PERIOD i will do my best this morning to tell you what i think is the truth .PERIOD but first ,COMMA my disclosures ,COMMA she came to see me after discovering a breast lump .PERIOD you may recall a year ago ,COMMA when a firestorm erupted after the united states preventive services ,COMMA task force reviewed the world's mammography screening literature ,COMMA and issued a guideline recommending against screening mammograms in women in their 40s screening .PERIOD the average young woman with an mri is kind of like driving to the grocery store in a hummer .PERIOD but the problem was that the gamma detectors were these huge bulky tubes ,COMMA and they were filled with these scintillating crystals ,COMMA and you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast to find small tumors to say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement .PERIOD but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work that we chipped away with incremental modifications to this system .PERIOD the patient receives an injection of a radio tracer .PERIOD that's taken up by rapidly ,COMMA proliferating tumor cells ,COMMA but not by normal cells .PERIOD and this is the key difference from mammography .PERIOD our big break came in 2004 after we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors .PERIOD we used these images to submit a grant to the susan g ,COMMA komen foundation ,COMMA and we were elated when they took a chance on a team of completely unknown investigators and funded us to study 1000 women with dense breasts ,COMMA comparing a screening mammogram to an mbi .PERIOD here's an example from that screening study .PERIOD it takes a radiologist years of specialty training to become expert in differentiating ,COMMA the normal anatomic detail from the worrisome finding .PERIOD but i suspect even the non-radiologists in the room can find the tumor on the mbi image .PERIOD after the fourth rejection ,COMMA we requested reconsideration of the manuscript ,COMMA because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected .PERIOD it had a financial conflict of interest in a competing technology ,COMMA some women who develop breast cancer die from it .PERIOD many years later and most women ,COMMA thankfully ,COMMA survive .PERIOD so i worked with white noise and do not be disturbed any more by the other aggressive sound .PERIOD but it is just physiology .PERIOD it's just in your brain .PERIOD so in order to make this white noise a little bit active and reactive ,COMMA i create a ball ,COMMA a rolling ball able to analyze and find where does aggressive sound come from and roll at home ,COMMA or at work towards aggressive noise and emits white noise in order to neutralize it .PERIOD a loving dispute with your girl or boyfriend .PERIOD anyway ,COMMA in this same kind of approach .PERIOD i designed k .PERIOD i'm just a designer ,COMMA so i need them .PERIOD and the irony for me was ,COMMA of course ,COMMA i didn't do that for the sake of science progress .PERIOD i just do that to make money .PERIOD so we took too many of them .PERIOD this one is an antibiotic ,COMMA but in this case ,COMMA it is not the medication that is dependent on the patient .PERIOD so the idea is all night long ,COMMA the elastic skin of the third lung will slowly inflate itself including air and molecules for sure you have to know ,COMMA or you probably already know that indoor air pollution is more toxic than outdoor one .PERIOD so while i'm talking to you the seats ,COMMA you are sit on are currently emitting some invisible and odorless toxic gas .PERIOD sorry for that .PERIOD so your sofa ,COMMA your plastic chair ,COMMA your kid's toys ,COMMA give their own invisible reality .PERIOD and this one is very toxic .PERIOD this one is kind of the same approach ,COMMA because i include in a product like andrea ,COMMA some plants .PERIOD indeed ,COMMA this object is a domestic farm for fishes and green .PERIOD so the idea of this object is to be able to get at home ,COMMA very local food after it goes back into the fish tank .PERIOD now ,COMMA we can eat local food .PERIOD see like this one ,COMMA you can see it there .PERIOD we're the new technologists .PERIOD i think about world war ii ,COMMA -- ,COMMA some of our great technologists .PERIOD then some of our great physicists studying nuclear fission and fusion -- just nuclear stuff .PERIOD we want the people building the technology thinking about what we should be doing with the technology .PERIOD so we can protect ourselves if he was up to no good .PERIOD so to get people warmed up ,COMMA let's start with an easy question .PERIOD -- something .PERIOD i'm sure everybody .PERIOD here has an opinion about iphone versus android .PERIOD but he was worried that all we seem to be doing is trading opinions about this in math .PERIOD we know the objective facts .PERIOD it's an objective truth about the form of two ,COMMA the abstract form ,COMMA then you would know what was really just .PERIOD and what wasn't if you think that way you have a platonist moral framework ,COMMA he thought it was impractical .PERIOD it's just a matter of the consequences .PERIOD kant was very good on this point .PERIOD and he said it a little better than i'll say it .PERIOD what should we be doing ?QUESTIONMARK what's the answer ?QUESTIONMARK there's not a formula and don't just find another technologist ,COMMA friend find somebody different than you .PERIOD we care .PERIOD what happens in that opera ,COMMA in the early '80s ,COMMA some would say the gang had no way to make money .PERIOD so he was a math major in college who had a good heart and decided he wanted to get a sociology phd came to the university of chicago .PERIOD and in his own words ,COMMA he looked like a freak .PERIOD so he showed up at the university of chicago .PERIOD there was a lot of gunfire .PERIOD there were a lot of philosophical discussions .PERIOD he had with the gang members and you .PERIOD and i probably faced with the situation would think ,COMMA well ,COMMA i guess i'm going to write my dissertation on the grateful dead .PERIOD but the thing that really makes the gang seem like mcdonald's is its franchisees .PERIOD so what do the wages look like ?QUESTIONMARK so you might be surprised we found in our gang -- .PERIOD and admittedly ,COMMA this was not really sort of a standard situation .PERIOD this was a time of intense violence ,COMMA -- of a lot of gang wars -- as this gang actually became quite successful .PERIOD but there were costs that makes you pause -- gives you some pause -- .PERIOD those of you who believe that a death penalty's going to have an enormous deterrent effect on crime that the young people controlled the gang -- that as you got older ,COMMA you dropped out of the gang .PERIOD so what happened was the people who happened to be in the right place at the right time .PERIOD -- .PERIOD the people who happened to be leading the gang in the mid- to late '80s -- became very ,COMMA very wealthy .PERIOD you know ,COMMA he would say to his friends ,COMMA hey ,COMMA look at all the money .PERIOD i got in the gang ,COMMA often our theories fail quite miserably .PERIOD when we go to the data ,COMMA this is one of the basic ideas in labor economics called a compensating differential .PERIOD it's why we think garbage men might be paid more than people who work in parks .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK so ,COMMA in the words of one of the members of the gang ,COMMA i think makes this clear and the words of a gang member capture it quite nicely .PERIOD if you start taking losses ,COMMA they see you as weak and shit ,COMMA and i thought about it .PERIOD and i said ,COMMA ceos often pay themselves million-dollar bonuses ,COMMA even when companies are losing a lot of money ,COMMA also different aerobatic maneuvers are possible with a paraglider .PERIOD you can see the skydiver with the red suit .PERIOD he's in a stand-up position .PERIOD this is a jump .PERIOD i did in rio de janeiro 2005 .PERIOD i did a base jump from the eiger from the monk .PERIOD and from the jungfrau three ,COMMA very famous mountains in switzerland ,COMMA june cohen ,COMMA i have some questions yet ,COMMA but people are trying are you among those -- ?QUESTIONMARK you're not going to commit -- .PERIOD are you among those trying to do it ?QUESTIONMARK it's a dream .PERIOD it's a dream .PERIOD yeah ,COMMA and is that how you usually fly .PERIOD do people come to you with projects and say ,COMMA we want you to do this .PERIOD i don't necessarily think the film is .PERIOD so interesting .PERIOD the show was in a sense about that .PERIOD i also put a mirror in the ceiling and some fog ,COMMA some haze .PERIOD and what happens is that people they start to see themselves in this space .PERIOD what does it matter ?QUESTIONMARK it makes a difference ,COMMA whether you say ,COMMA i'm a part of this city .PERIOD it's quite simple .PERIOD and fundamental ,COMMA it doesn't really tell you what you're looking at ,COMMA or is that a three-hour hike ,COMMA or is that a whole day .PERIOD i'm looking at ,COMMA if you have a waterfall in there right out there at the horizon ,COMMA you look at the waterfall and you go .PERIOD oh ,COMMA the water is falling really ,COMMA slowly .PERIOD and experience is not just a kind of entertainment in a non-casual way .PERIOD so art ,COMMA in that sense ,COMMA i think holds an incredible relevance in the world in which we're moving into ,COMMA particularly right now ,COMMA what i really enjoyed about this project is reviving .PERIOD these people's words .PERIOD so what we're going to do next is a poem that was written by nathalia crane .PERIOD the next poem is ,COMMA if no one ever marries me ,COMMA he went there after the death of his wife of smallpox and brought his two young children ,COMMA just bring it down a little .PERIOD thank you so much ,COMMA or this idea of the misunderstood ,COMMA genius frustrated that the world doesn't fit in with his or her ideas .PERIOD and quite often we sit in a design meeting .PERIOD and we discover that there is this great idea ,COMMA but for another client in another culture ,COMMA it could really be the right answer to a different question .PERIOD and they chose this mascot ,COMMA because the theme of the expo is better city better life .PERIOD but then we looked at recent urban development .PERIOD and we noticed that this is like a shanghai street 30 years ago ,COMMA all bikes ,COMMA no cars .PERIOD so if you come to the expo go straight to the danish pavilion get a danish bike and then continue on that to visit the other pavilions .PERIOD and in the middle of this sort of harbor bath ,COMMA we're actually going to put the actual little mermaid .PERIOD so the second story that i'd like to tell is actually starts in my own house ,COMMA and we discovered that by controlling the size of the holes ,COMMA we could actually turn the entire facade into a gigantic naturally ,COMMA ventilated ,COMMA rasterized image .PERIOD it has no water .PERIOD it has no energy ,COMMA no resources .PERIOD they accumulate the solar energy .PERIOD yes ,COMMA maybe just to round off .PERIOD i'm just going to list some of them ,COMMA where should we start on solving these problems to climate change ?QUESTIONMARK that would be like kyoto .PERIOD i'd love to go into and get you to think about this process .PERIOD and that's actually what we did .PERIOD of course you have to ask yourself ,COMMA why on earth was such a list never done before .PERIOD nobody wants to do this .PERIOD we'd like to know these things ,COMMA three of the world's top experts saying ,COMMA what can we do ?QUESTIONMARK what would be the price ?QUESTIONMARK and of course ,COMMA i'm very happy .PERIOD you asked that question -- -- ,COMMA because that's a very good question .PERIOD this offends ,COMMA a lot of people ,COMMA and that's probably one of the things where people will say i shouldn't come back either .PERIOD and i'd like to talk about that ,COMMA because that's really curious .PERIOD the reason why they came up with saying that kyoto -- or doing something more than kyoto .PERIOD -- is a bad deal is simply because it's very inefficient .PERIOD it's not to say that if we had all the money in the world ,COMMA we wouldn't want to do it .PERIOD there are many problems out there in the world .PERIOD and what i want to make sure of is ,COMMA if we actually focus on problems that we focus on the right ones ,COMMA the ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good .PERIOD and of course ,COMMA we'll be even richer than that .PERIOD we have ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the day after tomorrow -- .PERIOD it looks great ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK it's not about making things that have the most media attention ,COMMA but it's about making places where we can actually do the most good .PERIOD but the point ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is still to say ,COMMA if you get another 100 billion dollars ,COMMA we still want to spend that in the best possible way .PERIOD don't we .PERIOD so we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem .PERIOD my studio in bali was only 10 minutes away from a monkey forest and monkeys ,COMMA of course ,COMMA are supposed to be the happiest of all animals .PERIOD the serif is not really in place .PERIOD and the rider thinks that he can tell the elephant ,COMMA what to do .PERIOD but the elephant really has his own ideas .PERIOD and from that point of view ,COMMA we turned it into a lovely project .PERIOD we stir this in until it's completely dissolved ,COMMA and then pour it into a growth bath .PERIOD and then we're ready to add the living organism ,COMMA and actually in hot weather .PERIOD i can just grow it outside .PERIOD but i do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition to our increasingly precious natural resources .PERIOD thank you very much .PERIOD suzanne lee ,COMMA i made contact with a child from swat who studied in a madrassa like this ,COMMA how do the taliban in your area get people to join them ?QUESTIONMARK then they take us to a madrassa and teach us things from the koran .PERIOD they ask us to use them only against the infidels soc .PERIOD i in my research have seen that the taliban have perfected the way in which they recruit and train children .PERIOD and i think it's a five-step process .PERIOD these children are explicitly forbidden from reading newspapers ,COMMA listening to radio ,COMMA reading any books that the teachers do not prescribe them ,COMMA effectively the taliban create a complete blackout of any other source of information for these children .PERIOD he blew himself up killing six two years ago .PERIOD here at ted ,COMMA i reported that we had discovered at saturn with the cassini spacecraft ,COMMA an anomalously warm and geologically active region at the southern tip of the small saturnine moon enceladus seen here ,COMMA while they're not amino acids .PERIOD we're now finding things like propane and benzene ,COMMA hydrogen ,COMMA cyanide and formaldehyde .PERIOD so we are very encouraged by these results .PERIOD and this is quite an extraordinary idea .PERIOD but it is reality today .PERIOD this was created by an architectural firm called shiro .PERIOD and you can actually walk into it .PERIOD now ,COMMA 3d printing can break away barriers in design ,COMMA which challenge the constraints of mass production .PERIOD there's a lower chance of rejection .PERIOD the piece of software will keep an individual within the bounds of the possible .PERIOD i don't think that will happen .PERIOD soon we're now instead of shipping a product across the world ,COMMA we're sending data across the internet and applying this to the idea of building up what's in our bodies .PERIOD so one of the pioneers ,COMMA for example ,COMMA is dr ,COMMA anthony atala .PERIOD and he has been working on layering cells to create body parts ,COMMA -- bladders valves kidneys .PERIOD we like different things .PERIOD i've been working on issues of poverty for more than 20 years .PERIOD and so it's ironic that the problem that and question that i most grapple with is how you actually define poverty .PERIOD what does it mean ?QUESTIONMARK and i would see kids on the street corners ,COMMA and they'd say obama ,COMMA he's our brother ,COMMA and she said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the poverty wasn't so bad .PERIOD it was the humiliation and the embarrassment of it all .PERIOD and i say ,COMMA 'look at me ,COMMA you are not dead .PERIOD and in the middle of this economic crisis ,COMMA where so many of us are inclined to pull in with fear .PERIOD i think we're well suited to take a cue from jane and reach out recognizing that being poor doesn't mean being ordinary .PERIOD it was a really big excitement for me to get into caltech .PERIOD and i concluded after researching every other technology that we could deploy for storing energy ,COMMA -- ,COMMA flywheels different formulations of batteries ,COMMA -- .PERIOD it just wasn't practical to store energy .PERIOD there are a lot of new things that are happening to do that .PERIOD but fundamentally the process requires a tremendous amount of energy .PERIOD so i tried to figure out what other way could we try and make cost-effective solar electricity ?QUESTIONMARK traditionally ,COMMA concentrators ,COMMA look like this .PERIOD your efficiency goes down with more bounces ,COMMA because you lose about 10 percent with each bounce .PERIOD but this allowed us to collect light from a plus or minus 25 degree angle .PERIOD so once you have mobility now ,COMMA you're making a lot of engines ,COMMA because you've got lots of units as opposed to steam ships or big factories ,COMMA where you're not making as many units .PERIOD so this was the engine that ended up benefiting from mass production ,COMMA where all the other engines didn't benefit .PERIOD so we tried to look at the stirling engine in a new way ,COMMA because it was practical -- weight .PERIOD no longer mattered for our application .PERIOD the internal combustion engine took off because weight mattered because you were moving around .PERIOD so someone came up with a very clever idea to -- ,COMMA instead of heating the whole cylinder and cooling the whole cylinder .PERIOD what about if you put a displacer inside -- ,COMMA a little thing that shuttles the air back and forth ?QUESTIONMARK we measured each one .PERIOD we readjusted the model to what we measured .PERIOD and then we led that to the current prototype .PERIOD it led to a very compact inexpensive engine .PERIOD and this is what the engine looks like .PERIOD so an example of that is ,COMMA here's the map of the united states .PERIOD and of course ,COMMA look at africa .PERIOD there's 10000 watts of light ,COMMA pouring on the stage .PERIOD one horsepower is 756 watts at full power .PERIOD but everywhere around us ,COMMA we have insatiable use for energy because it's so cheap .PERIOD and it's cheap ,COMMA because we've been subsidized by energy that's been concentrated by the sun headlines that look like this ,COMMA when they have to do with climate change and headlines that look like this ,COMMA when they have to do with air quality or smog .PERIOD and this is the tower from below .PERIOD so ,COMMA as you can imagine ,COMMA the inside of this aircraft doesn't look like any plane ,COMMA you would take on vacation .PERIOD we do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule .PERIOD what i am always thinking about is what this session is about ,COMMA which is called simplicity .PERIOD so i was fortunate enough to be born a very dreamy child .PERIOD and that was a good thing to help .PERIOD you know ,COMMA the cause .PERIOD but then he came back and things happened .PERIOD and i decided i really hated my writing that it was awful .PERIOD awful purple prose .PERIOD well ,COMMA tibor really started the studio called m&ampco that to be able to talk about content to break apart what you normally expect to use humor and surprise ,COMMA elegance and humanity in your work was really important to us .PERIOD i don't really -- .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA i could tell you that i didn't understand .PERIOD i'm not proud of it ,COMMA but i didn't understand ,COMMA let's say ,COMMA 95 percent of the talks at this conference .PERIOD so i'm open to the possibilities of not knowing and finding out something new .PERIOD and so i was able to put that into this story ,COMMA which is an alphabet ,COMMA and hopefully go on to something else .PERIOD i work for the new yorker ,COMMA and i do covers and 9/11 happened .PERIOD and it was ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a complete and utter end of the world as we knew it .PERIOD we hoped we'd be funny ,COMMA but we didn't know it would be a cover .PERIOD and we didn't know that that image at the moment that it happened would be something that would be so wonderful for a lot of people .PERIOD and david remnick ,COMMA who was really wonderful about it had one problem .PERIOD he didn't like al zheimers ,COMMA because he thought it would insult people with alzheimer's .PERIOD and he noticed a large stain in the center of the rug .PERIOD so what i did when i was painting was ,COMMA i started singing because i really adore singing .PERIOD and i think that music is the highest form of all art .PERIOD i happen to know it for a fact ,COMMA maybe amongst themselves .PERIOD they had a few good laughs .PERIOD but stalin was a paranoid man ,COMMA even more than my father ,COMMA which i think i made up ,COMMA which is a good thing .PERIOD i received a box in the mail ,COMMA and it was wrapped with newspaper .PERIOD and there was the picture of the man on the newspaper ,COMMA and he was dead .PERIOD and i really spend a lot of time wondering ,COMMA how much truth do we tell ?QUESTIONMARK how do we know when we are ourselves a quote ?QUESTIONMARK by bertrand ,COMMA russell all the labor of all the ages ,COMMA all the devotion ,COMMA all the inspiration ,COMMA all the noonday brightness of human genius are destined to extinction .PERIOD and i would like to run it for them .PERIOD and it says ,COMMA ich habe genug ,COMMA which is a bach cantata ,COMMA which i once thought meant i've had it .PERIOD i can't take it anymore .PERIOD give me a break ,COMMA but i was wrong .PERIOD i thought that things would be pretty fun ,COMMA and there would be more things to play with .PERIOD so since we've been here this week ,COMMA we've taken millions of breaths collectively .PERIOD and perhaps we haven't witnessed any course changes happening in our lives ,COMMA but we often miss the very subtle changes .PERIOD so we threw in -- .PERIOD we created a primordial soup with lots of pieces of robots -- with bars with motors with neurons .PERIOD we're concerned in the national security community .PERIOD and of course ,COMMA in the biology community and the public health community ,COMMA it's also carried on migration ,COMMA patterns of wild migratory aquatic birds .PERIOD so what have people been doing with this money ?QUESTIONMARK let's everybody run around and play your role .PERIOD most local facilities would all be competing to try and get their hands on their piece of the federal stockpile of a drug called tamiflu ,COMMA which may or may not be helpful -- .PERIOD i'll get into that -- of available vaccines and any other treatments and masks and anything that's been stockpiled .PERIOD and you'll have massive competition during the sars epidemic in beijing .PERIOD quarantine did seem to help and their hand got contaminated with the outside of the mask .PERIOD and then they rubbed their nose .PERIOD bingo ,COMMA they got sars the pandemic circulated ,COMMA three times in 18 months in the absence of commercial air travel .PERIOD this was based on european and north american data ,COMMA and that a more likely toll is somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 to 100 million people before we had commercial air travel .PERIOD so are we ready if you expand that out to think of a whole community ,COMMA or all your employees in your company ,COMMA you begin to realize how limited the tamiflu option might be .PERIOD but really do you really have a place to stockpile 18 months worth of food .PERIOD twenty-four months worth of food .PERIOD do you want to view the pandemic threat ?QUESTIONMARK the way back in the 1950s people ,COMMA viewed the civil defense issue and build your own little bomb shelter for pandemic flu ?QUESTIONMARK and i hope i've convinced you of that ,COMMA which means that the real job is go out and say to your local leaders and your national leaders .PERIOD why haven't you solved these problems ?QUESTIONMARK but can you sustain your company that way the moment that you see any evidence of serious human-to-human to transmission ?QUESTIONMARK the mechanism isn't clear again .PERIOD we don't really know for sure .PERIOD audience member :COLON one of the things i've heard is that the real death cause when you get a flu is the associated pneumonia ,COMMA and that a pneumonia vaccine may offer you 50 percent better chance of survival .PERIOD and so far in the h5n1 cases in people .PERIOD similarly ,COMMA bacterial infection has not been an issue at all ,COMMA and it won't do any good to bring in the tanks and the artillery because those t-cells don't recognize it either .PERIOD now ,COMMA my story has a lot to do with dreaming ,COMMA although i'm known to make my dreams .PERIOD come true .PERIOD one ,COMMA two ,COMMA three ,COMMA four ,COMMA five ,COMMA six and seven .PERIOD and i go to see a famous magician and proudly ask him .PERIOD well ,COMMA what do you think for the move to be professional ?QUESTIONMARK it has to be less than one second .PERIOD and it has to be perfect .PERIOD but in america ,COMMA you have to explain what are clubs .PERIOD they have to be precisely lathed anyway .PERIOD here i was progressing with my new clubs .PERIOD the clubs were escaping me at each throw .PERIOD so i proudly showed him my clubs .PERIOD he said ,COMMA philippe ,COMMA you have been had .PERIOD they are impossible to juggle .PERIOD i get a pair of pliers and some coat hangers .PERIOD and i gather them together in some kind of ropey path .PERIOD well ,COMMA within a few days ,COMMA i'm able to do one crossing if not i will never do that .PERIOD first step .PERIOD it's a straight line ,COMMA which sags which sways ,COMMA which vibrates which rolls on itself ,COMMA which is ice ,COMMA which is three tons tight ,COMMA ready to explode ,COMMA ready to swallow me ,COMMA an inner howl .PERIOD assails me ,COMMA the wild longing to flee .PERIOD i was not interested in collecting the gigantic in breaking records and something happened .PERIOD he didn't know the true story .PERIOD trees are wonderful arenas for discovery because of their tall stature ,COMMA their complex structure ,COMMA the biodiversity ,COMMA they foster and their quiet beauty .PERIOD the most mysterious part of forests is the upper tree canopy .PERIOD these are not epiphyte roots .PERIOD these are roots that emerge from the trunk and branch of the host trees themselves .PERIOD we know it's a lot ,COMMA but we do not yet know ,COMMA the answers to how much and by what processes carbon is being taken out of the atmosphere ,COMMA held in its biomass and moving on through the ecosystem .PERIOD they ended up making a cd ,COMMA which they took home to their family and friends ,COMMA thereby expressing their own experiences with nature in their own medium .PERIOD they were incredibly enthusiastic about the work .PERIOD and they embraced the idea that they could help develop a research design in order to grow these mosses .PERIOD we gave talks once a month ,COMMA and that actually ended up implementing .PERIOD some amazing sustainability projects at the prisons .PERIOD -- ,COMMA organic gardens ,COMMA worm culture ,COMMA recycling ,COMMA water catchment and beekeeping .PERIOD as many of you are aware .PERIOD the world of academia is a rather inward-looking one .PERIOD i'm trying to help researchers move more outward to have their own partnerships with people outside of the academic community .PERIOD when i look into my heart ,COMMA i see trees -- .PERIOD this is actually an image of a real heart -- .PERIOD there are trees in our hearts .PERIOD there are trees in your hearts .PERIOD it was taken 18 years ago .PERIOD there is a problem with scuba ,COMMA though ,COMMA in that it imposes some limitations on how deep you can go .PERIOD and it turns out that depth is about 200 feet .PERIOD and there's a phenomenon called henry's law that says that gases will dissolve into a fluid in proportion to the partial pressures ,COMMA which you're exposing them to you die .PERIOD also because oxygen toxicity can cause a seizure .PERIOD -- makes you convulse underwater ,COMMA not a good thing to happen underwater .PERIOD this picture was taken 300 feet deep ,COMMA catching new species of fish .PERIOD and indeed ,COMMA there is a better way .PERIOD alright closed-circuit rebreather ,COMMA -- .PERIOD what is it about it that makes it different from scuba ?QUESTIONMARK and why is it better ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA there are three main advantages to a rebreather .PERIOD so we need another gas something to dilute the oxygen with .PERIOD but if we want to go deeper ,COMMA of course ,COMMA we need another gas supply .PERIOD now ,COMMA normally you don't have to do that ,COMMA because all of it's done automatically for you with the electronics .PERIOD the third system of a rebreather .PERIOD and yes ,COMMA it's a little nerve-wracking .PERIOD so sharks aren't quite as dangerous as most people make them out to be .PERIOD there's a cover story .PERIOD all about the great explorers of our time .PERIOD the last article is an article entitled no new frontiers ,COMMA even if you ignore the scientific value of this thing ,COMMA just look at the monetary value of this thing .PERIOD and then eventually i got around to looking in my bucket .PERIOD now ,COMMA this one's pretty cool .PERIOD so a very large percentage of what is out there isn't really known .PERIOD we thought we had a handle on all the reef fish ,COMMA diversity ,COMMA -- ,COMMA evidently ,COMMA not at the beginning .PERIOD i told you that i was going to show you two extraordinary photographs .PERIOD the reason i show this -- ,COMMA not to put a downer on everything -- .PERIOD but i just want to use it to key off .PERIOD my philosophy of life in general ,COMMA which is that we all have two goals .PERIOD the first goal we share with every other living thing on this planet ,COMMA which is to survive .PERIOD i call it perpetuation the survival of the species and survival of ourselves ,COMMA because they're both about perpetuating the genome .PERIOD you have to balance those two goals .PERIOD but here's what really perplexed me ,COMMA but diagnosing a brain disorder without actually ,COMMA looking at the brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem ,COMMA based on their physical symptoms ,COMMA without even doing an ecg ,COMMA or a chest x-ray to look at the heart yet ,COMMA despite all the advances in medical technology ,COMMA the diagnosis of brain disorders in one in six children still remained so limited .PERIOD and then i came across a team at harvard university that had taken one such advanced medical technology and finally applied it .PERIOD instead of in brain research towards diagnosing brain disorders in children and another program called statistical probability mapping then performs mathematical calculations to determine whether any of these abnormalities are clinically significant ,COMMA allowing us to provide a much more accurate neurological diagnosis of the child's symptoms .PERIOD when we used this groundbreaking eeg technology to actually look at justin's brain .PERIOD the results were startling ,COMMA but we are now in a new era of neuroscience ,COMMA one in which we can finally look directly at brain function in real time ,COMMA with no risks and no side effects non-invasively and find the true source of so many disabilities in children .PERIOD it's something like life that once you get in it ,COMMA you can't get out .PERIOD there are two clips .PERIOD i want to show you the first one is a kind of hodgepodge .PERIOD its just three little moments ,COMMA four little moments with three of the people who are here tonight .PERIOD it was built entirely by hand off bamboo scaffolding people carrying these baskets of concrete on their heads ,COMMA dumping them in the forms .PERIOD so those are the two clips i'm going to show .PERIOD i mean as tragic as his death was in a railway station .PERIOD it was so consistent with his life .PERIOD you know ,COMMA man ,COMMA yes ,COMMA it is the national image of bangladesh .PERIOD no .PERIOD he never saw this .PERIOD and this is the largest project he has got in here ,COMMA the poorest country in the world .PERIOD it's a story of nations of ideologies of territories ,COMMA and of conflicts among them .PERIOD here are we alone in this vast universe of energy and matter and chemistry and physics ,COMMA whether we're born in san francisco or sudan or close to the heart of the milky way galaxy .PERIOD we are the products of a billion-year lineage of wandering stardust .PERIOD well ,COMMA what about 10^22 that line would have to be 38 million miles above this stage ?QUESTIONMARK i think this is what david deutsch meant in 2005 .PERIOD when he ended his oxford tedtalk by saying ,COMMA he had two principles he'd like to share for living .PERIOD and he would like to carve them on stone tablets .PERIOD we've been searching ever since ,COMMA but it's impossible to overstate .PERIOD the magnitude of the search that remains and over those long distances .PERIOD its signal is very faint when it reaches us .PERIOD but this is a simple signal .PERIOD and tomorrow we want to be able to find more complex signals .PERIOD this is a very good year .PERIOD 2009 is the 400th anniversary of galileo's .PERIOD first use of the telescope ,COMMA darwin's 200th birthday ,COMMA the 150th anniversary of

accessed and manipulated where new algorithms could be developed and old algorithms made more efficient .PERIOD i'm sorry ,COMMA seth godin .PERIOD but over the millennia ,COMMA we've seen where tribalism leads it records .PERIOD the annual rise and fall of greenhouse gases and temperatures going back before the onset of the last ice ages ten times a day ,COMMA they extract the 10-foot long

number of things .PERIOD imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics .PERIOD they have to ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA make sure this ice never gets warmer than about 20 degrees below zero ,COMMA otherwise the key gases inside .PERIOD it will dissipate early explorers ,COMMA sailed off the edge of the map .PERIOD and they found a place where the normal rules of time and temperature seem suspended .PERIOD it is a voice of experience .PERIOD it is a voice .PERIOD we should heed .PERIOD this thesis is set out in a book called winning the oil endgame that four colleagues .PERIOD and i wrote and have posted for free at oilendgamecom -- about 170000 downloads so far .PERIOD so when we did ,COMMA we found some very surprising things and serious competition from europe from korea .PERIOD and next is china ,COMMA which will soon be a major net exporter of cars .PERIOD the point here is these cars are going to be made super efficient .PERIOD the question is who will make them ?QUESTIONMARK it's financeable in the private capital market .PERIOD and in the upper left ,COMMA a pioneering effort 14 years ago ,COMMA by gm ,COMMA -- 84 miles a gallon ,COMMA without even using a hybrid in a four-seater in the airplane business .PERIOD it's again ,COMMA a similar story ,COMMA where the first 20 percent fuel ,COMMA saving is free as boeing is now demonstrating in its new dreamliner .PERIOD and it turns out that these are quite remarkable for safety .PERIOD the golf was totaled because these materials could actually absorb six to 12 times as much energy per pound as steel and do .PERIOD so a lot more smoothly .PERIOD this expands choice rapidly in the market and actually makes more money for automakers as well .PERIOD i'd like to deal with the lack of affordable personal mobility in this country by making it very cheaply possible for low-income families to get efficient reliable ,COMMA warranted ,COMMA new cars that they could otherwise never get this creates a new million-car-a-year market for detroit from customers .PERIOD they weren't going to get otherwise because they weren't creditworthy and could never afford a new car .PERIOD it turns out that if say african-american and white households had the same car ownership ,COMMA it would cut employment disparity about in half by providing better access to job opportunities ,COMMA just turn it over to the private sector .PERIOD and we have an internet ours is on the demand side .PERIOD i was just coming out of a failed virtual reality business and supporting myself by being on the speaking circuit and writing books -- after twenty years ,COMMA or so in the computer game industry having ideas that people didn't think they could sell .PERIOD and at the end of those remarkable conversations with kids and their best friends across the united states .PERIOD after two years ,COMMA we pulled together some survey data from another 10000 children drew up a set up of what we thought were the key findings of our research and spent another year transforming them into design heuristics for designing computer-based products ,COMMA -- .PERIOD and in fact ,COMMA any kind of products -- for little girls ,COMMA ages ,COMMA eight to 12 .PERIOD and these voices will be accompanied by photographs that they took for us of their lives of the things that they value and care about girl 3 .PERIOD this is my pretend [unclear] one .PERIOD this is the second day in rockett's life .PERIOD i wanted to show you the ways innocuous as they seem in which we're incorporating what we've learned about girls ,COMMA -- their desires to experience greater emotional flexibility ,COMMA and to play around with the social complexity of their lives .PERIOD he went through europe through world war ii ,COMMA stealing extorting ,COMMA and occasionally buying various paintings for his collection .PERIOD so he finally found an art dealer .PERIOD a dutch art dealer named han ,COMMA van meegeren ,COMMA who sold him a wonderful vermeer for the cost of what would now be 10 million dollars .PERIOD he had a lesser charge of forgery got a year sentence and died a hero to the dutch people .PERIOD many sociologists like veblen and wolfe would argue that the reason why we take origins .PERIOD so seriously is because we're snobs because we're focused on status .PERIOD would you eat this few of you would eat it if it's a rat or a human .PERIOD it's simple ,COMMA you tell them they're from mcdonald's .PERIOD it's very simple ,COMMA pour it from an expensive bottle .PERIOD it will make a difference .PERIOD if they turn out to be much younger or much older than you think they are that drops the value of it suggesting that .PERIOD that's one reason why we like it ,COMMA rather .PERIOD it's because i want something that has a specific history who here likes the work of jackson pollock .PERIOD and the washington post reporter gene weingarten decided to enlist him for an audacious experiment .PERIOD so he got joshua bell to take his million dollar violin down to a washington dc subway station ,COMMA and stand in the corner and see how much money he would make .PERIOD he actually made 20 dollars more than that ,COMMA but he didn't count it .PERIOD so she's stunned that he's standing in a subway station .PERIOD one lovely experiment was done by kurt gray ,COMMA and dan wegner .PERIOD and what i hope to show is that unpicking dodgy claims unpicking .PERIOD the evidence behind dodgy claims isn't a kind of nasty ,COMMA carping activity .PERIOD it's socially useful ,COMMA but it's also an extremely valuable explanatory tool .PERIOD she it turns out has a non-accredited correspondence course ,COMMA phd a glass of red wine .PERIOD a day could help prevent breast cancer .PERIOD so i'm going to tell you about one trial ,COMMA which is probably the most well-reported trial in the uk news media over the past decade .PERIOD and this has been demonstrated in a whole raft of fascinating studies ,COMMA comparing one kind of placebo against another .PERIOD we know from three different studies on three different types of pain that a saltwater injection is a more effective treatment for pain than taking a sugar pill ,COMMA taking a dummy pill that has no medicine in it -- ,COMMA not because the injection or the pills do anything physically to the body ,COMMA but because an injection feels like a much more dramatic intervention .PERIOD but that's not enough .PERIOD what i find really fascinating is that the pharmaceutical industry uses exactly the same kinds of tricks and devices ,COMMA but slightly more sophisticated versions of them in order to distort the evidence that they give to doctors and patients ,COMMA and which we use to make vitally important decisions .PERIOD and it's a foregone conclusion .PERIOD if you give a drug at that high a dose that it will have more side effects ,COMMA and that your new drug will look better .PERIOD everybody wanted to show that their drug was better than risperidone .PERIOD so you see a bunch of trials comparing new antipsychotic drugs against risperidone at eight milligrams a day .PERIOD this is a drug called reboxetine around half of all of the trial .PERIOD data on antidepressants has been withheld ,COMMA but it goes way beyond that ,COMMA but the companies withheld that data from them .PERIOD and so did the european medicines agency for three years ,COMMA the infectious diseases .PERIOD cochrane group ,COMMA which are based in italy has been trying to get the full data in a usable form out of the drug companies so that they can make a full decision about whether this drug is effective or not .PERIOD and they've not been able to get that information .PERIOD this is undoubtedly the single biggest ,COMMA ethical problem facing medicine today .PERIOD thank you very much .PERIOD i saw people struggling to get by not knowing what was what ,COMMA and what was next .PERIOD you want a better life for yourself .PERIOD there's this thing ,COMMA this militarization of the world ,COMMA and it's centered right in the united states .PERIOD and the united states is responsible for almost one half of the world's military spending -- ,COMMA four percent of the world's population .PERIOD and you feel it you see it every day .PERIOD you say ,COMMA how is that possible and their leaders their leaders before they send their sons and daughters off to war in your country -- ?QUESTIONMARK and you know ,COMMA the reason -- before they send them off ,COMMA they go to a christian church ,COMMA and they pray to their christian god .PERIOD and they ask for protection and guidance from that god ,COMMA why they do wonderful things ,COMMA but they also do the bad things .PERIOD and you can't tell the difference .PERIOD and this guy ,COMMA you get a guy like lt gen william boykin ,COMMA and you're thinking god ,COMMA if this guy is saying that then all the soldiers must be saying that .PERIOD and this word here ,COMMA george bush called this war ,COMMA a crusade .PERIOD it's a holy war against muslims .PERIOD you feel frightened .PERIOD of course ,COMMA you feel frightened .PERIOD he wants to burn korans our holy book .PERIOD you don't know that so here .PERIOD and this is a perspective .PERIOD so here's what i want you to do .PERIOD i'm going out to defend your freedom ,COMMA your lives .PERIOD and if i can get you to step into their shoes and walk an inch ,COMMA one ,COMMA tiny inch ,COMMA then imagine the kind of sociological analysis that you can do in all other aspects of your life .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD it was only in the second half of the 20th century that we slowly began to pull ourselves out of this abyss .PERIOD you know ,COMMA in 1950 ,COMMA the typical ship carried 5000 to 10000 tons worth of goods .PERIOD today .PERIOD a container ship can carry 150000 tons .PERIOD it can be manned with a smaller crew and unloaded faster than ever before .PERIOD and i think ,COMMA as you'll see ,COMMA there's reasons for optimism ,COMMA because i believe that the best is yet to come well ,COMMA how else can we create new ideas ?QUESTIONMARK how else can we create new ideas ?QUESTIONMARK that is a good thing ?QUESTIONMARK how many ramanujans are there in india today ,COMMA toiling in the fields ,COMMA barely able to feed themselves when they could be feeding the world twenty-first century could easily be 33 ,COMMA even higher percent .PERIOD even at that rate ,COMMA by 2100 average gdp per capita in the world will be $200000 .PERIOD that's not that far ,COMMA but some of our grandchildren probably will what about a great depression .PERIOD now let's imagine that you were an economist in 1929 ,COMMA trying to forecast future growth for the united states ,COMMA not knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff ,COMMA not knowing that we were about to enter the greatest economic disaster .PERIOD certainly in the 20th century in the last 30 years ,COMMA thanks to explorations in remote parts of the world .PERIOD and advances in technology .PERIOD biologists have ,COMMA for example ,COMMA added a full one-third of the known frog and other amphibian species to bring the current total to 5400 and more continue to pour in two ,COMMA new kinds of whales have been discovered along with two new antelopes dozens of monkey species and a new kind of elephant -- ,COMMA and even a distinct kind of gorilla .PERIOD consider the nematode roundworm ,COMMA the most abundant of all animals ,COMMA but that number of bacteria species can be found in one gram of soil ,COMMA just a little handful of soil in the 10 billion bacteria .PERIOD that would be there .PERIOD my own epiphany ,COMMA as a conservationist came in 1953 ,COMMA while a harvard graduate student ,COMMA searching for rare ants found in the mountain forests of cuba ants that shine in the sunlight ,COMMA -- ,COMMA metallic green or metallic blue ,COMMA according to species and one species ,COMMA i discovered metallic gold and the final letter is ,COMMA o for over-harvesting ,COMMA -- ,COMMA driving species into extinction by excessive hunting and fishing that's in the united states .PERIOD but what excites me is that since i first put forward this particular idea in that form science has advanced .PERIOD i wish you would help them .PERIOD the encyclopedia will quickly pay for itself in practical applications .PERIOD the idea that in that room ,COMMA at that moment ,COMMA everyone regardless of their age ,COMMA their gender ,COMMA their race ,COMMA their color ,COMMA their religion comes together .PERIOD let's start with technology .PERIOD all right .PERIOD let's start with theater .PERIOD but the teachers came to me afterward and told me they hadn't seen the kids that attentive zero does not speak is neither man nor woman .PERIOD and that usually ,COMMA if you're a bit extraordinary ,COMMA if you're not exactly of human appearance ,COMMA then people will feel inclined to participate .PERIOD and to feel out loud ,COMMA i've worked as a doctor clown in a hospital for two years .PERIOD it's a human and technological revolution .PERIOD and well ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the dutch can't eat all these pigs .PERIOD and what i was curious about -- ,COMMA because historically ,COMMA the whole pig would be used up until the last bit .PERIOD so nothing would be wasted -- .PERIOD and i was curious to find out if this was actually still the case ,COMMA and in cheesecake and all kinds of desserts ,COMMA like chocolate ,COMMA mousse ,COMMA tiramisu ,COMMA vanilla ,COMMA pudding ,COMMA everything that's cooled in the supermarket .PERIOD there's gelatin to make it look good ,COMMA fine bone ,COMMA china ,COMMA -- .PERIOD this is a real classic .PERIOD i was not planning on showing you any meat ,COMMA because ,COMMA of course ,COMMA half the book's meat .PERIOD and you probably all know what meats they are .PERIOD and the reason for this is that pigs are actually quite close to human beings .PERIOD so the collagen is as well .PERIOD and they said ,COMMA well ,COMMA the director of the company decided not to let you borrow this heart valve because want his product to be associated with pigs .PERIOD well ,COMMA it is because everything that can't be used for anything else is made into a fuel that can be used as renewable energy source .PERIOD this is a picture of maurice druon ,COMMA the honorary perpetual secretary of l'academie francaise ,COMMA the french academy .PERIOD we see it in the constant appearance of slang and jargon of the historical change in languages in divergence of dialects and the formation of new languages .PERIOD the problem is which verbs go in which constructions ,COMMA a transitive verb mandates that there has to be an object there ,COMMA sam devoured the pizza .PERIOD you can't just say ,COMMA sam devoured .PERIOD there are dozens or scores of verbs of this type each of which shapes its sentence .PERIOD first ,COMMA there's a level of fine-grained ,COMMA conceptual structure ,COMMA which we automatically and unconsciously compute .PERIOD every time we produce or utter a sentence that governs our use of language ,COMMA or the meeting went from three to four in which we conceive of time as stretched along a line ,COMMA or rose forced herself to go as if there were two entities inside rose's ,COMMA head engaged in a tug of a war .PERIOD and i'll start out with a puzzle .PERIOD the puzzle of indirect speech acts .PERIOD for example ,COMMA in brotherhoods ,COMMA fraternal organizations ,COMMA sororities locutions ,COMMA like the family of man ,COMMA you try to get people who are not related to use the relationship type that would ordinarily be appropriate to close kin .PERIOD in that case ,COMMA the consequences are rather severe .PERIOD on the other hand ,COMMA if you extend the bribe ,COMMA if the officer is dishonest ,COMMA you get a huge payoff of going free .PERIOD the honest officer can't hold you to it as being a bribe .PERIOD and therefore you get the nuisance of the traffic ticket ,COMMA because i get to talk about one of my favorite critters ,COMMA which is the western grebe .PERIOD you haven't lived until you've seen these guys do their courtship dance .PERIOD what they said to us at first was ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we already do biomimicry .PERIOD and they said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA what happens is mineral -- just like at your house -- mineral builds up .PERIOD so if we had some way to stop this scaling -- ,COMMA and so i picked up some shells on the beach ,COMMA and i asked them what is scaling what's inside your pipes ?QUESTIONMARK and they didn't know that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's a silo people in silos .PERIOD they didn't know that the same thing was happening .PERIOD so one of them thought about it and said ,COMMA ok ,COMMA well ,COMMA if this is just crystallization ,COMMA that happens automatically out of seawater -- self-assembly -- .PERIOD then why aren't shells infinite in size ?QUESTIONMARK what stops the scaling ?QUESTIONMARK how do we redesign the world that we make the human-made world ?QUESTIONMARK and there's a lot of cool technologies out there that life has what's the syllabus .PERIOD and thirdly ,COMMA how does life make things disappear into systems ?QUESTIONMARK and at the same time ,COMMA i'm listening to a lot of businesses and finding what their sort of grand challenges are on the lower left .PERIOD there is a picture of mother of pearl forming out of seawater .PERIOD it's a layered structure that's mineral and then polymer .PERIOD and it makes it very ,COMMA very tough .PERIOD here are two organisms that pull water pulling water out of monterey fog and out of the sweaty air in atlanta before it gets into a building are key technologies .PERIOD green chemistry is replacing our industrial chemistry with nature's recipe book that little guy over there is a tardigrade .PERIOD there is a problem with vaccines around the world ,COMMA not getting to patients .PERIOD and the reason is that the refrigeration somehow gets broken .PERIOD what's called the cold chain gets broken .PERIOD they can be put in a glove compartment .PERIOD ok ,COMMA chris anderson :COLON talk about foreplay .PERIOD i -- ,COMMA we need to get to 12 ,COMMA but really quickly .PERIOD ok .PERIOD so that's the healing one .PERIOD and really ,COMMA that's what other organisms do as well .PERIOD that's the twelfth one .PERIOD and i saw from a young age that having a decent job and earning a good living made the biggest difference for families who were struggling .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA here was a girl who had never lived in peace time ,COMMA who somehow had come to sound like a candidate from the apprentice .PERIOD my first business was a dressmaking business .PERIOD i started under the taliban .PERIOD the imf official is hardly the only person to automatically file women under micro .PERIOD and in many places they're there because -- .PERIOD and i say this as somebody who worked in finance ,COMMA -- 500 billion dollars ,COMMA at least has gone into the emerging markets .PERIOD in the past decade ,COMMA just think of the benefits when it comes to jobs productivity employment child nutrition ,COMMA maternal mortality literacy and much much more and not one country in all the world has eliminated its economic participation gap -- ,COMMA not one .PERIOD the women in my family are not exceptions ,COMMA the women in this room and watching in la together ,COMMA we can make certain that the so-called exceptions begin to rule once upon a time in 19th century ,COMMA germany ,COMMA there was the book .PERIOD now ,COMMA during this time ,COMMA the book was the king of storytelling .PERIOD his name was lothar .PERIOD lothar meggendorfer ,COMMA this man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold whether storytellers realized it or not .PERIOD they were channeling meggendorfer's spirit .PERIOD when they moved opera to vaudville radio news to radio theater film to film in motion to film in sound ,COMMA color 3d on vhs and on dvd .PERIOD and i really want to build green .PERIOD but i'm very suspicious of all of these well-meaning articles people long on moral authority and short on data ,COMMA telling me how to do these kinds of things wipe it up ,COMMA throw it away unless i use a front-loading high-efficiency washing machine .PERIOD and then it looks a little bit better .PERIOD so what this says is that sometimes the things that you least expect -- the position in which you put the handle -- ,COMMA have a bigger effect than any of those other things that you were trying to optimize .PERIOD we wanted to know how much better we could do .PERIOD now ,COMMA pvc is a little bit better ,COMMA but still not as good as the wood that we chose when it comes time to sheetrock .PERIOD if you use ecorock ,COMMA it's about a quarter of the embodied energy of standard sheetrock .PERIOD if you put carpeting in your house ,COMMA it's about a tenth of the embodied energy of the entire house ,COMMA unless you use concrete or wood for a much lower embodied energy .PERIOD so now we add in the final construction energy .PERIOD we add it all up ,COMMA and we've built a house for less than half of the typical embodied energy for building a house like this .PERIOD now ,COMMA i probably would have upgraded the old house to be more energy-efficient .PERIOD and in that case ,COMMA it would take me more about 20 years to break even so what does this mean you might want to leave now ?QUESTIONMARK so i did ,COMMA and i'm talking specifically about synanthropic species ,COMMA which are species that have adapted specifically for human ecologies species like rats and cockroaches and crows .PERIOD so ,COMMA for example ,COMMA rats are incredibly responsive breeders .PERIOD we're seeing a population boom with crows .PERIOD and i'll give you an example of that .PERIOD and these crows use sticks in the wild to get insects and whatnot out of pieces of wood .PERIOD they messed up and left ,COMMA just a stick of wire in there .PERIOD so what's significant about this isn't that crows are using cars to crack nuts .PERIOD and as we heard yesterday ,COMMA that's the pandora's box that's getting human beings in trouble .PERIOD and we're starting to see it with them .PERIOD now they're used to the sound of the machine ,COMMA and they keep coming back and digging out these peanuts from amongst the pile of coins .PERIOD that's there .PERIOD the main thing .PERIOD the main point of all this for me is that we can find mutually beneficial systems for these species .PERIOD so my grandfather told me when i was a little girl ,COMMA if you say a word often enough ,COMMA it becomes you anybody out here old enough to know studs terkel that old radio man ,COMMA the gradual slippage -- 'slippage' is the word used by the people in watergate moral slippage -- .PERIOD it's a gradual kind of thing combination of things .PERIOD oh ,COMMA let me kind of tell you a funny little play bit .PERIOD just as a train is about to go a young couple rush in .PERIOD and they're just about to close the pneumatic doors .PERIOD you see ,COMMA here's huck .PERIOD he's an illiterate kid .PERIOD he's had no schooling ,COMMA but there's something in him .PERIOD you know ,COMMA most actors want to do characters that are likeable -- .PERIOD well ,COMMA not always ,COMMA but the notion ,COMMA especially at a conference like this .PERIOD i like to inspire people ,COMMA and i still feel as though i've got to get coffee for my male colleagues ,COMMA even though i've outlived most of them ,COMMA everything i do is word for word off a tape ,COMMA and it didn't work didn't work all around her .PERIOD head was just swollen her .PERIOD head was about two sizes of its own size .PERIOD he says ,COMMA 'she won't breathe' .PERIOD i knew immediately that she was dead .PERIOD i didn't even want to accept the fact that she was dead .PERIOD so i went in ,COMMA and i put a mirror to her mouth -- .PERIOD there was no thing .PERIOD nothing coming out of her mouth .PERIOD he said ,COMMA he said ,COMMA he said ,COMMA 'we can't .PERIOD we can't let nobody find out about this' .PERIOD he say ,COMMA 'you've got to help me' .PERIOD i agree ,COMMA i agree .PERIOD and so i went to both -- two race riots ,COMMA one of which was the los angeles riot .PERIOD and this next piece is from that ,COMMA and that trial came back with two cops going to jail and two cops declared innocent .PERIOD i was at that trial .PERIOD so what she's questioning here .PERIOD she's taking a chance and questioning what justice is in society .PERIOD we didn't qualify for medical treatment ,COMMA no food stamp ,COMMA no gr ,COMMA no welfare .PERIOD anything ,COMMA many african-americans who never work got minimum amount of money to survive .PERIOD we didn't get any because we have a car and a house .PERIOD and i wonder if that is really justice for them to get their rights in that way .PERIOD but after the riot it's too much difference .PERIOD the other reason that i don't wear shoes is just in case .PERIOD i really feel like i have to cuddle up and get into the feet of somebody walking ,COMMA really in somebody else's shoes .PERIOD i was in a doctor's office .PERIOD last cat scan .PERIOD and there was a reader's digest ,COMMA october 2002 .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA like even when i told my wife that you want to come out here and talk to me ,COMMA she's like 'she's just talking .PERIOD she's just being nice to you .PERIOD she's not going to do that' .PERIOD and then you called me up .PERIOD and you said ,COMMA you wanted to come out here and interview me .PERIOD and she went and looked you up on the internet .PERIOD she said ,COMMA 'look ,COMMA who she is freedom .PERIOD it would have to be the rodeo .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA i guess it just be like -- .PERIOD i guess it be like the day .PERIOD my brother died .PERIOD so check it .PERIOD i'm gonna to catch mockingbirds .PERIOD i'll get some asshole at a watering hole asking what brand the ice is .PERIOD i'll get the last time you lied .PERIOD i'll get a lonely little sentence with real error in it .PERIOD yeah ,COMMA i guess i could come inside ,COMMA but only for a minute .PERIOD what does a violin have to do with technology ?QUESTIONMARK the surface of the earth is absolutely riddled with holes .PERIOD and here we are right in the middle .PERIOD i'm on this 'til .PERIOD the whole thing spreads with chat rooms and copycats and moms ,COMMA maybe tucking kids into bed singing hush little baby .PERIOD don't say a word .PERIOD wow .PERIOD now ,COMMA most media companies -- television .PERIOD radio publishing games .PERIOD you name it -- .PERIOD they use very rigid ,COMMA segmentation methods in order to understand their audiences .PERIOD and so the bizarre result of this is that most of our popular culture is actually based on these presumptions about our demographics .PERIOD now there's something else that we've discovered about social media .PERIOD that's actually quite surprising .PERIOD well ,COMMA i actually don't think that's going to be the case .PERIOD this is far too simplistic .PERIOD so you may be asking ,COMMA well ,COMMA why is it important that i know what entertains people ?QUESTIONMARK so imagine a media atmosphere that isn't dominated by lame stereotypes about gender and other demographic characteristics .PERIOD thank you so much .PERIOD and she went to a neurologist ,COMMA who was fascinated .PERIOD and the amazing thing to me is that now you would think this woman would like have excellent oral hygiene .PERIOD i interviewed when i was working on the book .PERIOD i interviewed a woman who can think herself to orgasm .PERIOD it was remarkable .PERIOD it took about one minute ,COMMA and it is a fact that you can trigger spinal reflexes in dead .PERIOD people -- a certain kind of dead person ,COMMA a beating-heart cadaver .PERIOD obviously ,COMMA it wouldn't be as much fun for the person .PERIOD you know ,COMMA you can get cadavers .PERIOD if you work at a university ,COMMA according to 1930s marriage ,COMMA manual author .PERIOD theodoor van de velde ,COMMA a slight seminal ,COMMA odor can be detected on the breath of a woman within about an hour after sexual intercourse .PERIOD but he wrote in this book ,COMMA ideal marriage -- ,COMMA he said that he could differentiate between the semen of a young man ,COMMA which he said had a fresh ,COMMA exhilarating smell .PERIOD and the semen of mature men whose semen smelled quote .PERIOD remarkably ,COMMA like that of the flowers of the spanish chestnut .PERIOD and lo and behold ,COMMA the hiccups went away .PERIOD it was called the upsuck theory .PERIOD this is the 1950s .PERIOD i have an answer for you .PERIOD i have two answers .PERIOD so now you have an evolutionary excuse alrighty .PERIOD there is considerable evidence for upsuck in the animal kingdom ,COMMA -- pigs ,COMMA for instance .PERIOD and i also said to her now ,COMMA these sows ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA you may have noticed there .PERIOD the sow doesn't look to be in the throes of ecstasy .PERIOD this is the ejaculation face of the stump-tailed macaque .PERIOD this is basically a penis camera on a motor .PERIOD and in fact ,COMMA he found that in three quarters of the men ,COMMA the stuff just kind of slopped out ,COMMA and that furthers the isolation that people like john found themselves in .PERIOD but after having lost a beloved teacher in 2006 and a good friend last year to suicide and sitting last year at tedactive ,COMMA i knew that i needed to step out of my silence and past my taboos to talk about an idea worth spreading -- .PERIOD and that is that people who have made the difficult choice to come back to life need more resources and need our help .PERIOD this is the way that most of us were taught to tie our shoes .PERIOD and here's how to tell it will let you down less ,COMMA and not only that it looks better live long and prosper .PERIOD it's called tidying up art .PERIOD and it's as you can see ,COMMA it's more or less a picture book .PERIOD i'd like to show them around .PERIOD so we can just ,COMMA you know ,COMMA -- ,COMMA actually ,COMMA i managed to prepare for you some enlarged pictures ,COMMA -- even better .PERIOD and we can see here very clearly .PERIOD it's a confusion of color ,COMMA the various pictures here of the various elements of the picture .PERIOD -- .PERIOD the whole thing is unstructured .PERIOD yeah ,COMMA that's great .PERIOD you can see now .PERIOD that's a good example ,COMMA even behaving in an orderly ,COMMA systematic way can sometimes lead to complete chaos .PERIOD that's a picture by keith haring in the end .PERIOD one has a list with which one then can arrange tidying up rene magritte -- .PERIOD this is really fun like books ,COMMA clothes ,COMMA toothbrush ,COMMA etc .PERIOD and it was great .PERIOD but then one morning ,COMMA i hang the same little sign onto that picture by vincent van gogh here -- .PERIOD that's just my new proposal here for the union .PERIOD jack .PERIOD yeah ,COMMA i think after you have seen that i have to leave anyway .PERIOD one is hierarchical pores .PERIOD and the other is a macro-molecular nanoscale porosity in the material machines are becoming devastatingly capable of things like killing right ?QUESTIONMARK those machines have no place for empathy ,COMMA which was the basis of the movie bladerunner .PERIOD even if you just try to get all of those ideas into your head ,COMMA by watching all those thousand ted videos ,COMMA it would actually currently take you over 250 hours to do .PERIOD so each of those tedtalks has an average length of about 2300 words or living in existential vacuum .PERIOD it sucks .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA for example ,COMMA dan pink's talk on motivation ,COMMA which was pretty good .PERIOD if you haven't seen it ,COMMA drop carrot drop ,COMMA stick .PERIOD bring meaning .PERIOD even then ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA it's not possible to summarize each tedtalk individually .PERIOD i don't know any tedtalk that contains this .PERIOD i had started out with a thousand tedtalks ,COMMA and i had 600 six-word summaries for those .PERIOD so i thought i probably have to take this one step further here and create summaries of the summaries -- .PERIOD and this is exactly what i did .PERIOD so he's discovering the garden .PERIOD his face by the way is fully ai-driven .PERIOD now ,COMMA we need to have a bit more engagement .PERIOD and again ,COMMA what we can do is we can look at the body .PERIOD you stand up ,COMMA and you skim the stone ,COMMA and we're going to help him with this now .PERIOD but this is going to be an introduction .PERIOD and this is all about the deep psychology that we're trying to use .PERIOD we're trying to introduce you to what i believe is the most wonderful part .PERIOD you being able to talk in your natural voice to milo .PERIOD he's just moved house .PERIOD he's got no friends .PERIOD they're always getting stressed .PERIOD milo .PERIOD i just really miss my old house that's all .PERIOD but for me ,COMMA this is a wonderful opportunity where technology at last can be connected with where i am no longer restrained by the finger .PERIOD i hold in my hand -- as far as a computer game's concerned ,COMMA -- ,COMMA or by the blandness of not being noticed .PERIOD if you're watching a film or a book ,COMMA each of you possesses ,COMMA the most powerful dangerous and subversive trait that natural selection has ever devised .PERIOD i'm talking about your language ,COMMA of course ,COMMA because it allows you to implant a thought from your mind directly into someone else's mind .PERIOD and they can attempt to do the same to you without either of you having to perform surgery .PERIOD and just imagine the sense of wonder in a baby ,COMMA when it first discovers that merely by uttering a sound ,COMMA it can get objects to move across a room as if by magic ,COMMA and maybe even into its mouth .PERIOD and this cumulative cultural adaptation as anthropologists call .PERIOD this accumulation of ideas is responsible for everything around you in your bustling and teeming everyday lives .PERIOD and this is also true of some remote oceanic islands .PERIOD this remarkable image is not a map of the world .PERIOD he thought ,COMMA oh ,COMMA i can renovate the school .PERIOD she found a job .PERIOD she scouted for jobs for her classmates and her friends .PERIOD she not only changed her own dynamic .PERIOD she changed her household .PERIOD she changed her family her village .PERIOD and that is that the central moral challenge of this century is gender inequity .PERIOD so some of you may be thinking ,COMMA gosh ,COMMA that's hyperbole .PERIOD and you know ,COMMA it happens for several reasons .PERIOD there are three reasons why this is the case when you educate a girl ,COMMA she tends to have significantly fewer kids .PERIOD it's kind of like the dirty little secret of poverty ,COMMA which is that not only do poor people take in very little income ,COMMA but also the income that they take in .PERIOD they don't spend it very wisely .PERIOD and unfortunately ,COMMA most of that spending is done by men .PERIOD the last reason has to do with women being part of the solution .PERIOD not the problem .PERIOD he was speaking to an audience much like yourselves .PERIOD and that does not even include those that are trafficked within country borders ,COMMA which is a substantial portion .PERIOD she fought off the hyenas with that stick .PERIOD she's moved out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle .PERIOD let me tell you about saima .PERIOD and then when she had to transport all of the embroidery goods from the village to the marketplace ,COMMA she needed someone to help her do the transport .PERIOD so she hired her husband .PERIOD a few yards away was a failed chicken coop .PERIOD she never broke down .PERIOD so here's the cause join the movement .PERIOD you've all seen lots of articles on climate change .PERIOD and here's yet another new york times article just like every other darn one you've seen .PERIOD and we've accomplished close to zip .PERIOD and there are times you might like to do something quick .PERIOD can you shade some sunlight and effectively compensate for the added co2 and produce a climate sort of back to what it was originally ?QUESTIONMARK and the answer seems to be yes ,COMMA it just sunk below the surface .PERIOD we weren't allowed to speak about it .PERIOD and in fact ,COMMA he had some ideas to make them go away .PERIOD but let's say you have sunlight hitting some particle ,COMMA and it's unevenly heated .PERIOD so the side facing the sun is warmer .PERIOD the side away cooler .PERIOD and so you see a net force away from the sun ,COMMA because we have no way to agree about where to set the knobs .PERIOD we need a broader debate .PERIOD let's say that we don't do geo-engineering .PERIOD we do what we ought to do ,COMMA which is get serious about cutting emissions ,COMMA but i have a lot of reservations ,COMMA and it's time to begin thinking about it .PERIOD even if the reason we're thinking about it is to construct arguments for why we shouldn't do it and oddly ,COMMA the most notable letter of rejection i ever received came from walt disney world ,COMMA a seemingly innocuous site .PERIOD and i wanted to see the center with my own eyes .PERIOD but what i came away with is a photograph ,COMMA and it's just another place from which to observe ,COMMA and the understanding that there are no absolute all-knowing insiders in this context .PERIOD i'll just show you a few .PERIOD this is a cryopreservation unit ,COMMA and it holds the bodies of the wife and mother of cryonics pioneer robert ettinger who hoped to be awoken one day to extended life in good health with advancements in science and technology ,COMMA all for the cost of 35 thousand dollars for forever .PERIOD and in this ,COMMA i really wanted it to resemble an early still-life painting .PERIOD so i spent some time with the smells and items .PERIOD and the film was shot on 72 millimeter .PERIOD government-issue film .PERIOD i investigate photography's ability to blur truth and fiction and its

,COMMA ron was convicted of the rape and murder of a barmaid at a club and served 11 years of a death sentence .PERIOD ronald jones ,COMMA served eight years of a death sentence for rape and murder of a 28-year-old woman .PERIOD some people say this is because we have better diagnosis .PERIOD and more people are being found out .PERIOD for example ,COMMA these two show great growth in income .PERIOD absolutely flat happiness curves my field .PERIOD the field of psychology hasn't done a whole lot to help us move forward in understanding human happiness .PERIOD emotions are short-lived intense responses to challenge and to opportunity .PERIOD and each one of them allows us to click into alternate selves that tune in turn on drop out ,COMMA thoughts ,COMMA perceptions ,COMMA feelings and memories .PERIOD we've come away from the freudian gloom ,COMMA and people are now actively studying this .PERIOD absent from this list ,COMMA and absent from any discussions of happiness are happiness in another's happiness .PERIOD babies love the taste of sweet and hate the taste of bitter .PERIOD babies really are born with a lot of innate pleasures .PERIOD it turned out that it wasn't that .PERIOD it really is a system of motivation .PERIOD a system of wanting there is a profound need to belong .PERIOD but there are ways in which our evolutionary history can really trip us up .PERIOD so for example ,COMMA we have three systems that underlie reproduction ,COMMA because it's so important .PERIOD there's attachment ,COMMA which is oxytocin and the opiates ,COMMA which says ,COMMA this is a long-term bond .PERIOD so a person can be in a long term ,COMMA attachment become romantically infatuated with someone else and want to have sex with a third person .PERIOD so if you look at questions like this life satisfaction ,COMMA you see life satisfaction going up with each rung of income .PERIOD you see mental distress ,COMMA going up with lower income ,COMMA but the effect is relatively small .PERIOD and sure enough ,COMMA if you look at the kinds of values that come in ,COMMA you see wealth adventure ,COMMA achievement ,COMMA pleasure ,COMMA fun ,COMMA be respected before the change and much more post-materialist values after i had all kinds of rats .PERIOD mice hamsters ,COMMA gerbils squirrels growing up in a multicultural environment .PERIOD we had african students in the house ,COMMA and i learned about their stories .PERIOD so different backgrounds ,COMMA dependency on imported ,COMMA know-how goods ,COMMA services ,COMMA exuberant cultural diversity ,COMMA princess ,COMMA diana is announcing on tv that landmines form a structural barrier to any development ,COMMA which is really true ,COMMA and actually our product -- .PERIOD what you see here rats have been used since the '50s last century .PERIOD in all kinds of experiments ,COMMA rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species .PERIOD so in our common language dutch the name for tb ,COMMA it gets a click sound and comes for the food reward .PERIOD and by doing so very fast ,COMMA we can have like a second-line opinion to see which patients are positive ,COMMA which are negative just as an indication .PERIOD whereas a microscopist can process 40 samples in a day ,COMMA a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only .PERIOD but let's stick first to tuberculosis throughout last year ,COMMA we've been -- ,COMMA depending on which intervals you take -- .PERIOD we've been consistently increasing case ,COMMA detection rates in five hospitals in dar es salaam between 30 and 40 percent .PERIOD and there are simple things like ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds also to standardize the pellets ,COMMA the food rewards and to semi-automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people .PERIOD here is a first prototype of our camera rat ,COMMA which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on .PERIOD thank you very much .PERIOD so how do you go about studying the brain ?QUESTIONMARK now ,COMMA one recent discovery that has been made by researchers in italy in parma by giacomo rizzolatti .PERIOD and his colleagues is a group of neurons called mirror neurons ,COMMA which are on the front of the brain in the frontal lobes .PERIOD so here is a neuron that fires when i reach and grab something ,COMMA but it also fires when i watch joe reaching and grabbing something ,COMMA it's almost as though it's performing a virtual reality simulation of the other person's action .PERIOD for one thing ,COMMA they must be involved in things like imitation and emulation .PERIOD so how do you do imitation ?QUESTIONMARK why is imitation important ?QUESTIONMARK and i claim that what happened was the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system ,COMMA which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people's actions .PERIOD a human being a child can just watch its parent kill another polar bear and skin it and put the skin on its body fur on the body and learn it in one step .PERIOD what the polar bear took 100000 years to learn .PERIOD it can learn in five minutes ,COMMA maybe 10 minutes .PERIOD it emerges from our understanding of basic neuroscience ,COMMA for the longest time people have regarded ,COMMA science and humanities as being distinct .PERIOD pollen is a flower's way of making more flowers .PERIOD here is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen ,COMMA the little hole in the middle .PERIOD we'll come to a bit later ,COMMA but that's for the pollen tube to come out later on a very tiny tube .PERIOD so that's 20 micrometers across that pollen grain there .PERIOD it's also very biologically active as anyone with hay fever will understand .PERIOD and the reason for that is they've got to chuck out masses and masses of pollen to have any chance of the pollen reaching another plant of the same species .PERIOD again ,COMMA -- this time ,COMMA sycamore ,COMMA -- ,COMMA wind-dispersed cool ,COMMA pollen ,COMMA though ,COMMA remember that thing is just about 30 micrometers across .PERIOD now ,COMMA it's much more efficient .PERIOD if you can get insects to do your bidding ,COMMA the pollen has little barbs on it .PERIOD if we look that tells me that it's actually been fossilized this pollen ,COMMA isn't that cool ?QUESTIONMARK and this is where it gets interesting for forensics .PERIOD so not only does each type of pollen look different ,COMMA but each habitat has a different combination of plants .PERIOD this is some pollen embedded in a cotton shirt ,COMMA similar to the one that i'm wearing now .PERIOD and that is the 40 years that women have advocated .PERIOD we have effective therapies now ,COMMA why are more and more women dying of ischemic heart disease .PERIOD so in the wise 15 years ago ,COMMA we started out and said ,COMMA well ,COMMA wow ,COMMA there's a couple of key observations .PERIOD and we should probably follow up on .PERIOD that had recently published that when women have heart attacks and die ,COMMA compared to men who have heart attacks and die -- .PERIOD and again ,COMMA this is millions of people happening every day ,COMMA -- women in their fatty plaque -- .PERIOD and this is their coronary artery .PERIOD so the main blood supply going into the heart muscle .PERIOD -- women ,COMMA erode men .PERIOD explode ekg goes pbbrrhh .PERIOD so the doctors can see this hugely abnormal ekg .PERIOD so what do you think happens to these gals ?QUESTIONMARK so ,COMMA unlike the cat scans ,COMMA x-rays ,COMMA thalliums for women ,COMMA whose breast is in the way of looking at the heart ,COMMA every time ,COMMA we order something that has even a small amount of radiation .PERIOD we say ,COMMA do we really need that test ?QUESTIONMARK and those little red boxes are deaths .PERIOD one of the things that we say about all of this female physiology -- because again ,COMMA as much as we're talking about women and heart disease .PERIOD women do on average ,COMMA have better longevity than men .PERIOD -- is that unfolding the secrets of female physiology and understanding that is going to help men and women .PERIOD so we're 35 years behind women .PERIOD participate deb roy .PERIOD this moment and thousands of other moments special for us were captured in our home ,COMMA because in every room ,COMMA in the house ,COMMA if you looked up ,COMMA you'd see a camera and a microphone .PERIOD and if you looked down ,COMMA you'd get this bird's-eye view of the room .PERIOD this is my wife ,COMMA and i cooking ,COMMA breakfast in the kitchen .PERIOD and as we move through space and through time ,COMMA a very everyday pattern of life in the kitchen in order to convert this opaque ,COMMA 90000 hours of video into something that we could start to see ,COMMA we use motion analysis to pull out as we move through space and through time ,COMMA what we call space-time worms .PERIOD no video here .PERIOD so you can focus on the sound ,COMMA the acoustics of a new kind of trajectory gaga to water .PERIOD this is one of the first results that came out of our study a little over a year ago that really surprised us .PERIOD so it appears that all three primary caregivers -- myself ,COMMA my wife and our nanny -- were systematically .PERIOD and i would think subconsciously restructuring our language to meet him at the birth of a word and bring him gently into more complex language .PERIOD what about the visual context ?QUESTIONMARK and there's our nanny by the door .PERIOD and what we've done is use the word water to tag that moment that bit of activity ,COMMA three of the key people in this project ,COMMA philip decamp rony ,COMMA kubat and brandon .PERIOD roy are pictured here .PERIOD each of the links that you're seeing rendered here is an actual connection made between something someone said and a piece of content .PERIOD we call this a co-viewing clique ,COMMA a virtual living room ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA and there are fascinating dynamics at play .PERIOD so this person is a key link in connecting mass media and social media together .PERIOD come here .PERIOD oh ,COMMA boy and primary visual cortex .PERIOD sees just simple geometry ,COMMA just the simplest of shapes .PERIOD and this is the part of the brain that will recognize what something is .PERIOD you'd be activating the dorsal stream .PERIOD if you did that .PERIOD and it's the part that feels now we've augmented this and spatialized this information .PERIOD we make meaning by seeing by an act of visual interrogation .PERIOD this is a time-lapse view of it .PERIOD and this is an emerging set of technologies that use large-screen displays with intelligent calculation in the background to make the invisible visible .PERIOD you can see the three-light transom there with the eyebrow windows -- ,COMMA certainly an architectural antique headed to the landfill .PERIOD even the lockset is probably worth 200 dollars .PERIOD then looking up in the turret .PERIOD you see there are bulges and pokes and sags and so forth .PERIOD then on the can it says ,COMMA this is the famous budweiser beer .PERIOD we know of no other beer ,COMMA blah ,COMMA blah ,COMMA blah ,COMMA this little house .PERIOD here ,COMMA those branches there are made out of bois d'arc or osage ,COMMA orange .PERIOD and these pictures will keep scrolling as i talk a little bit .PERIOD that's one of those new chocolate cell phones .PERIOD it only rattles that expected pattern and unity of structural features .PERIOD on the one hand we have an apollonian perspective ,COMMA which is very crisp and premeditated and intellectualized and perfect .PERIOD the dionysian personality takes the picture and goes .PERIOD oops ,COMMA scratch ,COMMA dumpster .PERIOD and here's a story .PERIOD jim tulles :COLON one of the guys i trained ,COMMA i said ,COMMA jim .PERIOD it's time now jim .PERIOD now it's time you're the down .PERIOD oh ,COMMA good call tulles from now on .PERIOD you guys hit this pile first ,COMMA but once in a while you get access to the control room ,COMMA and then you can kind of mess with the dials ,COMMA how disgusting it's a pretty quick read .PERIOD but as soon as you walk in ,COMMA i go ,COMMA ooh spaghetti sauce there .PERIOD i feel that expectation .PERIOD and so i accommodate it ,COMMA and i'm living my life according to what you expect me to do wildebeests .PERIOD don't hang with lions because lions eat wildebeests .PERIOD and so you see this in junior high a lot on the bottom tier .PERIOD we have basic needs -- shelter ,COMMA clothing ,COMMA food ,COMMA water ,COMMA mating and so forth .PERIOD we can't even afford to eat anything except beans .PERIOD we're in trouble .PERIOD and it raises an existential question ,COMMA which is if i'm having this experience of complete connection and full consciousness .PERIOD why am i not visible in the photograph ?QUESTIONMARK and where is this time and place ?QUESTIONMARK this is a police photo .PERIOD that's actually my car .PERIOD i'm put on full life support .PERIOD and i have a massive stroke ,COMMA and my brain drops into a coma .PERIOD and this is how we began .PERIOD now ,COMMA you also continue to watch as consciousness evolved to the point that here in india ,COMMA in madhya pradesh ,COMMA there's one of the two oldest known pieces of rock art found while i was producing in los angeles ,COMMA i never thought about it for a second .PERIOD here's my brain .PERIOD and this person is particularly interesting .PERIOD the craniomandibular system is critical to that .PERIOD if that sounds like a very ,COMMA very strange thing to say and rather a bold statement ,COMMA -- ,COMMA how can the jaw affect the entire body -- ?QUESTIONMARK let me simply point out to you .PERIOD if i ask you tomorrow to put one grain of sand between your teeth and go for a nice long walk .PERIOD how far would you last before ?QUESTIONMARK you had to remove that grain of sand that tiny misalignment bear in mind .PERIOD there are no nerves in the teeth .PERIOD that's why the same between the before .PERIOD and after that ,COMMA this shows it's hard to see the difference .PERIOD this is an mri mra mrv ,COMMA a volumetric mri .PERIOD i've brought with me from southern california ,COMMA the fm device .PERIOD and when i came out of my coma ,COMMA i recognized my family ,COMMA but i didn't remember my own past .PERIOD and i whispered the good news through my broken jaw ,COMMA which was wired shut to my night nurse .PERIOD and during my time in coma ,COMMA she had been laid to rest in her hometown of phoenix .PERIOD you know ,COMMA when i heard simon's -- ,COMMA please sit down .PERIOD i just want to talk to him for a second -- .PERIOD when i read his book ,COMMA i went to la to meet him .PERIOD the thing that amazed me is the painstaking detail with which he has written every hospital .PERIOD he has been to every treatment .PERIOD he got every near-miss he had and how accidentally he stumbled upon innovations ,COMMA tell a little bit about what you're wearing on your leg ,COMMA because the chimpanzee would score half right .PERIOD if i gave them two bananas with sri lanka and turkey ,COMMA they would be right .PERIOD half of the cases i did also an unethical study of the professors of the karolinska institute -- that hands out the nobel prize in medicine .PERIOD and they are on par with the chimpanzee there .PERIOD well ,COMMA i first discovered that the textbook was tintin ,COMMA mainly .PERIOD and what do you mean with western world ?QUESTIONMARK i said and 1962 .PERIOD there was really a group of countries here that was industrialized countries ,COMMA and they had small families and long lives one dollar 10 dollars or 100 dollars per day .PERIOD there's a little hump here ,COMMA but there are people all the way we heard it in other forms ,COMMA and who are these ?QUESTIONMARK where are the different countries ?QUESTIONMARK i can show you africa .PERIOD the problem in the world was the poverty in asia .PERIOD and if i now let the world move forward ,COMMA you will see that while population increase there are hundreds of millions in asia ,COMMA getting out of poverty and some others getting into poverty .PERIOD and this is the pattern we have today .PERIOD i can go here ,COMMA and i can split sub-saharan africa into its countries .PERIOD and when it burst the size of its country bubble is the size of the population today .PERIOD we don't have to go to cuba to find a healthy country in latin america .PERIOD the richest 20 percent of ugandans are there .PERIOD and we started to write software ,COMMA which could link the data like this .PERIOD so i first went to copenhagen because i thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA maybe i could become a biochemist .PERIOD but i discovered biochemistry was very boring ,COMMA but wilkins ,COMMA you know ,COMMA thought dna was the best bet .PERIOD and he showed this x-ray photograph .PERIOD and there i met francis crick .PERIOD i went there without knowing him .PERIOD he was 35 .PERIOD i was 23 .PERIOD and within a day ,COMMA we had decided that maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of dna .PERIOD and the reason for doing so at the center of this photograph is linus pauling about six months before he proposed the alpha helical structure for proteins and in doing so he banished the man out on the right ,COMMA sir lawrence bragg ,COMMA who was the cavendish professor .PERIOD this is a photograph .PERIOD several years later ,COMMA when bragg had cause to smile ,COMMA and they had the wisdom to say ,COMMA no .PERIOD so he didn't have it ,COMMA but there was ones in the literature .PERIOD so this was ,COMMA you know ,COMMA unexpected from the world's -- -- .PERIOD and so it was held together by hydrogen bonds between phosphate groups .PERIOD and a month after we got the pauling manuscript -- .PERIOD i should say ,COMMA i took the manuscript to london and showed the people .PERIOD well ,COMMA we got the answer on the 28th ,COMMA february '53 .PERIOD so i changed the locations .PERIOD and then we found the base pairing .PERIOD and francis immediately said ,COMMA the chains run in absolute directions .PERIOD so we saw how genetic information is carried .PERIOD it didn't yield .PERIOD it didn't give good x-ray photographs .PERIOD it was really ,COMMA you know ,COMMA sort of a shitty time .PERIOD well ,COMMA at that time ,COMMA -- ,COMMA i should go back .PERIOD and then they learned how to read the letters for the code .PERIOD there's a chip there ,COMMA a conventional one ,COMMA then there's one made by a photolithography by a company in madison called nimblegen ,COMMA which is way ahead of affymetrix .PERIOD and we use their technique ,COMMA which is all of us have about 10 places in our genome ,COMMA where we've lost a gene or gained another one .PERIOD actually ,COMMA it's a really big idea ,COMMA and they were going to spend the rest of their lives ,COMMA usually in this iron lung to breathe for them .PERIOD and it happened so fast in the united states ,COMMA however ,COMMA that even just last month ,COMMA jon stewart said this ,COMMA jon stewart ,COMMA where is polio still active ?QUESTIONMARK they had come from thousands of miles away .PERIOD it doesn't survive in the environment hardly at all .PERIOD and we've got pretty good vaccines as i've just showed you .PERIOD so those are the kind of stakes that we're after .PERIOD so it was a massive effort .PERIOD we've had to create one of the largest social movements in history .PERIOD now ,COMMA giving the polio vaccine is simple .PERIOD now it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication ,COMMA -- more than 15 years ,COMMA much longer than it should have -- .PERIOD but once it was built ,COMMA the results were striking last year .PERIOD it was 1000 .PERIOD we should abandon this idea of eradication .PERIOD let's settle for control -- .PERIOD that's good enough .PERIOD umar was paralyzed for life as you probably can't see the detail here .PERIOD but this is his report card ,COMMA and you'll see he's got perfect scores .PERIOD but ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i'd love to be able to tell you that .PERIOD umar is a typical kid with polio these days ,COMMA but it's not true .PERIOD the new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had .PERIOD and we immediately started using this .PERIOD well ,COMMA in a couple of months ,COMMA we had to get it out of production .PERIOD and we didn't start with the easy places .PERIOD so this morning ,COMMA at about seven o'clock ,COMMA i decided that we'd try to drive chris and the production crew here berserk by downloading all of our data from india again ,COMMA so that you could see something that's just unfolding today ,COMMA which proves that the impossible is possible today marks exactly six months -- .PERIOD and for the first time in history ,COMMA not a single child has been paralyzed in uttar pradesh or bihar .PERIOD we have the chance to write an entirely new polio-free chapter in human history ,COMMA beverly joubert ,COMMA we are truly passionate about the african wilderness and protecting the african wilderness .PERIOD and so what we've done is we've focused on iconic cats .PERIOD but one of the things that science really lets us down on is that personality that individual personality that these animals have .PERIOD well ,COMMA we needn't have worried ,COMMA and we could only find this by pushing ourselves by going where no sane person should go -- ,COMMA not without some prompting by the way from beverly -- ,COMMA and just pushing the envelope going out there pushing our vehicle pushing ourselves .PERIOD we don't always get that right .PERIOD and on this particular day ,COMMA we seriously underestimated the depth .PERIOD but that's i think what this is all about is that these individuals have these personalities and characters sleep deprivation is extreme .PERIOD but for 10 years ,COMMA we tried to capture lions and elephants together -- and never ever managed until this particular night .PERIOD this elephant against overwhelming .PERIOD odds simply gives up hope .PERIOD but by the same token ,COMMA you can get your hope back again ,COMMA beverly sits on the one side where all her camera gear is .PERIOD and i'm on the other side where my space is these are precious to us these divides .PERIOD but when this little cub saw that i had vacated my seat and climbed to the back to get some camera gear .PERIOD she came in like a curious cat to come and investigate .PERIOD and of course ,COMMA we knew now that she was going to survive .PERIOD it was absolutely amazing when she picked it up to safety protecting it from the hyena .PERIOD but i have to tell you -- .PERIOD everybody always asks what happened to the baby baboon we had to deal with these individual personalities .PERIOD there's an immense amount of poaching as well .PERIOD and so possibly the same amount .PERIOD richard feynman ,COMMA compared the accuracy of quantum theories ,COMMA -- experimental predictions ,COMMA -- to specifying the width of north america to within one hair's breadth of accuracy .PERIOD and the familiar illustration is the nucleus of an atom is a fly in the middle of a sports stadium .PERIOD and the next atom is in the next sports stadium as an evolutionary biologist .PERIOD i'd say this our brains have evolved to help us survive within the orders of magnitude of size and speed ,COMMA which our bodies operate at .PERIOD we never evolved to navigate in the world of atoms ,COMMA moving to the other end of the scale .PERIOD our ancestors never had to navigate through the cosmos at speeds close to the speed of light .PERIOD if they had our brains would be much better at understanding einstein .PERIOD i want to give the name middle world to the medium-scaled environment in which we've evolved the ability to take act -- .PERIOD nothing to do with middle earth .PERIOD he stared at his wall in arlington virginia and decided to do it .PERIOD then general stubblebine banged ,COMMA his nose ,COMMA hard on the wall of his office stubblebine ,COMMA who commanded 16000 soldiers was confounded by his continual failure to walk through the wall .PERIOD i have every reason to think it's true .PERIOD i was reading playboy because i myself had an article in it .PERIOD and that's because in middle world ,COMMA air friction is always there .PERIOD we have this tendency to think that only solid material .PERIOD things are really things at all waves of electromagnetic fluctuation ,COMMA in a vacuum seem unreal ,COMMA steve grand points out that you and i are ourselves more like a wave than a permanent thing .PERIOD after all ,COMMA you really were there at the time .PERIOD weren't you not a single atom that is in your body today ,COMMA was there .PERIOD when that event took place matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you .PERIOD so really isn't a word that we should use with simple confidence .PERIOD the fact that the bat uses echoes in pitch darkness to input .PERIOD the current variables to its model while the swallow uses light is incidental .PERIOD haldane guesses that a dog would probably be able to place the acids in the order of their molecular weights by their smells .PERIOD just as a man could place a number of piano wires in the order of their lengths by means of their notes .PERIOD we're blind to all frequencies outside that ,COMMA unless we use instruments to help us one way to think about that is by counting planets .PERIOD in short ,COMMA when we're thinking like academics ,COMMA we regard people as elaborate and complicated machines like computers or cars .PERIOD but when we revert to being human ,COMMA we behave more like basil ,COMMA fawlty ,COMMA who we remember thrashed his car to teach it .PERIOD a lesson when it wouldn't start on gourmet night personification .PERIOD and the imputing of intentional purpose is such a brilliantly successful way to model humans .PERIOD it's hardly surprising the same modeling ,COMMA software often seizes control when we're trying to think about entities for which it's not appropriate ,COMMA like basil ,COMMA fawlty with his car ,COMMA or like millions of deluded people with the universe as a whole .PERIOD and so this basically led me to a subject called cymatics .PERIOD now cymatics is the process of visualizing sound by basically vibrating a medium ,COMMA such as sand or water as you can see there .PERIOD so what excites me about cymatics ?QUESTIONMARK it's like a looking glass into a hidden world .PERIOD we can also use cymatics for healing and education .PERIOD this image here is created from a snippet of beethoven's ninth

depressed and a little obsessional .PERIOD and i've always felt guilty about that .PERIOD i hope it happens to none of you ,COMMA but it will probably happen to a small percentage of you .PERIOD would you describe that as global citizenship ?QUESTIONMARK i believe the concept of global citizenship will simply grow out of people talking to each other across continents ,COMMA but people get excited about this idea of global citizenship .PERIOD but then they get confused a bit again ,COMMA when they start thinking about patriotism and how to combine these two ,COMMA when you actually look at the motor of the world economy ,COMMA it cannot move forward unless there is trade between the different countries .PERIOD well ,COMMA i think we can persuade people that what is necessary for britain's long-term interests .PERIOD what is necessary for america's long-term interests is proper engagement with the rest of the world and taking the action that is necessary .PERIOD and we have got to realize that if we don't link up with those people who are sensible voices and democratic voices in africa to work together for common causes .PERIOD then the danger of al qaeda and related groups ,COMMA making progress in africa is very big .PERIOD and i wouldn't like anything that is said today ,COMMA to suggest that i am diminishing the importance of the responsibility that each individual leader has for their own country .PERIOD where was the early warning systems ,COMMA all these things have happened .PERIOD even if as a human being ,COMMA you believe that you can't say that you're elected for britain's interests since then the world has moved forward ,COMMA partly as a result of what happened with the holocaust and people's concern about the rights of individuals within territories where they need protection ,COMMA partly because of what we saw in rwanda ,COMMA partly because of what we saw in bosnia ,COMMA the idea of the responsibility to protect all individuals ,COMMA who are in situations where they are at humanitarian risk is now being established as a principle ,COMMA which governs the world .PERIOD so while i can't automatically say that britain will rush to the aid of any citizen of any country in danger .PERIOD i can say that britain is in a position where we're working with other countries .PERIOD so that this idea that you have a responsibility to protect people who are victims of either genocide or humanitarian attack is something that is accepted by the whole world .PERIOD yes .PERIOD and then ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the theory is still that those talks get rent apart by different countries ,COMMA fighting over their own individual interests .PERIOD america has made its first disposition on this with the bill that president obama should be congratulated for getting through congress .PERIOD and god ,COMMA shook his head and said ,COMMA not this year ,COMMA not this decade ,COMMA perhaps not even in your lifetime .PERIOD and bill clinton walked away in tears ,COMMA because he had failed to get what he wanted .PERIOD so that's kind of a bold statement ,COMMA and it's technological .PERIOD so it can do things like microelectronics ,COMMA and maybe photonics do .PERIOD and the material looks something like this .PERIOD the process of discovery generally is inspired by nature .PERIOD they find their way to self-assemble .PERIOD and we can store information that's film with water and protein .PERIOD you can imagine that then maybe you can use a pure protein to guide light .PERIOD and so we've made optical fibers .PERIOD you can do electronic pieces that fold and wrap .PERIOD you can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted .PERIOD and you see there it gets reintegrated in tissue .PERIOD so you have a clock ,COMMA you have protein .PERIOD and now a silk cup like this can be thrown away without guilt .PERIOD -- ,COMMA unlike the polystyrene cups that unfortunately fill our landfills everyday .PERIOD so it allows for the recovery of what we've stored before some people in the last decade ,COMMA or two have started creating artwork with technology .PERIOD you can learn something from the robot about the community that you're in .PERIOD you guys are looking good out there data .PERIOD here's the first one .PERIOD one of them falls to the ground .PERIOD i can help you've been a great audience .PERIOD there's a lot more to come then .PERIOD he said ,COMMA but really sarah you could have worked harder .PERIOD can't you see ?QUESTIONMARK it's really too small indeed .PERIOD it's rather small one day ,COMMA while my father was working on a file for us to obtain french nationality .PERIOD i happened to see some documents that caught my attention .PERIOD these are real .PERIOD so his story ,COMMA my father was born in argentina ,COMMA this coincided with the time ,COMMA when he threw himself body and soul into chemistry ,COMMA because it was the only consolation for his sadness .PERIOD it was my grandfather who decided they needed false documents .PERIOD but it was he who went to meet a man from the resistance in those times documents had hard covers .PERIOD they were filled in by hand ,COMMA and they stated your job .PERIOD he started inventing all kind of things -- with some materials .PERIOD he invented a centrifuge using a bicycle wheel time passed .PERIOD and they thought he had surely forgotten them at first .PERIOD and then i understood that asking my father .PERIOD so many questions was stirring up a whole past .PERIOD he probably didn't feel like talking about because it was painful in africa .PERIOD there were countries fighting for their independence guinea .PERIOD guinea-bissau angola :COLON there was also latin america .PERIOD he said ,COMMA no ,COMMA we live on a human-dominated planet ,COMMA putting unprecedented pressure on the systems on earth .PERIOD this is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity in the global phase of sustainability .PERIOD so i thought i'd bring her with me today on stage to have her as a witness of a remarkable journey ,COMMA which humbly reminds us of the period of grace .PERIOD we've had over the past 10000 years here used as a proxy temperature variability .PERIOD it was a jumpy ride 80000 years back in a crisis .PERIOD we leave africa .PERIOD we colonize australia in another crisis ,COMMA 60000 years back .PERIOD we leave asia for europe in another crisis 40000 years back .PERIOD and then we enter the remarkably stable holocene phase the only period in the whole history of the planet that we know of that can support human development .PERIOD the majority of the planet aspiring for development ,COMMA having the right for development are in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle ,COMMA a momentous pressure .PERIOD now you would have wished the climate pressure to hit a strong planet a resilient planet .PERIOD but unfortunately ,COMMA the third pressure is the ecosystem decline .PERIOD now if we have evidence ,COMMA which we now have that wetlands forests ,COMMA [unclear] monsoon system ,COMMA the rainforests behave in this nonlinear way .PERIOD and could we even thanks to major advancements in earth systems science identify the thresholds ,COMMA the points where we may expect nonlinear change .PERIOD now ,COMMA this is the big bang ,COMMA equivalent then of human development within the safe ,COMMA operating space of the planetary boundaries in the '60s already through the green revolution .PERIOD and the haber-bosch process of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere -- ,COMMA you know ,COMMA human's today ,COMMA take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere than the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole .PERIOD there's good news here ,COMMA for example ,COMMA from latin america ,COMMA where plow-based farming systems of the '50s and '60s led farming ,COMMA basically to a dead-end with lower and lower yields degrading the organic matter and fundamental problems at the livelihood levels in paraguay ,COMMA uruguay .PERIOD and a number of countries ,COMMA brazil leading to innovation and entrepreneurship among farmers in partnership with scientists into an agricultural revolution of zero tillage systems combined with mulch farming with locally adapted technologies ,COMMA which today ,COMMA for example ,COMMA in some countries have led to a tremendous increase in area under mulch zero till farming ,COMMA which not only produces more food ,COMMA but also sequesters carbon .PERIOD it has to basically do this on current land ,COMMA elinor ostrom .PERIOD the latest nobel laureate of economics clearly shows empirically across the world that we can govern the commons .PERIOD if we invest in trust ,COMMA local action-based partnerships and cross-scale institutional innovations ,COMMA where local actors together can deal with the global commons at a large scale ,COMMA where you give the guaranteed price for investment in renewable energy ,COMMA but you can subsidize electricity to poor people .PERIOD so there is scientific evidence .PERIOD i was asked to come here and speak about creation .PERIOD you know ,COMMA creation is what put that dog in that picture and creativity is what makes us see a chicken on his hindquarters .PERIOD and another point -- .PERIOD why i'm here -- is that the day i went to pick up the plexiglas trophy .PERIOD i rented a tuxedo for the first time in my life ,COMMA picked the thing -- didn't have any friends .PERIOD somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles .PERIOD and that's how -- with this money .PERIOD i paid for a ticket to come to the united states in 1983 .PERIOD and that's very -- .PERIOD the basic reason i'm talking to you here today ,COMMA because i got shot ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA it has become obsolete because it was designed for atari platform ,COMMA but i was still ,COMMA you know ,COMMA -- .PERIOD this is a kitty cloud the snail .PERIOD and your eye doesn't know which level to read ,COMMA and they would look at it .PERIOD -- .PERIOD ah ,COMMA it's a pencil ,COMMA drawing .PERIOD it had a physicality .PERIOD and you start going deeper and deeper into sort of narrative that goes this way towards the image .PERIOD so this is monkey with leica ,COMMA and i wanted to deal with other subjects .PERIOD i got some photographs from them and jackson pollock .PERIOD also ,COMMA i used the dust at the whitney museum to render some pieces of their collection ,COMMA and i picked minimalist pieces because they're about specificity .PERIOD they do a dna scan of this .PERIOD they will come up with a great mailing list .PERIOD also the reference to gerhard richter's use of color charts -- .PERIOD and the idea also entering another realm of representation ,COMMA that's very common to us today ,COMMA which is the bit map .PERIOD i opt for very simple line drawings ,COMMA -- kind of stupid looking on the other hand .PERIOD you know ,COMMA i paid like three dollars .PERIOD i think -- .PERIOD and i went to a warehouse in queens to see a version of othello by an amateur group .PERIOD that's why we pay to go to magic shows and things like that .PERIOD and the information is there twice -- one on each strand -- ,COMMA which is important ,COMMA because when new cells are formed these strands come apart ,COMMA new strands are synthesized with the old ones as templates in an almost perfect process .PERIOD so an interesting question is what happened when we met ?QUESTIONMARK so this involves a lot of technical issues in how you extract the dna ,COMMA how you convert it to a form .PERIOD you can sequence the same is true .PERIOD if we look at a chinese individual versus an african ,COMMA the neanderthal will match the chinese individual more often .PERIOD and further back 800000 years ago ,COMMA is there a common origin with present day humans .PERIOD but we do find it in papua new guinea ,COMMA and in other islands in melanesia and the pacific .PERIOD we don't know quite where the borders between these people were .PERIOD but we know that in southern siberia ,COMMA there were both neanderthals and denisovans at least at some time in the past .PERIOD and since we mixed elsewhere ,COMMA i'm pretty sure that one day ,COMMA when we will ,COMMA perhaps have a genome of also these earlier forms in africa ,COMMA we will find that they have also mixed with early modern humans in africa .PERIOD and if i were to write a volume ,COMMA it would be called artists ,COMMA who have led my exhibitions ,COMMA because my work in understanding art and in understanding culture has come by following artists by looking at what artists mean and what they do ,COMMA and who they are my overall project is about art -- specifically about black artists ,COMMA -- ,COMMA very generally about the way in which art can change the way .PERIOD we think about culture and ourselves what that might mean for cultural movements all over this moment ,COMMA the me ,COMMA we seems incredibly prescient ,COMMA totally important to this end .PERIOD the specific project that has made this possible for me is a series of exhibitions all titled with an f ,COMMA -- freestyle ,COMMA frequency and flow -- ,COMMA which have set out to discover and define the young black artists working in this moment who i feel strongly will continue to work over the next many years .PERIOD it is really in this sense of discovery that i have a new set of questions that i'm asking .PERIOD but really ,COMMA it has been what i've discovered about myself .PERIOD and what i can offer in the space of an exhibition to talk about beauty to talk about power to talk about ourselves and to talk and speak to each other .PERIOD and you put on the t-10 parachute .PERIOD they give 20 minutes -- .PERIOD that's a time warning .PERIOD and that's to boost everybody's confidence to show that you're not scared .PERIOD then they give you get ready .PERIOD so nice air comes flowing in .PERIOD so then you look around ,COMMA you're under a canopy .PERIOD and you say ,COMMA this is good in 30-some years of jumping .PERIOD i never did one .PERIOD and i realized that if they had to go into combat ,COMMA they would do what we had taught them ,COMMA and they would follow leaders .PERIOD so now i do that tuesday morning jump ,COMMA but it's not any jump -- .PERIOD that was september 11th ,COMMA 2001 ,COMMA sort of leadership by humiliation .PERIOD i've got to use video teleconferences .PERIOD i've got to use chat .PERIOD i've got to use email .PERIOD i've got to use phone calls -- .PERIOD i've got to use everything .PERIOD i can not just for communication ,COMMA but for leadership .PERIOD and that's a new kind of leadership for me .PERIOD so we had to get complex intelligence together .PERIOD we had to line up the ability to act in reality ,COMMA much of the force .PERIOD i led looked exactly like you .PERIOD and so instead of giving orders you're now building consensus .PERIOD and you're building a sense of shared purpose .PERIOD it also produced something which i call an inversion of expertise ,COMMA because we had so many changes at the lower levels in technology and tactics and whatnot ,COMMA that suddenly the things that we grew up doing wasn't what the force was doing anymore .PERIOD and it's a brand new leadership challenge .PERIOD and every morning ,COMMA in the ranger ,COMMA regiment ,COMMA every ranger -- ,COMMA and there are more than 2000 of them .PERIOD -- says ,COMMA a six-stanza ranger creed .PERIOD and so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing .PERIOD that was my journey .PERIOD i came to believe that a leader isn't good because they're right ,COMMA they're good because they're willing to learn and to trust .PERIOD alex steffen .PERIOD and i founded worldchanging in late 2003 .PERIOD and since then we and our growing global team of contributors have documented the ever-expanding variety of solutions that are out there right now .PERIOD and on the near horizon ,COMMA as norwegian social scientist ,COMMA evelin lindner has observed .PERIOD pessimism is a luxury of good times in difficult times .PERIOD pessimism is a self-fulfilling self-inflicted death sentence ,COMMA community tools like text messaging that can tell you when pollen counts are up or smog levels are rising ,COMMA or a natural disaster is unfolding .PERIOD can give you the information you need to act in a timely fashion .PERIOD the political aspects of mobile phones can't be ignored either from text message swarms in korea ,COMMA helping to bring down a government to the blairwatch project in the uk ,COMMA keeping tabs on politicians ,COMMA who try to avoid the press .PERIOD now ,COMMA imagine a similar model for networking environmentalists .PERIOD imagine a web portal ,COMMA collecting recordings and evidence of what's happening to the planet ,COMMA putting news and data at the fingertips of people of all kinds from activists and researchers to businesspeople and political figures .PERIOD now ,COMMA just to be clear in this talk .PERIOD i'm using the name earth witness as part of the scenario ,COMMA simply as a shorthand for what this imaginary project could aspire to not to piggyback on the wonderful work of the witness organization .PERIOD earth witness would show us two worlds the world .PERIOD we're leaving behind and the world we're building for generations to come after this .PERIOD we noticed a couple of interesting things ,COMMA which you'll see make yourself understood to the computer ,COMMA and he couldn't travel .PERIOD so i went over there and all over india ,COMMA at the end of about two years ,COMMA children were beginning to google their homework .PERIOD they said ,COMMA yes ,COMMA we did .PERIOD so i said ,COMMA for two months ,COMMA you were looking at stuff .PERIOD you didn't understand .PERIOD it took me three years to publish that .PERIOD i said ,COMMA no use the method of the grandmother .PERIOD what is that ?QUESTIONMARK can you do that ?QUESTIONMARK again ?QUESTIONMARK can you show me some more' ?QUESTIONMARK she did that for two months ,COMMA the scores went up to 50 ,COMMA which is what the posh schools of new delhi with a trained .PERIOD biotechnology teacher were getting the first group -- ,COMMA the best ,COMMA one -- solved ,COMMA everything in 20 minutes ,COMMA the average score when i'd done it with the computers .PERIOD and the groups was 76 percent back .PERIOD at gateshead ,COMMA a 10-year-old girl gets into the heart of hinduism in 15 minutes ,COMMA you know stuff ,COMMA which i don't know anything about .PERIOD this is a sole in newcastle .PERIOD i started writing english questions on the blackboard .PERIOD so you know what's happened .PERIOD thanks .PERIOD i was too young unmarried .PERIOD i had no children didn't really know africa .PERIOD and besides my french was pitiful .PERIOD so then i went the whole american way with competitions team and individual completely failed .PERIOD but over time ,COMMA the women learnt to sell on their own way .PERIOD so blue blue ,COMMA everything became blue .PERIOD i think andrew pretty well covered that .PERIOD so i will move to the third point ,COMMA which is that markets alone also are not going to solve the problems of poverty .PERIOD both of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise ,COMMA and both of them ,COMMA because they're manufacturers create jobs directly and create incomes indirectly ,COMMA because they're in the malaria sector and africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year because of malaria .PERIOD and it's really time .PERIOD we start thinking more creatively about how they can be fused .PERIOD he was actually living in the kibera slums ,COMMA when his father called him and told him about artemisia and the value-add potential samuel's kids are in private school .PERIOD and he's starting to help other farmers in the area also go into artemisia production ,COMMA -- dignity ,COMMA being more important than wealth .PERIOD the next one ,COMMA many of you know ,COMMA and so from an enterprise perspective for africa ,COMMA and from a public health perspective ,COMMA these are real successes .PERIOD we can start building local distribution .PERIOD and actually it can cost the public sector ,COMMA much less one that people will pay different prices .PERIOD but the overwhelming number of people will come forth at one dollar per net and make a decision to buy it .PERIOD but what it takes is a commitment from all of us to essentially refuse trite assumptions ,COMMA get out of our ideological boxes .PERIOD and we came up with some parameters ,COMMA because you know ,COMMA building a rube goldberg machine has limitations ,COMMA but it also is pretty wide open .PERIOD okay .PERIOD so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect of those 85 takes only three actually successfully completed their run .PERIOD and the wonderful elation that we had when we finally completed it ,COMMA it think we can do better than this .PERIOD hello tedxusc .PERIOD let me start again ,COMMA where it goes in the future is questioned .PERIOD so that's the human part .PERIOD and in that 15 percent ,COMMA the main focus is on human mind ,COMMA thinking skills ,COMMA somehow trying to unleash kids from the straightjacket of school ,COMMA which is putting information and dogma into them get them .PERIOD so they really think ask tough questions ,COMMA argue about serious subjects .PERIOD don't believe everything .PERIOD that's in the book ,COMMA think broadly or creative ,COMMA they can be .PERIOD here's a giant flying replica of a pterosaur that has no tail .PERIOD this was the full size of the original creature .PERIOD it sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator .PERIOD buckminster fuller said it .PERIOD clearly there are no passengers on spaceship earth only crew .PERIOD we the crew can and must do more with less -- much less .PERIOD it's amazing just on the puny power of the sun -- by having a super lightweight plane ,COMMA you're able to get it up there .PERIOD we couldn't bring one here to fly it and show you .PERIOD but there's a lot of technology going sorry .PERIOD it never makes a mistake .PERIOD because if you make a mistake ,COMMA you don't leave any progeny in concluding .PERIOD i want to get back to the big picture .PERIOD and i have just two final slides to try and put it in perspective .PERIOD and so i just put robotic and natural cockroaches out there ,COMMA but you can fill in whatever you want .PERIOD this is not a forecast last night .PERIOD we gave it a few too many turns .PERIOD and it tried to bash the roof out also .PERIOD it's about a gram .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD and despite their ferocious appearance tasmanian devils are actually quite adorable little animals .PERIOD but inevitably these tumors progress towards being enormous ulcerating tumors like this one here ,COMMA they were too young to survive without their mother .PERIOD scientists around the world were intrigued by this cancer ,COMMA this infectious cancer that was spreading through the tasmanian devil population .PERIOD i myself had a tumor removed from my large intestine .PERIOD when i was only 14 ,COMMA paradoxically ,COMMA once established natural selection actually favors the continued growth of cancer .PERIOD so cancer could be thought of as a strange short-lived .PERIOD self-destructive life form -- an evolutionary dead end .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA more genetic profiling told us that this tumor in jonas actually probably first arose from the cells of a female tasmanian devil -- .PERIOD and jonas was clearly a male .PERIOD so ,COMMA how come a tumor that arose from the cells of another individual is growing on jonas' face ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA the next breakthrough came from studying hundreds of tasmanian devil cancers from all around tasmania .PERIOD they tend to bite each other often quite ferociously and usually on the face .PERIOD but if this can happen in tasmanian devils ,COMMA why hasn't it happened in other animals or even humans ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA the answer is it has she took him to the vet ,COMMA and the vet discovered something quite disgusting .PERIOD so we've seen that this can happen in animals ad .PERIOD he decided to put this to the test by actually deliberately inoculating people with cancer from somebody else .PERIOD most of the people that dr southam injected did not go on to develop cancer from the injected cells .PERIOD and i think that this is something that oncologists and epidemiologists should be aware of in the future .PERIOD why has the record been so poor ?QUESTIONMARK because after years of stagnation and decline ,COMMA the mentality of politics is that it's a zero-sum game .PERIOD the security council typically has the responsibility for providing the peacekeepers who build the security .PERIOD it does increase security .PERIOD one is jobs now that is difficult .PERIOD so we need to encourage the growth of local firms ,COMMA and it's schizophrenic ,COMMA because in their hearts ,COMMA donors know ,COMMA that's not a realistic agenda .PERIOD and so what they also do is the total bypass ,COMMA just fund ngos ,COMMA it's to split the functions of a monopoly line ,COMMA ministry up into three .PERIOD so they wouldn't be provided thanks to the united states ,COMMA government and some ngo .PERIOD and basically what i'd like to tell you is that power is changing .PERIOD and there are two types of changes .PERIOD i want to discuss what we're going to see in the 21st century is asia ,COMMA gradually returning to being more than half of the world's population and more than half of the world's product .PERIOD it's not just prevailing at war ,COMMA though ,COMMA war still persists .PERIOD if we try to focus on the reality ,COMMA then what we need to focus on is what's really happening in terms of china and the united states ,COMMA and that the chinese won't catch up or pass the americans until somewhere in the latter part .PERIOD after 2050 of this century ,COMMA why does it matter who cares the answer is it matters quite a lot .PERIOD so empowering china to deal with its own problems of carbon is good for everybody .PERIOD and it's not a zero sum .PERIOD i win ,COMMA you lose .PERIOD how do we define our national interests so that it's not just zero sum ,COMMA but positive sum .PERIOD the world has a new mania ,COMMA a mania for learning english .PERIOD t ,COMMA i don't want to let myself down .PERIOD t ,COMMA perfect s :COLON perfect .PERIOD s :COLON i want to change my life .PERIOD so is english mania :COLON good or bad .PERIOD and now english is becoming the language of problem-solving .PERIOD it's a true feeling .PERIOD why is this old table in your office ?QUESTIONMARK and as i grew up ,COMMA i heard so much knowledge and so many insights and so much wisdom come out around this table .PERIOD i began to call it the wisdom table ,COMMA and i was so shocked .PERIOD so stunned .PERIOD i got up and said ,COMMA well ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD but what do i do ?QUESTIONMARK and that question cleared the space .PERIOD this film is called world peace and other 4th grade achievements .PERIOD and it's a beautiful thing ,COMMA and i saw miss ethel .PERIOD j banks who wore pearls and high-heels to elementary school every day .PERIOD and i'm not even talking about you behind me ,COMMA because i've got eyes in the back of my head .PERIOD and really ,COMMA i feel as though ,COMMA when i see the film -- ,COMMA i have a gesture .PERIOD she does like this -- .PERIOD i feel like i am a continuation of her gesture .PERIOD and so this world peace game .PERIOD i'd like to tell you about .PERIOD i didn't want to lecture or have just book reading .PERIOD i offer them the job .PERIOD they can turn it down ,COMMA and then they choose their own cabinet .PERIOD that's not all .PERIOD i throw them into this complex matrix .PERIOD and they trust me ,COMMA because we have a deep rich relationship together .PERIOD there's oil spills environmental disasters ,COMMA water rights disputes ,COMMA breakaway ,COMMA republics famine .PERIOD endangered species and global warming .PERIOD i have no chance to make any policy whatsoever once they start playing .PERIOD and because i don't know they've got to dig up the answer my question to you is who's in charge of that classroom .PERIOD and we were very upset .PERIOD i could not have designed that in teaching it .PERIOD it'll be more realer .PERIOD if she reads it ,COMMA we have a lot of data .PERIOD but i think sometimes we go beyond data with the real truth of what's going on .PERIOD and there are three seconds left on the clock .PERIOD i joined telco ,COMMA made tata trucks pretty close to pune .PERIOD so i took one year off ,COMMA and i went to this village science program .PERIOD this square might look very square and prim ,COMMA but give a child a triangle .PERIOD he can't do a thing to it .PERIOD they always make a triangular roof .PERIOD now ,COMMA this is people science .PERIOD the insects are eaten by the frogs .PERIOD the frogs are eaten by the snakes ,COMMA the snakes are eaten by the eagles ,COMMA and you put a little fan here .PERIOD and this is a hundred-year-old toy .PERIOD i just put this inside this .PERIOD the most expensive thing is the battery inside this .PERIOD this is an old bicycle tube ,COMMA which gives you a broad rubber band ,COMMA two safety pins .PERIOD it's the interaction of both these magnets ,COMMA which makes this motor spin .PERIOD there are six layers -- ,COMMA three layers of plastic aluminum -- ,COMMA which are are sealed together .PERIOD i'm going to keep this outside to blow out .PERIOD i'm going to suck in air .PERIOD well before i go any further ,COMMA this is something worth sharing .PERIOD if i crank the handle ,COMMA all the wool goes inside .PERIOD there are 12 million blind children in our country -- ,COMMA who live in a world of darkness .PERIOD when first you see nehru and gandhi ,COMMA this is the nehru cap -- just half a newspaper .PERIOD and the second night he would take the same cap and give it another fold .PERIOD and there's a third one over here .PERIOD firstly ,COMMA radical increases in resource efficiency .PERIOD and for all three of these ,COMMA i believe biomimicry has a lot of the solutions that we're going to need .PERIOD and i'm just going to talk through this animation ,COMMA and just as natural systems tend to increase in diversity and resilience over time .PERIOD there's a real sense with this project that the number of possibilities just continue increasing ,COMMA and the kind of elements i'm talking about are .PERIOD firstly ,COMMA we have a restaurant inside a productive greenhouse a bit like this one in amsterdam called de kas .PERIOD so for instance ,COMMA when julius caesar arrived in north africa ,COMMA huge areas of north africa were covered in cedar and cypress forests .PERIOD the converse is also true .PERIOD the more vegetation .PERIOD we lose the more that's likely to exacerbate climate change and lead to further ,COMMA desertification the way it does .PERIOD this is it comes out at night crawls to the top of a sand dune .PERIOD and because it's got a matte black shell is able to radiate heat out to the night sky and become slightly cooler than its surroundings .PERIOD and the ingenuity ,COMMA if you could call it that goes even further between them ,COMMA there's a waxy finish which repels water .PERIOD we're working with the guy who invented the seawater greenhouse .PERIOD this is a greenhouse designed for arid coastal regions .PERIOD and the way it works is that you have this whole wall of evaporator grills ,COMMA and you trickle seawater over that .PERIOD so that wind blows through ,COMMA it picks up a lot of moisture and is cooled in the process .PERIOD and what they found with the first seawater greenhouse that was built ,COMMA was it was producing slightly more freshwater than it needed for the plants inside .PERIOD and when you think about nature ,COMMA often you think about it as being all about competition ,COMMA you think ,COMMA what can i add to the system to create more value ?QUESTIONMARK and it turns out that different things crystallize out at different stages .PERIOD now ,COMMA we would be able to make use of all that waste brine .PERIOD we could evaporate it to enhance the restorative benefits and capture the salts transforming an urgent waste problem into a big opportunity ,COMMA far too much of the talk about the environment uses very negative language .PERIOD and this is an important point there are very few doctors .PERIOD and quite frankly ,COMMA these countries do not have the resources that are needed to cope with such epidemics very simple .PERIOD and knowing that starts to explain a lot of long-standing mysteries in science ,COMMA it also brings up new issues ,COMMA though ,COMMA like computational irreducibility ,COMMA you know ,COMMA in working on this science for many years ,COMMA i kept wondering what will be its first killer app .PERIOD let's start off with something really easy .PERIOD and it should be able to tell us that let's say the revenue of microsoft .PERIOD well ,COMMA even starting from mathematica ,COMMA this is still a huge amount of work .PERIOD well ,COMMA a crucial idea of wolfram alpha is that you can just ask it questions using ordinary human language ,COMMA which means that we've got to be able to take all those strange utterances that people type into the input field and understand them .PERIOD and i must say that i thought that step might just be plain impossible right now ,COMMA if we look at web queries ,COMMA more than 80 percent of them ,COMMA get handled successfully the first time .PERIOD and when one does that one really changes the economics of delivering computational things ,COMMA whether it's on the web or elsewhere ,COMMA i'll show you one example here ,COMMA something like rule 30 .PERIOD for example ,COMMA turns out to be a really good randomness generator .PERIOD so could that be what's going on with our whole universe ?QUESTIONMARK but in at least a large class of cases ,COMMA one can think of the universe as being like some kind of network ,COMMA which when it gets big enough behaves like continuous space in much the same way as having lots of molecules can behave like a continuous fluid .PERIOD actually ,COMMA i haven't shown these before .PERIOD but here are a few of the candidate universes that i've looked at benoit mandelbrot is in the audience .PERIOD we've questioned the future of capitalism .PERIOD and the idea is a simple simple idea ,COMMA which is the fact that the consumer has moved from a state of anxiety to action .PERIOD the consumer is empowered .PERIOD do you know what this was right here ?QUESTIONMARK and what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we are actually stepping forth ,COMMA and basically leveraging future education future children in our households .PERIOD however ,COMMA consumers have moved dentists report molars ,COMMA you know ,COMMA people grinding their teeth coming in and reporting the fact that they've had stress ,COMMA but seriously ,COMMA what we see happening .PERIOD and the reason i want to stress that the consumer is not in retreat is that this is a tremendous opportunity for the consumer who drove us into this recession to lead us right back out .PERIOD we see high-end haggling in fashion today ,COMMA so from a value and values standpoint ,COMMA what companies can do is connect in lots of different ways .PERIOD gore-tex is all about personal accountability of their management ,COMMA and their employees to the point where they really kind of shun .PERIOD the idea of bosses ,COMMA the third of the four laws of post-crisis consumerism is about durable living .PERIOD i was fascinated to learn that 30 percent of all homes in america are actually built by owners .PERIOD let's look at a couple of quick examples .PERIOD you need to harness it .PERIOD you need to give it meaning .PERIOD this kogi doesn't exist .PERIOD it's a moving truck ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK or you look at johnson &amp johnson's momversations .PERIOD you see this rising force in sort of total transparency ,COMMA and openness that companies are starting to adopt all ,COMMA because the consumer is demanding it .PERIOD but at the same time ,COMMA this is also a tremendous opportunity .PERIOD so i decided to investigate so i'm going to challenge all of you .PERIOD we talk about world peace ,COMMA and i want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands ,COMMA great ,COMMA mothers ,COMMA friends ,COMMA daughters sons ,COMMA that's what i do in life .PERIOD -- telling stories ,COMMA writing novels ,COMMA -- .PERIOD and today i would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling ,COMMA and also some supernatural creatures called the djinni .PERIOD i was born in strasbourg france to turkish parents .PERIOD in response .PERIOD she said ,COMMA yes ,COMMA praying is effective ,COMMA but also beware of the power of circles .PERIOD we all do our friends ,COMMA neighbors ,COMMA colleagues ,COMMA family -- .PERIOD if all the people in our inner circle ,COMMA resemble us ,COMMA it means we are surrounded with our mirror image .PERIOD instead it generated an atmosphere in which each child was seen -- ,COMMA not as an individual on his own .PERIOD but as the representative of something larger ,COMMA i came to learn that these were the three main stereotypes about my country ,COMMA politics ,COMMA cigarettes .PERIOD and the veil ,COMMA i lived in a very vibrant diverse neighborhood ,COMMA where i wrote several of my novels .PERIOD what i experienced as a child in that school ,COMMA in madrid ,COMMA is happening in the literary world today .PERIOD meanwhile ,COMMA the other leg draws a wide circle constantly moving .PERIOD we see them as the domain of supernatural creatures ,COMMA like the djinn who are made of smokeless fire and are the symbol of elusiveness .PERIOD perhaps that's not the right way to start at all .PERIOD you see there .PERIOD it's about 620 billion a year r&ampd in total in the economy ,COMMA publicly funded is about 06 percent of gdp .PERIOD the first thing i want to say ,COMMA and this is straight from wonders of the solar system is that our exploration of the solar system .PERIOD and the universe has shown us that it is indescribably beautiful .PERIOD so ,COMMA tiny moon that's fascinating and beautiful in itself .PERIOD but we think that the mechanism for powering those fountains requires there to be lakes of liquid water beneath the surface of this moon .PERIOD and what's important about that is that on our planet on earth ,COMMA wherever we find liquid water ,COMMA we find life tremendous and beautiful discovery .PERIOD and they saw strange pictures like this .PERIOD it's called helios -- helios from the sun .PERIOD that's a type ia supernova explosion .PERIOD it sits there about say 13 times the mass of the sun .PERIOD i think that's a remarkable demonstration of the power and beauty and universality of the laws of physics ,COMMA because we understand that process ,COMMA because we understand the structure of atoms here on earth .PERIOD and if i blow it up there ,COMMA you see it ,COMMA but it visited jupiter ,COMMA saturn ,COMMA uranus and neptune .PERIOD you could have made it in the 1890s .PERIOD you wouldn't have the transistor .PERIOD let me leave the last words to someone who's rapidly becoming a hero of mine humphrey davy ,COMMA who did his science at the turn of the 19th century .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD streets have names .PERIOD blocks are just the unnamed spaces in between streets .PERIOD they say ,COMMA oh well that's block 17 .PERIOD and this is block 16 .PERIOD just look at google maps .PERIOD here .PERIOD there's block 14 .PERIOD 15 ,COMMA 16 ,COMMA 17 ,COMMA 18 19 ,COMMA you say ,COMMA ok ,COMMA but walking around the neighborhood .PERIOD i noticed that the house numbers don't go in order .PERIOD it's a phenomenon on the internet today ,COMMA called behavioral tracking .PERIOD and it is very big business ,COMMA our daughter ,COMMA then joined us at the breakfast table .PERIOD and i asked her ,COMMA is there an emphasis on music literacy in your school ?QUESTIONMARK i go to work .PERIOD i check email .PERIOD i log onto a few more social sites .PERIOD i blog .PERIOD i check more news reports .PERIOD i share some of those news reports .PERIOD i go .PERIOD look at some videos ,COMMA pretty typical day -- in this case ,COMMA actually ,COMMA fairly pedantic -- .PERIOD and at the end of the day ,COMMA as my day winds down ,COMMA look at my profile and i’d say ,COMMA well ,COMMA i’m walking for the environment ,COMMA i called my parents up .PERIOD and so i did it’s only 500 miles .PERIOD i had written the university of montana two years earlier and said ,COMMA i'd like to go to school there .PERIOD but i use that story ,COMMA because they really wanted to help me .PERIOD i had 13 students when i first walked into the class ,COMMA i could see they were looking for the schedule to see when they could get out .PERIOD they had to take that class with me and on earth day 1990 -- ,COMMA the 20th anniversary of earth day -- that’s .PERIOD when i began to speak ,COMMA i got on a sailboat ,COMMA and i sailed down to the caribbean and walked through all of the islands and to venezuela .PERIOD and i got to -- .PERIOD i start saying free at last -- .PERIOD thank god .PERIOD almighty i’m ,COMMA free .PERIOD at last ,COMMA i had no idea .PERIOD i was going to become a un ambassador .PERIOD i was going to have to change .PERIOD i know i needed to change because it would be the only way that i could be here today .PERIOD when does learning begin well today ,COMMA i want to present to you an idea that may be surprising and may even seem implausible ,COMMA but which is supported by the latest evidence from psychology and biology .PERIOD now i'm a science reporter .PERIOD i write books and magazine articles the flavors of the food .PERIOD a pregnant woman eats find their way into the amniotic fluid ,COMMA which is continuously swallowed by the fetus .PERIOD what this means is that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers about what is safe and good to eat the pregnant woman's diet and stress level in particular ,COMMA provide important clues to prevailing conditions ,COMMA like a finger lifted to the wind ,COMMA the hunger winter as it came to be known killed .PERIOD some 10000 people and weakened thousands more learning is one of life's most essential activities .PERIOD and it begins much earlier than we ever imagined .PERIOD you'd still have five billion left in change .PERIOD and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down .PERIOD now years .PERIOD after you remember the strategic question of whether you're flying in a 777 or an airbus ,COMMA you remember those words and that experience .PERIOD i mean it could almost be rather like that scene from the film airplane .PERIOD i spoke about this before ,COMMA and a brilliant person got in touch with me and said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA what can you do one of them also being ,COMMA although logically ,COMMA it's quite a good idea to have a lift with no up and down button in it .PERIOD if it only serves two floors ,COMMA it's actually bloody terrifying .PERIOD okay ,COMMA they said ,COMMA can we do an advertising campaign ?QUESTIONMARK i said ,COMMA it's really really easy .PERIOD now interesting that no single person does that ,COMMA or at least can admit to being so anal as to do it moving over .PERIOD we come of course to consultancy .PERIOD i mean tiger ,COMMA surely was actually obeying the accenture model .PERIOD that's why i call for the chief detail officer .PERIOD but as i was moving away from the traditional classical repertoire and trying to find new ways of musical expression .PERIOD i realized that with today's technological resources ,COMMA there's no reason to limit ,COMMA what can be produced at one time from a single string instrument .PERIOD but what actually interests me a lot more is ,COMMA the fact that in the tip of each controller is a relatively high-performing ,COMMA infrared camera .PERIOD and i also was taught coupled with that that it was my job -- ,COMMA this classroom full of five and six year-old children -- .PERIOD it was our job apparently to help .PERIOD this is what jesus asked of us that was news to me .PERIOD and it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in .PERIOD and i felt overwhelmed ,COMMA and i didn't know what would happen when i ran out of things to give ,COMMA especially if the problem was never going away .PERIOD i heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor .PERIOD i started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth ,COMMA because i wasn't doing more apparently to make things better .PERIOD it became a transaction for me became sort of a trade .PERIOD so i spent three months in kenya ,COMMA uganda and tanzania ,COMMA interviewing entrepreneurs that had received 100 dollars to start or grow a business .PERIOD i was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories .PERIOD but there were these beautiful details ,COMMA even if i talked to 20 goat herders in a row and some days ,COMMA that's what happened -- ,COMMA these beautiful details of life change that were meaningful to them .PERIOD i never once was asked for a donation which had kind of been my mode ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK we sent it over to uganda when you lend them money ,COMMA and they slowly pay you back over time .PERIOD you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue .PERIOD so the mapping of participating in the story ,COMMA it actually flows with the up and down .PERIOD we make it really ,COMMA really simple for me as well as anyone else ,COMMA who wants to use the site .PERIOD but the good news is ,COMMA i don't think i need to stand here and convince you to care -- .PERIOD i'm not even going to try .PERIOD and i'm grateful that whenever i do that guaranteed ,COMMA i am inspired -- .PERIOD i am inspired by the person .PERIOD i am listening to what is the future of the human race ,COMMA if not what created the universe .PERIOD first ,COMMA there were the laws like maxwell's equations and general relativity that determined the evolution of the universe ,COMMA given its state over all of space at one time .PERIOD however ,COMMA this division into laws of evolution and initial conditions depends on time and space being separate and distinct .PERIOD indeed ,COMMA it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue the quest for knowledge .PERIOD professor hawking :COLON thank you .PERIOD for that answer .PERIOD i'm a geologist by training .PERIOD but i love that here .PERIOD we're going to see one backing into a crevice and watch his tentacles -- .PERIOD he just pulls them in makes them look just like algae .PERIOD that's an amazing thing .PERIOD and an octopus ain't that amazing now .PERIOD roger spooked him .PERIOD so he took off in a cloud of ink .PERIOD and when he lands ,COMMA the octopus says ,COMMA oh ,COMMA i've been seen .PERIOD and now he's gone .PERIOD and so am i .PERIOD thank you very much .PERIOD that's the lucy species and was found by my research team in december of 2000 in an area called dikika .PERIOD it's in the northeastern part of ethiopia .PERIOD you don't just jump into an invitation .PERIOD first entertainment comes evidence from flutes that are 35000 years old .PERIOD when you get there ,COMMA this is what you see .PERIOD and it's the vastness of the place ,COMMA which makes you feel helpless and vulnerable .PERIOD you find elephants ,COMMA rhinos ,COMMA monkeys ,COMMA pigs ,COMMA etc .PERIOD again .PERIOD another one ,COMMA that's a monkey that's a pig .PERIOD etc .PERIOD here is a close-up of the fossil after five years of cleaning preparation and description ,COMMA which was very long .PERIOD and i had to expose the bones from the sandstone block .PERIOD i just showed you in the previous slide .PERIOD so then once you've done that ,COMMA the next stage is to know what it is .PERIOD you don't see that in chimpanzees .PERIOD and you don't see this very projecting canine .PERIOD and how old was she when she died ?QUESTIONMARK that's why we need care from our parents .PERIOD so by being at the cusp of our evolutionary history ,COMMA selam unites us all and gives us a unique account on what makes us human up to .PERIOD now the knowledge that we had about our ancestors came essentially from adult individuals ,COMMA because the fossils the baby fossils were missing .PERIOD imagine somebody coming from mars ,COMMA and his job is to report on the type of people occupying our planet earth ,COMMA and you hide all the babies ,COMMA the children ,COMMA and he goes back and reports ,COMMA and they were probably not aware of this future legacy .PERIOD but they did great with an average depth of the oceans of 4000 meters .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA the high seas covers and provides nearly 90 percent of the habitat for life on this earth .PERIOD it is in theory ,COMMA the global commons belonging to us all .PERIOD so here is a picture of the high seas as seen from above -- that area in the darker blue .PERIOD and of course ,COMMA if you want people to play by the rules ,COMMA you still need an effective system of monitoring and enforcement for as we've discovered ,COMMA you can trust ,COMMA but you also need to verify .PERIOD it's also known as the spawning ground for eels from northern european .PERIOD and northern american rivers that are now so dwindling in numbers that they've actually stopped showing up in stockholm and five showed up in the uk .PERIOD just recently ,COMMA it's actually a bay coming closer to here .PERIOD the costa rica dome is a recently ,COMMA discovered area -- ,COMMA potentially year-round habitat for blue whales .PERIOD that is ,COMMA it provides a wonderful example of where you can go with a real regional initiative .PERIOD so what we've been suggesting is that we either need to amend the world heritage convention so that it can adopt and urge universal protection of these world heritage sites ,COMMA or we need to change the name and call it half-the-world heritage convention .PERIOD what i find so exciting is that the census of marine life has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators .PERIOD it's also looked in the really unexplored mid-water column where creatures like this flying sea cucumber have been found .PERIOD and the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information to move ahead to protect some of these significant hope ,COMMA spots hotspots ,COMMA but not all the vessels have those to date .PERIOD we need to get the new paradigm of precaution and respect .PERIOD so here we are seven years 500 interviews later .PERIOD and i'm gonna tell you what really leads to success and makes ted-sters tick .PERIOD and the first thing i say to them is ok ,COMMA well ,COMMA you can't serve yourself .PERIOD you gotta serve others ,COMMA something of value ,COMMA while that might be a somewhat morbid thought .PERIOD i think it has some really profound implications that are worth exploring .PERIOD but today we're all creating this incredibly rich digital archive .PERIOD that's going to live in the cloud indefinitely years after we're gone .PERIOD and what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones ,COMMA complete with photos and videos and stories that they can post after you die .PERIOD but what i think comes next is far more interesting .PERIOD now we're already starting to see some experiments here ,COMMA taking it a step further .PERIOD mit's media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans .PERIOD it's not that it's not possible to feed clothe and house us all and have us live decent lives .PERIOD and that's what will happen to us .PERIOD i accept where we are .PERIOD the future is inherently uncertain .PERIOD imagine our highly-tuned just-in-time food industry ,COMMA and our highly-stressed agricultural system ,COMMA failing and supermarket shelves emptying ,COMMA if we feel it now and think it through ,COMMA we will realize we have nothing to fear but fear itself .PERIOD we can do this .PERIOD i know the free market fundamentalists will tell you that more growth more stuff and nine billion people going shopping is the best we can do .PERIOD we have achieved remarkable things since working out how to grow food .PERIOD some 10000 years ago ,COMMA we've built a powerful foundation of science ,COMMA knowledge and technology ,COMMA -- more than enough to build a society where nine billion people can lead decent meaningful and satisfying lives .PERIOD we can choose this moment of crisis to ask and answer the big questions of society's evolution -- like what do we want to be when we grow up ?QUESTIONMARK when we move past this bumbling adolescence ,COMMA where we think there are no limits and suffer delusions of immortality ,COMMA we can choose life over fear .PERIOD and one more thing archie was suffering from this illness himself .PERIOD so the situation seemed pretty desperate ,COMMA he gives half of them vitamin b12 .PERIOD so cochrane ,COMMA then goes to the germans who are running the prison camp ,COMMA and he can't understand how this barbarism can be tolerated .PERIOD and he vents his frustrations .PERIOD so the symptoms of the complex are no matter how complicated the problem .PERIOD you have an absolutely overwhelming belief that you are infallibly ,COMMA right in your solution .PERIOD you could count them in five minutes .PERIOD what is evolution ?QUESTIONMARK how do you do it ?QUESTIONMARK it falls to the floor .PERIOD you make lots of money .PERIOD ten percent of americans don't disappear every year .PERIOD i sometimes wonder .PERIOD now ,COMMA i've been sort of banging on about this for the last couple of months ,COMMA and people sometimes say to me ,COMMA well ,COMMA tim ,COMMA it's kind of obvious .PERIOD and there's an authority figure in the corner behind the teacher's desk ,COMMA who knows all the answers when schools stop doing that all the time i will admit that .PERIOD yes ,COMMA it's obvious that trial and error is a good thing until then ,COMMA until then i'm going to keep banging on about trial and error and why we should abandon the god complex ,COMMA they had the god complex in spades .PERIOD and after the trial had been running for a little while he gathered together ,COMMA all his colleagues around his table .PERIOD and he said ,COMMA well ,COMMA gentlemen ,COMMA we have some preliminary results .PERIOD shut it down at once tumbleweed rolls through the meeting room .PERIOD it isn't easy .PERIOD so shortly after the war ,COMMA this young man yutaka ,COMMA taniyama developed this amazing conjecture called the taniyama-shimura conjecture .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA it turns out it's equivalent to proving fermat's last theorem .PERIOD you prove one you prove the other .PERIOD and the problem with leverage is it makes the us financial system .PERIOD look like this .PERIOD that means every bad loan goes bad 47 times over .PERIOD and as you think about that ,COMMA you've got to wonder .PERIOD so what do banks have in store for you now ,COMMA except we've been so busy giving away a trillion here ,COMMA a trillion there that we've brought that date of reckoning forward to about 2017 .PERIOD we're going to start to pay them .PERIOD this guy runs the china investment corporation .PERIOD this is an actual bill .PERIOD if you look at the federal budget ,COMMA this is what it looks like .PERIOD everything else is mandated .PERIOD that's the short term .PERIOD that's the flame part among other things ,COMMA because startup companies are 02 percent of us gdp investmentm .PERIOD and they're about 178 percent of output .PERIOD twenty-one countries came together dozens of teams .PERIOD two years ago ,COMMA you saw this creature .PERIOD but then ,COMMA if you lose one of those second set of teeth ,COMMA they don't regrow unless if you're a lawyer .PERIOD so there are now nine women walking around boston with re-grown bladders ,COMMA which is much more pleasant than walking around with a whole bunch of plastic bags for the rest of your life .PERIOD if you don't have a flat world ,COMMA that's not good ,COMMA which is why the robot's we're designing today are a little different .PERIOD and this stuff is moving very quickly .PERIOD and by the way that thing can carry about 350 pounds of weight and about two or three years after they can hear as well as you .PERIOD and i can they'll be able to hear ,COMMA maybe how bats sing or how whales talk or how dogs talk and other types of tonal scales .PERIOD this is a group in germany .PERIOD that's beginning to engineer eyes .PERIOD so that people who are blind can begin to see light and dark very primitive .PERIOD they'll do stuff you and i can't do .PERIOD and it's the 150th anniversary of the publication of the origin of species ,COMMA maybe not once upon a time .PERIOD there was a dread disease that afflicted children .PERIOD and so as a consequence ,COMMA a few years later ,COMMA another scientist -- ,COMMA perhaps ,COMMA maybe this scientist ,COMMA not quite as brilliant as the one who had preceded him ,COMMA but building on the invention of the first one -- came up with a second cure .PERIOD and the beauty of the second cure for this disease was that it could be used on infants and one-year-olds .PERIOD and the government they heard her story and the other people .PERIOD and they said ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA you're right .PERIOD we should make a law .PERIOD we would lose all of our market .PERIOD so many times when you try to do research on data ,COMMA it records complicated stories -- .PERIOD it's hard to find in the data .PERIOD and then finally ,COMMA the last set of bars ,COMMA which are really controlling for everything you could possibly imagine about the crash .PERIOD 50 75 ,COMMA 100 different characteristics of the crash .PERIOD and the other thing you might argue is well car seats have got a lot better over time .PERIOD so they just have these bench seats ,COMMA and they strap the car seat and the seatbelt onto it .PERIOD anyway ,COMMA it turns out that those two crashes that actually the three-year-old did slightly worse .PERIOD so he gets about a 500 out of -- .PERIOD you know ,COMMA on this range -- relative to a 400 and something .PERIOD and this seatbelt would have passed with flying colors into being approved as a car seat .PERIOD it's in 5000 days .PERIOD all this stuff has come .PERIOD there's two million emails per second .PERIOD it's just a huge machine ,COMMA and it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet .PERIOD and in some ways ,COMMA it's sort of back to the kind of old idea of centralized computing .PERIOD and i am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the web .PERIOD they're going to talk to the machine now ,COMMA with rfids and other things ,COMMA -- ,COMMA whatever technology it is ,COMMA it doesn't really matter .PERIOD the point is that everything will have embedded in it ,COMMA some sensor ,COMMA connecting it to the machine .PERIOD and so we have basically an internet of things .PERIOD but in fact ,COMMA what the new economy really is is the marriage of those two ,COMMA where we embed the information and the digital nature of things into the material world attention is the currency .PERIOD and i'm saying humans are now going to be the extended senses of the machine in a certain sense .PERIOD now ,COMMA the second thing that i want to talk about was this idea of restructuring that what the web is doing is restructuring .PERIOD and what you had to do was -- if you wanted to participate in this ,COMMA you had to share packets of information .PERIOD it wasn't like a telephone system where you had control of a line .PERIOD you had to share packets .PERIOD the second stage that we're in now is the idea of linking pages .PERIOD you couldn't deny -- ,COMMA if someone wanted to link to you ,COMMA you couldn't stop them .PERIOD you had to participate in this idea of opening up your pages to be linked by anybody .PERIOD so the last thing i want to talk about is this idea that we're going to be codependent ,COMMA and what is happening with this is some kind of ai ,COMMA but it's not the ai in conscious ai as being an expert .PERIOD larry page told me that that's what they're trying to do .PERIOD and that's what they're trying to do .PERIOD but it'll anticipate what we're doing in a good sense .PERIOD and all these devices will be portals into that .PERIOD it was on jonestown .PERIOD the top picture is a group of moonies that have been blessed by their messiah .PERIOD and so what is this ?QUESTIONMARK how does this work ?QUESTIONMARK these easy ideas to complex questions are very appealing when you are emotionally vulnerable ,COMMA we're beginning to look inside the brain .PERIOD and so if you looked at my brain or any brain ,COMMA that's infected with a viral ,COMMA memetic infection like this ,COMMA and compared it to anyone in this room ,COMMA or anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular basis ,COMMA i am convinced it would look very ,COMMA very different ,COMMA because i have to say for my whole career .PERIOD if there's anything that's been consistent .PERIOD it's been that you can't do it .PERIOD it's calvino's idea of the quickest way between two points is the circuitous line .PERIOD not the straight line .PERIOD we make physical things buildings that become a part in an accretional process .PERIOD they make cities .PERIOD and i've had for 30 years ,COMMA an interest in a series of complexities ,COMMA where a series of forces are brought to bear ,COMMA and to understand the nature of the final result of that representing the building itself .PERIOD this is a project that we just finished in penang for a very ,COMMA very large city project that came directly out of this process ,COMMA which is the result of the multiplicity of forces that produce it and an image ,COMMA which may be closest talks about the use of light as a medium that light becomes literally a building material .PERIOD this will be the first building in the united states that took -- .PERIOD well ,COMMA i can't say it took the air conditioning out .PERIOD it's a hybrid .PERIOD and i understood that building really could be the augmentation of the earth's surface ,COMMA and it completely shifted the notion of building ground in the most basic sense .PERIOD what i'm interested in are how these ideas participate in the educational process of young people ,COMMA one enters the building as it lifts off the ground .PERIOD and it becomes part of the idea .PERIOD and then the skin -- ,COMMA the edges of this -- ,COMMA all promote the dynamic ,COMMA the movement of the building as a series of seismic shifts geologic shifts right ?QUESTIONMARK and finally ,COMMA one of the most interesting projects -- .PERIOD it's a courthouse .PERIOD here's a piano nobile ,COMMA which is a device used in the renaissance .PERIOD it changed the way our history developed .PERIOD it is made for a diet ,COMMA which is soft mushy ,COMMA which is reduced in fibers ,COMMA which is very easily chewable and digestible sounds like fast .PERIOD food doesn't it .PERIOD it's technology .PERIOD so ,COMMA this ingenuity of our ancestors to invent this ,COMMA most marvelous technology ,COMMA we populated all the ecologies .PERIOD it keeps also your brain working .PERIOD okay ,COMMA it's not obvious to be honest now ,COMMA having a large brain ,COMMA as you know ,COMMA is a big advantage ,COMMA because you can actually influence your environment .PERIOD you know ,COMMA we have up to five tastes three of them sustain us .PERIOD so we can make mixtures of all this kind of thing ,COMMA because we know that in cooking ,COMMA we can transform it to the form .PERIOD so satisfaction was a very important part .PERIOD if you get a stomach ache ,COMMA if you get a little bit bloated ,COMMA was not the right food was not the right ,COMMA cooking manipulation ,COMMA or maybe other things went wrong .PERIOD but what it means to have a brain .PERIOD there is that not only the big brain has to talk with the food .PERIOD the food has to talk with the brain ,COMMA because we have to learn actually how to talk to the brains .PERIOD this is the layer ,COMMA which actually touches the food you are swallowing .PERIOD and you digest ,COMMA which is actually the lumen .PERIOD what it means is that we have a layered control system .PERIOD so if you override the hunger signal ,COMMA you can have a disorder ,COMMA which is called anorexia .PERIOD this is fat digestion .PERIOD actually ,COMMA what happens is that a very intricate structure appears .PERIOD you know ,COMMA culture was born of the imagination and the imagination ,COMMA -- ,COMMA the imagination ,COMMA as we know it -- came into being when our species descended from our progenitor ,COMMA homo erectus and infused with consciousness ,COMMA began a journey that would carry it to every corner of the habitable world .PERIOD and the way clayton put it was this way .PERIOD i recently sailed on the hokulea named after the sacred star of hawaii throughout the south pacific ,COMMA to make a film about the navigators .PERIOD i spent 30 years living amongst the people of chinchero .PERIOD and i always heard about an event that i always wanted to participate in .PERIOD and then you do the ritual dances that empower the crosses .PERIOD these of course ,COMMA are the descendants of the ancient tairona civilization .PERIOD there are four societies ,COMMA the kogi ,COMMA the wiwa ,COMMA the kankwano and the arhuacos .PERIOD i traveled with the arhuacos .PERIOD and the wonderful thing about this story was that this man ,COMMA danilo villafane -- ,COMMA if we just jump back here for a second ,COMMA we traveled high into the paramo .PERIOD and as we crested the hills ,COMMA we realized that the men were interpreting every single bump on the landscape ,COMMA in terms of their own intense religiosity .PERIOD and we ran into a farc patrol at dawn .PERIOD so it was quite harrowing .PERIOD they dismiss the rest of us who have ruined the world as the younger brothers .PERIOD they cannot understand why it is that we do what we do to the earth .PERIOD and when asked that question ,COMMA they respond with 6000 different voices .PERIOD they are unique answers to that fundamental question .PERIOD what does it mean to be human and alive ?QUESTIONMARK so you're living through a time when virtually half of humanity's intellectual social and spiritual legacy is being allowed to slip away .PERIOD this does not have to happen .PERIOD so i'd like to spend a few minutes with you folks today ,COMMA imagining what our planet might look like in a thousand years .PERIOD this is crazy .PERIOD if you're in northern europe or north america ,COMMA you can use things like buckwheat husks or oat hulls .PERIOD because the manufacturing process is our organism .PERIOD they're not going to clog up earth's ecosystems .PERIOD they work great .PERIOD my brief ,COMMA as you've just heard is to tell you about statistics -- and to be more precise to tell you some exciting things about statistics .PERIOD don't tell her .PERIOD i said that she paused and said ,COMMA he models things the next time after the 15th toss .PERIOD that's what i want this side to think about either .PERIOD they're the same ,COMMA or this one's bigger than this one ,COMMA or this one's bigger than that .PERIOD one ,COMMA who thinks that c is true -- that on average ,COMMA it'll take less time to see head-tail-head than head-tail-tail .PERIOD the champagne's on ice ,COMMA just next to you ,COMMA you've got the glasses chilled to celebrate .PERIOD and if it comes down a head ,COMMA that's great .PERIOD it's the same for the first two parts of the sequence .PERIOD if it's a head you're disappointed .PERIOD but you're still a third of the way to your pattern again .PERIOD this is my little diversion into my real passion ,COMMA which is genetics when you toss a coin ,COMMA you get a sequence of heads and tails ,COMMA and they're an enormously useful tool in modern molecular biology .PERIOD but it turns out that unlocking the secrets in the information generated by modern experimental technologies ,COMMA a key part of that has to do with fairly sophisticated -- .PERIOD you'll be relieved to know that i do something useful in my day job ,COMMA rather more sophisticated than the head-tail-head story -- ,COMMA but quite sophisticated computer ,COMMA modelings and mathematical modelings and modern statistical techniques .PERIOD it's not the answer ,COMMA and it's not because it's only part of the story .PERIOD here's a little caricature of a million individuals .PERIOD those of you in britain will know about what's become rather a celebrated case of a woman called sally clark who had two babies who died suddenly and to argue ,COMMA then that the chance of a second death is as if you didn't know that information is really silly .PERIOD one of them is that sally clark was innocent -- ,COMMA which is a priori overwhelmingly likely -- most mothers .PERIOD don't kill their children .PERIOD so just to conclude -- ,COMMA what are the take-home messages from this ?QUESTIONMARK we are not good at reasoning with uncertainty ,COMMA all of quality control ,COMMA which has had a major impact on industrial processing is underpinned by statistics .PERIOD this is a world-changing invention .PERIOD well ,COMMA it turns out that the main causes are faulty and misused appliances and electrical wiring hmmm .PERIOD so far ,COMMA we've applied for 414 patent claims .PERIOD so to conclude ,COMMA intelligent power can globally save thousands of lives ,COMMA prevent tens of thousands of injuries and eliminate tens of billions of dollars in property damage .PERIOD every single year ,COMMA while significantly reducing global energy consumption in the spirit of this year's ted conference ,COMMA we think this is a powerful world-changing invention .PERIOD and that's what i'd like to talk to you a little bit about today .PERIOD it's acoustic vibrations in the air ,COMMA little waves of energy in the air that tickle our eardrum .PERIOD and it's at the hair cell level that they do this .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA nothing even actually comes close to our ability to restore hearing .PERIOD and as a physician and a surgeon ,COMMA i can confidently tell my patients that if you had to pick a sense to lose ,COMMA we are the furthest along medically and surgically with hearing .PERIOD okay ,COMMA play that video ,COMMA please .PERIOD i'm saying that they're going to face obstacles that most people who have normal hearing will not have to face now hearing loss ,COMMA and the treatment for hearing loss has really evolved in the past 200 years .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA literally ,COMMA they used to do things like ,COMMA stick ear-shaped objects onto your ears and stick funnels in language is very different .PERIOD language is very precise .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA the whole reason we use it is because it has semantic-specificity .PERIOD but it certainly wasn't the way .PERIOD the music was intended .PERIOD what that suggests is that even in the case of hearing loss ,COMMA the capacity for music remains .PERIOD and here's a video of joseph joseph .PERIOD i was born in 1986 when i was 12 years old .PERIOD i was one of the first few people in singapore ,COMMA who underwent cochlear implantation .PERIOD and this is really unheard of stuff .PERIOD and this is all because of this technology ,COMMA you don't actually have to hear it .PERIOD i know he doesn't hear well ,COMMA because i've heard him do karaoke .PERIOD and so this idea has a lot of traction with us .PERIOD and so i'm here to tell you ,COMMA you don't need a computer to actually have a spell .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA what you can do at the molecular level is that if you encode information -- ,COMMA you encode a spell or program as molecules -- .PERIOD then physics can actually directly interpret that information and run a program .PERIOD that's what happens in proteins when this amino acid sequence gets pronounced as atoms .PERIOD these little letters are sticky for each other .PERIOD so here's a shape .PERIOD i actually spent about a year in my home in my underwear coding ,COMMA like linus [torvalds] in that picture before i mix them together .PERIOD add a little bit of salt water .PERIOD and then add this long strand ,COMMA i was telling you about that i've stolen from a virus .PERIOD and then what happens is you heat this whole thing up to about boiling you cool it down to room temperature ?QUESTIONMARK and as you do ,COMMA what happens is those short strands they do the following thing .PERIOD each one of them ,COMMA binds that long strand in one place ,COMMA and then has a second half that binds that long strand in a distant place ,COMMA and brings those two parts of the long strand close together ,COMMA so that they stick together .PERIOD you can make a molecule that looks like this .PERIOD and you know ,COMMA he likes to hang out with his buddies ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK so that's dna origami .PERIOD that's one way .PERIOD there are many ways of casting molecular spells using dna .PERIOD i did not choose to take up the

gun as an instrument of peace .PERIOD and that is why -- ?QUESTIONMARK and in the netherlands we are very unique in that -- .PERIOD that is why the dutch constitution states that one of the main tasks of the armed forces is to uphold and promote the international rule of law .PERIOD and i hope that one day armies can be disbanded ,COMMA and humans will find a way of living together without violence and oppression .PERIOD i hope you will support our soldiers when they are out there when they come home .PERIOD and when they are injured and need our care ,COMMA you're climbing on little dimples and nubbins in the rock .PERIOD women are much more in balance ,COMMA because they don't have that idea that they're going to be able to do 100 pull-ups .PERIOD they think about how to get the weight over their feet ,COMMA because it's sort of natural -- .PERIOD they carry you all day long .PERIOD it took us 15 years to sequence hiv -- .PERIOD we sequenced sars in 31 days .PERIOD if you put different communication technologies on this logarithmic graph television .PERIOD radio telephone were adopted in decades .PERIOD now ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA if you look at this on a linear graph ,COMMA it looks like everything has just happened .PERIOD but some observer says ,COMMA well ,COMMA kurzweil just put points on this graph that fall on that straight line .PERIOD and again ,COMMA it forms the same straight line .PERIOD you have a little bit of thickening in the line ,COMMA because people do have disagreements what the key points are .PERIOD there's differences of opinion when agriculture started or how long the cambrian explosion took .PERIOD it took us three years to double our price performance of computing in 1900 ,COMMA two years in the middle .PERIOD we're now doubling it every one year supercomputers -- same thing .PERIOD you would think it would be a very erratic process .PERIOD and you have a very smooth outcome of this chaotic process as we make them smaller and less expensive .PERIOD the electrons have less distance to travel .PERIOD and economists have actually started worrying about that .PERIOD this is due to greater productivity .PERIOD but the economist says ,COMMA but there's no way you're going to be able to keep up with that .PERIOD these were evolved in very different times -- .PERIOD we'd like to actually change those programs .PERIOD we'd like to actually turn that program off four or five pharmaceutical companies have noticed .PERIOD this felt that would be interesting drug for the human market .PERIOD and that's just one of the 30000 genes that affect our biochemistry .PERIOD for example ,COMMA we can inhibit genes now with rna interference .PERIOD it's now under a 10th of a cent .PERIOD once we understand its principles of operation and the pace with which we are reverse-engineering biology is accelerating .PERIOD we can actually design these things to be thousands of times more capable ,COMMA where will we get the software wall street noticed that this was a revolutionary technology ,COMMA which it was ?QUESTIONMARK but then six months later ,COMMA when it hadn't revolutionized all business models ,COMMA they figured ,COMMA well that was wrong .PERIOD and then we had this bust .PERIOD images will be written directly to our retina ,COMMA providing full-immersion virtual reality ,COMMA augmented real reality .PERIOD we'll be interacting with virtual personalities .PERIOD you can go there with other people have any kind of experience with anyone involving all of the senses .PERIOD but most importantly ,COMMA it'll be a tremendous expansion of human intelligence through this direct merger with our technology ,COMMA which in some sense we're doing already .PERIOD it's just like this ,COMMA one completely worthless in which it allegedly worked by electrostatic magnetic ion attraction ,COMMA which translates to pseudoscientific baloney .PERIOD -- would be the nice word -- in which you string together a bunch of words that sound good ,COMMA but it does absolutely nothing .PERIOD in this case ,COMMA at trespass points ,COMMA allowing people to go through ,COMMA because your little tracker device said ,COMMA they were .PERIOD okay ,COMMA actually ,COMMA cost lives .PERIOD and in fact ,COMMA i think my thesis here is that belief is the natural state of things ,COMMA and that's called superstition ,COMMA and that i'm afraid we will always have with us .PERIOD you are a hominid three million years ago ,COMMA walking on the plains of africa .PERIOD you've been taken out of the gene pool .PERIOD the fish

somebody looks at you .PERIOD you think people are staring at you because the lights on here .PERIOD so what you see in this particular ambiguous figure is ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the dolphins right .PERIOD that's a dolphin tail there guys .PERIOD so you recognize obama immediately .PERIOD and this is also ,COMMA i think the basis of conspiracy theories explains a lot ,COMMA maybe well ,COMMA that's a whole other lecture .PERIOD we know that if you stimulate the temporal lobe ,COMMA you can produce a feeling of out-of-body experiences ,COMMA near-death experiences ,COMMA which you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe there .PERIOD and you get a sense of out-of-body experience .PERIOD it ties together all this into the power of expectation and the power of belief .PERIOD okay ,COMMA now ,COMMA i'm going to ask you to pucker up pucker up big and lean in just a little bit .PERIOD okay ?QUESTIONMARK jennifer the man came and started undressing me .PERIOD woman

arc of your presentation -- .PERIOD it's got to start like a rocket ,COMMA and everything has got to be reinforcing this .PERIOD okay .PERIOD so how do you do that ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA first of all logical progression ,COMMA you've also got to let me know that there are touchstones .PERIOD you want to tie in to the rest of the world out there .PERIOD so this all feeds in together ,COMMA you want absolute -- .PERIOD this is the zen of presentation right ?QUESTIONMARK so ,COMMA with that said ,COMMA we only have a very ,COMMA very short time .PERIOD you do that .PERIOD you give me your

are most lonely when their kids are zero to five -- ,COMMA probably ,COMMA really zero to two in the process of preparing this .PERIOD we looked at how some other cultures around the world deal with this period of time ,COMMA because here in the western world ,COMMA less than 50 percent of us live near our family members ,COMMA which i think is part of why this is such a tough period .PERIOD the party line is that every single aspect of my life has just gotten dramatically better ever since i participated in the miracle that is childbirth and family .PERIOD as you get older ,COMMA you become more stable .PERIOD you start to realize that ,COMMA hey ,COMMA i could go to this live music event and have an utterly transforming experience that will cover my entire body with goosebumps .PERIOD but it's more likely that i'll feel claustrophobic .PERIOD and i won't be able to get a beer .PERIOD so your average happiness goes up ,COMMA but you lose those transcendent moments ,COMMA but you realize you resubmit yourself to losing control in a really wonderful way ,COMMA which we think provides a lot of meaning to our lives and is quite gratifying .PERIOD we trade the sort of security and

?QUESTIONMARK there's another factor in our case .PERIOD and we had reservations about this on the front end ,COMMA get out of the airplane .PERIOD it turns out you're trekking in nepal .PERIOD rg +

want to hear it in different rooms ,COMMA and whatever we made a new recording of him playing in the shrine auditorium in september .PERIOD and fortunately ,COMMA it's right in here .PERIOD i want to start just by saying a bit about where i'm coming from .PERIOD i trained briefly as a buddhist monk under this guy .PERIOD and although that was great for the music business at the time ,COMMA it wasn't much good for anything else ,COMMA unprecedented ,COMMA wealth and prosperity .PERIOD but that growth hasn't always delivered what we needed rates of depression carried on up right across the

government .PERIOD and i'm here to help .PERIOD and i think more and more people are also asking why boost consumption rather than change what we consume ?QUESTIONMARK it's not that our scientists are necessarily much smarter than they were a hundred years ago ,COMMA maybe they are ,COMMA but they have a hell of a lot more backing than they ever did .PERIOD and he believed we live with others .PERIOD we share the world with others .PERIOD and therefore our innovation must be done with others ,COMMA too ,COMMA not doing things at people for them .PERIOD and so on .PERIOD others are much more pragmatic .PERIOD health coaches learning mentors job clubs .PERIOD now ,COMMA the idea that all of this represents ,COMMA i think ,COMMA is rapidly becoming a common sense ,COMMA and part of how

year in this country as well as a public service innovation lab .PERIOD and if a generation or two ago ,COMMA the big challenges were ones like getting a man on the moon .PERIOD perhaps the challenges we need to set ourselves now are ones like eliminating child ,COMMA malnutrition stopping trafficking ,COMMA or one ,COMMA i think closer to home for america or europe .PERIOD why don't we set ourselves the goal of achieving a billion extra years of life for today's citizens ?QUESTIONMARK now those are all goals ,COMMA which could be achieved within a decade ,COMMA but only with radical and systematic experiment ,COMMA not just with technologies ,COMMA but also with lifestyles and culture and policies and institutions too history was over and society would inevitably have to take second place to economy .PERIOD just as today ,COMMA the enthusiasts of unrestrained capitalism say it's rooted in human nature ,COMMA only now it's individualism inquisitiveness .PERIOD and so on .PERIOD you think i've lost my way .PERIOD and somebody's going to come on the stage in a minute and guide me gently back to my seat .PERIOD i want to tell you about my friend who was teaching english to adults in abu dhabi ,COMMA and one fine day .PERIOD she decided to take them into the garden to teach them .PERIOD some nature vocabulary ,COMMA a language dies .PERIOD every 14 days that is a little bit too early .PERIOD we were brought to teach english ,COMMA because the government wanted to modernize the country and to empower the citizens through education .PERIOD but if you're not a native speaker ,COMMA you have to pass a test .PERIOD do we really want to end up with 600 languages ,COMMA and the main one being english or chinese ?QUESTIONMARK and i want to remind you that the giants upon whose shoulders today's intelligentsia stand did not have to have english .PERIOD they didn't have to pass an english test .PERIOD let me tell you a story about two scientists ,COMMA two english scientists .PERIOD so he invented a cost-free solar lamp when he received his award .PERIOD he said ,COMMA these lovely words .PERIOD the children can lead africa from what it is today ,COMMA a dark continent to a light continent .PERIOD i am known best for human-powered flight .PERIOD but that was just one thing that got me going in the sort of things that i'm working in now .PERIOD and we thought a solar-powered plane wouldn't really make sense ,COMMA but you could do it .PERIOD and it would get a lot of publicity for solar power and maybe help that field .PERIOD you don't need to dig down for these chemicals .PERIOD and we can do things much more efficiently .PERIOD so this just summarizes it .PERIOD over billions of years on a unique sphere ,COMMA chance has painted a thin covering of life ,COMMA -- complex and probable ,COMMA wonderful and fragile .PERIOD suddenly we humans .PERIOD a recently arrived species no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature ,COMMA have grown in population ,COMMA technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power .PERIOD we now wield the paintbrush .PERIOD okay .PERIOD and let's have the next .PERIOD and then also ,COMMA like it said ,COMMA in the video ,COMMA you can turn it left or right ,COMMA just by putting the lift under one wing or another .PERIOD and that's it .PERIOD yeah ,COMMA just a few inventions ,COMMA most of the talks that you've heard in the last several fabulous days have been from people who have the characteristic that they have thought about something .PERIOD they are experts .PERIOD they know what's going on .PERIOD all of ,COMMA you know ,COMMA about the topic that i'm supposed to talk about .PERIOD well ,COMMA it enables you to drink coffee .PERIOD and the other ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is a birth control pill ,COMMA which in a very simple way ,COMMA fundamentally changed the structure of society by changing the role of women in it ,COMMA by providing to them the opportunity to make reproductive choices .PERIOD it's like what is simplicity ?QUESTIONMARK what is the state of science ?QUESTIONMARK and interestingly ,COMMA complexity is very highly evolved .PERIOD one of the things i want to do is to help you with a very important task -- ,COMMA which you may not know that you have very often -- ,COMMA which is to understand how to sit next to a physicist at a dinner party and have a conversation .PERIOD and the words that i would like you to focus on are complexity and emergence ,COMMA because these will enable you to start the conversation and then daydream about other things .PERIOD and that's complexity all right .PERIOD so let me give you an example of simplicity of a particular kind .PERIOD the question is ,COMMA why is binary simpler than arabic ?QUESTIONMARK and this is a map of bitflows across the continent that is ,COMMA you can stack them .PERIOD and you put a drop in this case of urine at the bottom .PERIOD it turns colors ,COMMA in this particular case ,COMMA you're reading kidney function .PERIOD if you take too much out of something that's simple ,COMMA you lose function .PERIOD so you can't make it too simple .PERIOD and the second is a design issue ,COMMA and it's not directly relevant ,COMMA but it's a nice statement .PERIOD so what i think one can begin to do with this kind of cut at the word simplicity ,COMMA which doesn't cover brancusi .PERIOD it doesn't answer the question of why mondrian is better or worse ,COMMA or simpler ,COMMA or less simpler than van gogh ,COMMA and certainly doesn't address the question of whether mozart is simpler than bach .PERIOD you've got a company set up to i want to open by quoting einstein's wonderful statement ,COMMA just so people will feel at ease that the great scientist of the 20th century also agrees with us ,COMMA and also calls us to this action .PERIOD i know the next buddha will come a few thousand years from now ,COMMA but exists currently in a certain heaven -- .PERIOD that's maitreya -- .PERIOD so i'm going to go on a retreat ,COMMA and i'm going to meditate and pray until the buddha .PERIOD maitreya reveals himself to me and gives me a teaching or something to revive the practice of compassion in the world today .PERIOD and the man said ,COMMA really ,COMMA and he showed him a dish full of needles .PERIOD so he said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA i get the point .PERIOD he went back to his cave .PERIOD he meditated again .PERIOD another three years ,COMMA no vision .PERIOD he leaves again .PERIOD so he thought i will take the maggots and put them on this piece of flesh ,COMMA then clean the dog's wounds .PERIOD and then i'll figure out what to do with the maggots .PERIOD so he starts to do that .PERIOD he can't grab the maggots .PERIOD he jumps back .PERIOD and there ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is the future buddha maitreya in a beautiful vision ,COMMA -- rainbow lights .PERIOD golden jeweled ,COMMA a plasma body ,COMMA an exquisite mystic vision ,COMMA -- that he sees .PERIOD so as he comes up from his first bow ,COMMA he says ,COMMA my lord ,COMMA i'm so happy to see you .PERIOD but where have you been for 12 years ?QUESTIONMARK and maitreya says ,COMMA i was with you who do you think was making needles and making nests and dripping on rocks for you ,COMMA mister dense looking for the buddha in person .PERIOD he said ,COMMA so ,COMMA naturally ,COMMA they chased him out of town .PERIOD you gave me that expression the eternal ,COMMA mama ,COMMA you said ,COMMA that's wonderful .PERIOD so they first create this foundation of equality ,COMMA and we don't hate anyone .PERIOD therefore .PERIOD so we equalize that's very important .PERIOD and this is the way you do it .PERIOD you take any being who looks weird to you .PERIOD and you see how they could be familiar to you .PERIOD you reduce the feeling of otherness about beings .PERIOD and then you connect that with your feeling that everyone has that motherly possibility ,COMMA and they then never get any positive feedback .PERIOD compassion makes you happy .PERIOD the first person who is happy when you get great .PERIOD compassion is yourself ,COMMA even if you haven't done anything yet for anybody else ,COMMA because traditional economic theory would say ,COMMA well ,COMMA the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation that had a big r&ampd lab where they were thinking up new projects .PERIOD and it came out of there .PERIOD it didn't come from there .PERIOD the ideas are coming back from the consumers ,COMMA and they're often ahead of the producers ,COMMA the very first landline telephones ,COMMA the inventors thought that they would be used for people to listen in to live performances from west end ,COMMA theaters more and more .PERIOD the inventors of things will not be able to say that in advance ,COMMA the second reason why users are more and more important is that they are the source of big ,COMMA disruptive innovations ,COMMA take astronomy as an example ,COMMA which yochai has already mentioned .PERIOD what does this mean then for our organizational landscape ?QUESTIONMARK let me just give you two examples ,COMMA which venture capitalist in their right .PERIOD mind is going to give you any money to set up a venture competing with microsoft with microsoft outlook ,COMMA no one ,COMMA because the professionals over here ,COMMA in these closed organizations -- ,COMMA they might be academics ,COMMA they might be programmers .PERIOD they might be doctors .PERIOD they might be journalists -- ,COMMA my former profession -- say ,COMMA no ,COMMA no -- .PERIOD you can't trust these people over here .PERIOD they want to as jimmy said ,COMMA they want to have a dialogue a conversation .PERIOD what should be the role of public policy ?QUESTIONMARK and i was having dinner with this guy called timothy chan didn't go into the internet ,COMMA kept his money decided to go into computer games at any one time .PERIOD there are four million people playing one of his games .PERIOD how many people does he employ to service that population ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA how can he service ?QUESTIONMARK 250 million people from 500 employees ?QUESTIONMARK imagine you could take all the children in education in britain ,COMMA and one percent of them were co-developers of education .PERIOD or if you got one percent of the patients in the nhs to in some sense ,COMMA be co-producers of health .PERIOD for example ,COMMA i get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners .PERIOD and i figured i'd put it on the internet for all employees under stress to help you better deal with what you're going through on your job .PERIOD and so i said ,COMMA let's put this together in an album .PERIOD we can build all sorts of environments to make it a little bit easier .PERIOD but ultimately ,COMMA what we're trying to do is really connect with one other person ,COMMA recording .PERIOD okay ,COMMA here's something .PERIOD but sometimes i feel really lonely like even people in convenience stores saying have a nice day when they're accidentally looking me in the eye .PERIOD and i got a lot like 30 in a half an hour .PERIOD i was like ,COMMA i don't know .PERIOD but anyway ,COMMA this same person laura ended up emailing me a little bit after that project .PERIOD so i asked her ,COMMA what does it feel like when you feel this way ?QUESTIONMARK i said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA i'll think about it .PERIOD and when you put them together ,COMMA something magical happens ,COMMA something absolutely incredible happens .PERIOD and all of a sudden i get a chorus from around the world .PERIOD and over the past 35 years ,COMMA i've studied behavior on the basis of everything from genes through neurotransmitters dopamine things like that ,COMMA all the way through circuit analysis .PERIOD it's really a very precisely timed thing .PERIOD so there is the pattern that every one of them had ,COMMA but they all were a little different too .PERIOD a key thing is that the major violence genes ,COMMA it's called the mao-a gene .PERIOD it's on the x chromosome .PERIOD and so in this way ,COMMA you can only get it from your mother .PERIOD and what i think might happen in these areas of the world where we have constant violence ,COMMA you end up having generations of kids that are seeing all this violence .PERIOD now ,COMMA i said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA so what we have lizzie ,COMMA but it doesn't stop there ,COMMA but there's gonna be bad news somewhere .PERIOD it's the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted .PERIOD so you might be asking why absolutely everything ?QUESTIONMARK actually ,COMMA if you just look at your thumbnail -- about a square centimeter -- ,COMMA there are something like 60 billion neutrinos per second from the sun passing through every square centimeter of your body .PERIOD and these particles have been discovered over the last century ,COMMA pretty much one of the wonderful things .PERIOD actually ,COMMA i find is that we've discovered any of them when you realize how tiny they are .PERIOD so one of my most illustrious forebears at manchester university ,COMMA ernest ,COMMA rutherford ,COMMA discoverer of the atomic nucleus ,COMMA once said ,COMMA all science is either physics or stamp collecting .PERIOD now .PERIOD i don't think he meant to insult the rest of science ,COMMA although he was from new zealand .PERIOD so it's possible .PERIOD but imagine someone who's not very popular moves through the room .PERIOD the picture is that the electrons and the quarks in your body ,COMMA and in the universe that we see around us are heavy in a sense and massive ,COMMA because they're surrounded by higgs particles .PERIOD this is a creation story .PERIOD i think equally as wonderful .PERIOD so that's the lhc .PERIOD when i grew up and realized that science fiction was not a good source for superpowers .PERIOD i decided instead to embark on a journey of real science to find a more useful truth by measuring their student smiles ,COMMA researchers were able to predict how fulfilling and long-lasting a subject's marriage will be how well she would score on standardized tests of well-being and how inspiring she would be to others outside of this room ,COMMA more than a third of us smile more than 20 times per day ,COMMA whereas less than 14 percent of us smile ,COMMA less than five ,COMMA the finding supported darwin's theory by showing that facial feedback modifies the neural processing of emotional content in the brain in a way that helps us feel better .PERIOD when we smile ,COMMA it is a user-appropriate technology that has been used for humanitarian good to great effect .PERIOD the grassroots has been strengthened through the social power of sharing ,COMMA and they are challenging the old models ,COMMA the old analog models of control and command .PERIOD if you were to arrive in nairobi today and pick up a tourist map ,COMMA kibera is represented as a lush green national park ,COMMA devoid of human settlement .PERIOD they're normally backroom or basement hardware service providers ,COMMA but they need to be elevated to software strategists .PERIOD but if you're like me ,COMMA my humanity is more like a window .PERIOD then suddenly i see it and usually it's never good .PERIOD my mother was english .PERIOD she was five foot two ,COMMA very feisty and very english .PERIOD this is how english my mother is -- ,COMMA or was she just passed .PERIOD and then we went to a fish restaurant ,COMMA and we had chad ,COMMA the surfer ,COMMA dude ,COMMA serving us .PERIOD and he came up ,COMMA and my mother said ,COMMA do you have any specials young man ?QUESTIONMARK and my mother turned to me and said ,COMMA what language is he speaking ,COMMA but her igbo wasn't too good .PERIOD so here are these women who never discuss their period with their husbands .PERIOD and here i am telling them .PERIOD well ,COMMA how often do you get your period ?QUESTIONMARK it was my mother with five little children .PERIOD can you imagine this five-foot-two woman standing up to men with guns ,COMMA who want to kill us ?QUESTIONMARK and she said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you can steel your heart against any kind of trouble ,COMMA any kind of horror .PERIOD and then the next planting season ,COMMA when they sang the dirge ,COMMA they would remove as many names of the dead that equaled as many people that were born ,COMMA which would seem to suggest that apartheid was entirely .PERIOD the business of men .PERIOD their humanity never seems to matter very much to us ,COMMA and a lot of rituals involved killing killing little animals progressing along .PERIOD so when i turned 13 -- ,COMMA and i mean it made sense .PERIOD it was an agrarian community .PERIOD somebody had to kill the animals .PERIOD there was no whole foods .PERIOD you could go and get kangaroo steak at -- .PERIOD so when i turned 13 ,COMMA it was my turn now to kill a goat .PERIOD now ,COMMA when i was growing up ,COMMA he used to tell me stories about how he used to bayonet people ,COMMA and their intestines would fall out ,COMMA but they would keep running .PERIOD but he was desperate to show that he'd just come back .PERIOD so he summoned me up ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA go into the bedroom ,COMMA my bedroom .PERIOD that's basically how this thing operates .PERIOD so one of the advantages of this design is ,COMMA when you scale things down ,COMMA the robot naturally becomes agile .PERIOD it's inversely proportional to r .PERIOD no matter how you throw it ,COMMA the robot recovers and comes back to him .PERIOD so here are robots carrying beams columns and assembling cube-like structures .PERIOD so you might want to have multiple robots carry payloads .PERIOD so we use a little trick ,COMMA they sense their neighbors .PERIOD so again ,COMMA the robots monitor this error and calculate the control commands ,COMMA 100 times a second ,COMMA which then translates to the motor commands 600 times a second ,COMMA as you can see here ,COMMA they collapse from a three-dimensional formation into planar formation .PERIOD another application .PERIOD i want to show you -- again .PERIOD this is in our lab .PERIOD so his algorithm essentially tells these robots how to autonomously build cubic structures from truss-like elements .PERIOD so all these experiments you've seen thus far all these demonstrations have been done with the help of motion capture systems .PERIOD it figures out where it is with respect to the features ,COMMA and then estimates its position 100 times a second ,COMMA allowing us to use the control algorithms that i described to you earlier .PERIOD you will see nine robots play six different instruments .PERIOD let's watch unless you're on .PERIOD one of these californian low-carb diets .PERIOD bread is standard .PERIOD and i think it is because we feel that this kind of bread really is about authenticity .PERIOD and this is about good taste ,COMMA good traditions .PERIOD but we have somehow in the course of the last few centuries ,COMMA or even decades ,COMMA started to cultivate an image of a mythical rural agricultural past .PERIOD so what is happening ?QUESTIONMARK bread has migrated to tropical countries where the middle classes now eat french rolls and hamburgers ,COMMA and where the commuters find bread ,COMMA much more handy to use than rice or cassava .PERIOD this is where it all comes from .PERIOD and where these farmers who actually ten thousand years ago ,COMMA put us on the road of bread .PERIOD let's go back to traditional farming ,COMMA and i'm making a real plea here .PERIOD we've moved towards large-scale and very high control .PERIOD what i want us to do is to keep up the science ,COMMA and even get more science in there ,COMMA but go to a kind of regional scale ,COMMA -- ,COMMA not just in terms of the scale of the fields ,COMMA but in terms of the entire food network .PERIOD so what kind of science can we have ?QUESTIONMARK we cannot solve the world food problem by using biological agriculture .PERIOD everything is linked together understand that you are part of this enormous chain of events ,COMMA and as you eat it .PERIOD and as you try it -- ,COMMA please come and stand up every meal .PERIOD you eat contains ingredients from all across the world ,COMMA and that i think evolutionarily-speaking is unique .PERIOD and today is a time for me to talk to you about water ,COMMA this crocodile ,COMMA which grows to almost 20 feet long in the northern rivers .PERIOD and this charismatic snake the king cobra .PERIOD and it really works to start with them .PERIOD the people of this part of india ,COMMA worship the king cobra .PERIOD it's just a wresting match ,COMMA but a remarkable activity .PERIOD and now the king cobra is a new one .PERIOD it survived ,COMMA even during the time that the dinosaurs died off .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA if you see the map ,COMMA the range of their original habitat was all the way from the indus in pakistan to the irrawaddy in burma .PERIOD and pretty soon we were seeing sights like this .PERIOD this was actually just taken last year .PERIOD my pals in the crocodile specialist group of the iucn ,COMMA the [madras crocodile bank] ,COMMA an ngo ,COMMA the world wildlife fund the wildlife institute of india state forest departments and the ministry of environment .PERIOD we all work together on stuff .PERIOD so it seemed that the toxin that was killing .PERIOD the gharial was something in the food chain ,COMMA something in the fish they were eating .PERIOD but poolan devi was one [of them] ,COMMA which actually shekhar kapur made an incredible movie ,COMMA the bandit ,COMMA queen ,COMMA which i urge you to see .PERIOD so ,COMMA who is next us ?QUESTIONMARK we've got a lot of a good team of people working up there ,COMMA so we can do it .PERIOD and there is a gharial looking at us from the river .PERIOD namaste .PERIOD i look at it as a creature who is totally frightened of something so dangerous as a human being .PERIOD you were saying that that hasn't been filmed before .PERIOD and the guy who is working there with them ,COMMA he's from maharashtra .PERIOD he said ,COMMA i think he's after the nusha whenever he eats the pit viper .PERIOD he gets this little venom rush to me that’s the real natural wonder .PERIOD and the insurance companies found that they began to save almost 30000 dollars per patient .PERIOD and medicare is now in the middle of doing a demonstration project where they’re paying for 1800 people to go through the program on the sites that we train and i’ll talk more about this .PERIOD but the real epidemic isn’t ,COMMA just heart disease or obesity ,COMMA or smoking ,COMMA -- it’s ,COMMA loneliness and depression .PERIOD and the pain is not the problem ,COMMA it’s ,COMMA the symptom .PERIOD what was the biggest selling drug of all time when it was introduced a few years ago .PERIOD so the very behaviors that we think of as being so sexy in our culture are the very ones that leave .PERIOD so many people feeling tired ,COMMA lethargic ,COMMA depressed and impotent and that’s ,COMMA not much fun .PERIOD your sexual function improves when you eat a big fatty meal ,COMMA how do you feel you feel kind of sleepy afterwards ?QUESTIONMARK these are not election returns .PERIOD these are the percentage of people who are overweight .PERIOD he says ,COMMA i’ve got some good news .PERIOD what we found was that after a year ,COMMA none of the experimental group patients who made these lifestyle changes needed treatment .PERIOD whereas six of

the korean war .PERIOD i think ,COMMA and from this experiment ,COMMA they moved on to chairs .PERIOD when play is about building a tower out of blocks .PERIOD the kid begins to learn a lot about towers .PERIOD and as they repeatedly knock it down and start again ,COMMA learning is happening as a sort of by-product of play .PERIOD so they learned their way to that by building prototypes .PERIOD and all of a sudden a productive conversation was happening about design around a tangible object ,COMMA the prototyping carts filled with colored paper and play-doh and glue sticks and stuff -- .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them ,COMMA but by giving project teams and the clients who they’re working with permission to think with their hands ,COMMA quite complex ideas can spring into life and go right through to execution ,COMMA much more easily we’re doing the same thing as designers .PERIOD so remember ,COMMA the sketching task .PERIOD we did at the beginning as designers .PERIOD we need to be able to transition in and out of play also .PERIOD and it doesn't take long to go downhill ,COMMA and i got distracted by it .PERIOD and suddenly i was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent .PERIOD when i should have been talking to my clients ,COMMA my partner and i thom ,COMMA we had to let all our employees go because with no employees ,COMMA there was nobody for me to manage .PERIOD and i grew up in this little farming town in northern nevada .PERIOD britlin was so innocent and so sweet .PERIOD and her voice was so pure .PERIOD and i had this idea if i could get 50 people to all do this same thing :COLON sing their parts ,COMMA -- ,COMMA soprano ,COMMA alto tenor and bass -- wherever they were in the world post their videos to youtube .PERIOD we could cut it all together and create a virtual choir .PERIOD and i sent out this call to singers ,COMMA and i made free the download of the music to a piece that i had written in the year 2000 called lux aurumque ,COMMA which means light and gold .PERIOD this is evangelina etienne from massachusetts .PERIOD i was told later ,COMMA and also by lots of singers who were involved in this that they sometimes recorded 50 or 60 different takes until they got just the right ,COMMA take -- .PERIOD they uploaded it .PERIOD he scrubbed the audio .PERIOD and then we posted this video to youtube about a year and a half ago ,COMMA we had a million hits in the first month and got a lot of attention for it .PERIOD and there were 900 people involved in that .PERIOD and we also put a page on facebook for the singers to upload their testimonials ,COMMA what it was like for them their experience singing it ,COMMA my sister and i used to sing in choirs together constantly me too .PERIOD it is a dream come true to be part of this choir ,COMMA as i've never been part of one .PERIOD and the second is that people seem to be experiencing an actual connection .PERIOD it wasn't a virtual choir .PERIOD but i know myself too .PERIOD i feel this virtual esprit de corps if you will with all of them .PERIOD this is a recording i made of a mantis shrimp .PERIOD that's found off the coast of california and mantis shrimp are called mantis shrimp after the praying mantises ,COMMA which also have a fast feeding appendage .PERIOD and i started to think ,COMMA well ,COMMA maybe it will be interesting while listening to their sounds to figure out how these animals generate very fast feeding strikes .PERIOD so we got this incredible video system .PERIOD it's very new technology -- .PERIOD it just came out about a year ago -- that allows you to film at extremely high speeds in low light .PERIOD and as you'll notice ,COMMA it's still pretty gosh darn fast .PERIOD slowed down 333 times .PERIOD it's an incredibly powerful movement .PERIOD so what we calculated was that the limbs were moving at the peak speed ,COMMA ranging from 10 meters per second ,COMMA all the way up to 23 meters per second .PERIOD it takes a long time for the muscle to contract ,COMMA and a very short time for the limb to fly out .PERIOD there needs to be some kind of spring-loaded mechanism in order to generate the amount of force that we observe and the speed that we observe and the output of the system .PERIOD the saddle-shaped structure is also known as a hyperbolic paraboloid surface ,COMMA or an anticlastic surface in biological systems .PERIOD it's important ,COMMA not to have a whole lot of extra material requirements for building it .PERIOD and so this is just a regular video of the animal just smashing the heck out of this load cell .PERIOD and again ,COMMA i think this will be a world record .PERIOD and what i'd like you to do in this shot is keep your eye on this on the surface of the load cell .PERIOD as the limb comes flying through people have been struggling for years to try and design a very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn't cavitate and literally wear away the metal and put holes in it .PERIOD just like these pictures show .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA you might have even seen some cavitation going up the edge of the limb very ,COMMA very convenient solution to that particular problem .PERIOD and there's actually a spectacular colored dot in the center of the saddles of many species of stomatopods .PERIOD and this is quite interesting to find evolutionary origins of visual signals on .PERIOD what's really in all species their spring .PERIOD and so i'm very curious about whether those colored dots in the center of the saddles are conveying some kind of information about their ability to strike or their strike force .PERIOD and something about the time period in the molting cycle .PERIOD we still have one foot in the dark ages ts .PERIOD eliot really said it for me -- .PERIOD and this should give you goose bumps .PERIOD we shall not cease from exploration .PERIOD and the end of our exploring shall be to return where we started and know the place for the first time ,COMMA it’s ,COMMA a thin film ,COMMA two-dimensional existence .PERIOD and if you hefted those two things ,COMMA you might find that the relative scale of those is 20 to 1 .PERIOD it actually is a very good working sub ,COMMA -- that’s .PERIOD what it was designed for a seat works in a two-dimensional world ,COMMA where gravity blasts down on that seat .PERIOD ok ,COMMA most of life on earth is in that inner atmosphere .PERIOD this is a three-dimensional machine .PERIOD this is man’s first attempt at flying underwater .PERIOD chris asked us to show stuff that hasn’t been shown before i’m trying to do everything very gently .PERIOD this is the first flying machine .PERIOD this was the first prototype there’re ,COMMA no silly buoyancy ,COMMA tanks -- it’s ,COMMA permanently positively buoyant she’s ,COMMA just a few inches off the top of my head .PERIOD and so how i see my work contributing is sort of trying to literally re-imagine these connections and physically rebuild them .PERIOD so the era of big infrastructure is over .PERIOD so albeit a very small creature ,COMMA and very modest .PERIOD this creature is incredible because it can agglomerate into these mega-reef structures ,COMMA but you can see ,COMMA even just intuit from this map that the harbor has dredged and flattened and went from a rich three-dimensional mosaic to flat muck in really a matter of years .PERIOD now ,COMMA the gowanus is particularly smelly -- .PERIOD i will admit it when we started this project .PERIOD one of the core ideas was to look back in history and try to understand what was there ?QUESTIONMARK we also learned at this time that you could eat an oyster about the size of a dinner plate in the gowanus canal itself .PERIOD it ,COMMA accepts algae and detritus in one end .PERIOD and through this beautiful glamorous set of stomach organs out .PERIOD the other end comes cleaner .PERIOD water .PERIOD basically ,COMMA new york was built on the backs of oystermen ,COMMA and our streets were literally built over oyster shells .PERIOD what is fuzzy rope ?QUESTIONMARK you ask ?QUESTIONMARK so we imagine that we would actually potentially even host a bake sale to start our new project .PERIOD so get your tevas on .PERIOD and then those spat are then seeded and also showing oyster gardening for the community along its edges .PERIOD and finally ,COMMA how much fun it would be to watch the flupsy parade and cheer on the oyster spats ,COMMA as they go down to the reef .PERIOD so sorry ,COMMA -- ,COMMA it just feels like i should be doing stand-up up here because of the setting ,COMMA because if we get it out of the streets ,COMMA it'll smell much better and -- .PERIOD oh right ,COMMA we drink from the river .PERIOD and he'd made the case in a number of papers and done a number of studies .PERIOD but nothing had really stuck .PERIOD you can't really see it in this map .PERIOD but this is the map that becomes the central focus in the second half of my book .PERIOD so it was this incredibly terrifying event ,COMMA just an extraordinary terrifying scene .PERIOD and eventually snow made a map of the outbreak .PERIOD and he thought about representing that as a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods .PERIOD people who hadn't ,COMMA you know ,COMMA percentages of people who hadn't .PERIOD but eventually ,COMMA he hit upon the idea that what he needed was something that you could see .PERIOD and so with the help of this map ,COMMA and with the help of more evangelizing that he did over the next few years ,COMMA and that whitehead did eventually ,COMMA actually ,COMMA the authorities slowly started to come around .PERIOD we don't worry that new york city is going to collapse in on itself .PERIOD quite the way that you know ,COMMA rome did and be 10 percent of its size in 100 years ,COMMA or 200 years .PERIOD his whole monastery was thrown into prison .PERIOD at the time of the uprising ,COMMA when the dalai lama had to leave tibet .PERIOD and it just so happened on the fifth week .PERIOD there was a public teaching by the dalai lama .PERIOD i interview and do portraits .PERIOD so this is our icon to non-violence in our world -- one of our living icons .PERIOD this is mengatoue .PERIOD he's the shaman of the huaorani .PERIOD and he said to us ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i'm an older man .PERIOD now ,COMMA i'm getting tired .PERIOD you know ,COMMA i'm tired of spearing ,COMMA these oil workers .PERIOD and this kid lived in the village -- .PERIOD he wasn't there at the time -- .PERIOD and this is the little movie .PERIOD he put together about that .PERIOD it's a question of what's the continuity ?QUESTIONMARK we draw this set of nested spheres ,COMMA cut away ,COMMA so you see it .PERIOD so if you take a picture of what's going on ,COMMA it's 10 years ago ,COMMA and we go through a period of accelerating expansion ,COMMA and the universe expands and cools until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent ,COMMA then to the dark ages .PERIOD and then the first stars turn on ,COMMA and they evolve into galaxies .PERIOD and then later they get to the more expansive galaxies .PERIOD i always think of space-time as being the real substance of space and the galaxies ,COMMA and the stars ,COMMA just like the foam on the ocean and just put radially .PERIOD they're going out that way .PERIOD what happens is you take pictures as the earth rotates .PERIOD you get a fan across the sky .PERIOD do you see the fan-like scans made across the sky ?QUESTIONMARK so again ,COMMA you can see the extension of this great wall of galaxies showing up here .PERIOD and we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK so ,COMMA i'll show you the next movie .PERIOD we're going to keep zooming in .PERIOD ok .PERIOD and so i forgot to tell you the scale .PERIOD so it takes light .PERIOD three billion years to travel over that distance .PERIOD there's a very simple fluid to begin with .PERIOD and so ,COMMA you know ,COMMA when you first saw this picture ,COMMA it didn't mean quite so much to you here .PERIOD you're looking across one percent of the volume of the visible universe ,COMMA and you're seeing billions of galaxies ,COMMA right and nodes .PERIOD but you realize they're not even the main structure ,COMMA and we're going to fly around ,COMMA and we'll fly around .PERIOD and you'll see occasionally a couple of filaments intersect ,COMMA and you get a large cluster of galaxies .PERIOD so the question is ,COMMA how hard would it be to assemble this right ?QUESTIONMARK and so here we are .PERIOD this is how if you took billions of years to go around ,COMMA it might look to you right ?QUESTIONMARK and if you could see invisible matter too ,COMMA we're going to start and realize that the entire visible universe ,COMMA everything we can see in every direction with the hubble space telescope ,COMMA plus our other instruments was once in a region that was smaller than an atom .PERIOD so i'm going to show you one that can be run on a desktop in two days in the next picture .PERIOD and at that point ,COMMA the universe mysteriously starts accelerating ,COMMA its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger-scale structure .PERIOD the fact is that we're living longer .PERIOD it really involves many different areas .PERIOD and that's where the field is today .PERIOD we then grow the cells outside the body .PERIOD take the scaffold coat ,COMMA the scaffold with the cells ,COMMA -- ,COMMA the patient's own cells ,COMMA two different cell types .PERIOD so the strategy here is -- .PERIOD this is actually a ct scan ,COMMA an x-ray -- .PERIOD and we go layer by layer using computerized morphometric imaging analysis and 3d reconstruction to get right down to those patient's own kidneys .PERIOD and this is actually a new technology we're working on .PERIOD now ,COMMA i was able to do more things ,COMMA most of my professors were all for it .PERIOD and they said ,COMMA bring pictures and show me the clips online .PERIOD and i'm happy for you 'i failed' .PERIOD he cried one was -- .PERIOD never be late .PERIOD never be late .PERIOD that's what he tried to teach me and my brothers at one time ,COMMA he spelled moriarty with only one 'i' you .PERIOD and i know deeper down .PERIOD there's always a chance to win the crown ,COMMA giving all it seems to me is not so far from victory .PERIOD don't whine .PERIOD don't complain .PERIOD don't make excuses not necessary to what you would want them to be ,COMMA but they will be about what they should .PERIOD and only you will know whether you can do that .PERIOD i mention in my book they call me coach .PERIOD so they had qualities that -- .PERIOD they came close to -- as close to reaching possibly their full potential as any players i ever had .PERIOD so in other words ,COMMA what's happening here is that swaptree solves my carrying company's sugar rush problem .PERIOD a problem ,COMMA the economists call the coincidence of wants in approximately 60 seconds .PERIOD so ,COMMA what's happening here ?QUESTIONMARK we're bartering trading ,COMMA swapping sharing ,COMMA but they're being reinvented into dynamic and appealing forms over the next minute .PERIOD you're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display of all the dots that went on in my head .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA we're monkeys ,COMMA and we're born and bred to share and cooperate .PERIOD and we were doing so for thousands of years ,COMMA whether it's when we hunted in packs or farmed in cooperatives before this big system called hyper-consumption came along .PERIOD and we built these fences and created out own little fiefdoms .PERIOD they're growing up sharing -- files .PERIOD video games ,COMMA knowledge .PERIOD thomas friedman is one of my favorite new york times columnists .PERIOD and he poignantly commented that 2008 is when we hit a wall when mother nature and the market ,COMMA both said ,COMMA no more .PERIOD the second is collaborative lifestyles ,COMMA just think of libraries and laundrettes .PERIOD they are what i consider to be the cities of tomorrow ,COMMA the new urban world .PERIOD now ,COMMA why do i say that after we finished armstrong straightened his tie ,COMMA put on a wool ,COMMA sports jacket .PERIOD and we headed out into the glare .PERIOD i thought they might be playing king of the hill .PERIOD but i was wrong 'it's ,COMMA a simple life ,COMMA but nobody is restricting you .PERIOD beer is a very important thing in brazil .PERIOD this here ,COMMA on the right-hand side is what's called a -- .PERIOD if you look at the fine print under the awning -- ,COMMA it's a hotel .PERIOD and the second aspect is that once you have 2000 people in the community ,COMMA you can petition the government to be recognized as a legal sub-municipality .PERIOD my family moved ,COMMA we're nomads .PERIOD but these two people worked something out right now ,COMMA those and other neurologic diseases -- for which we have no cure or prevention -- cost about a third of a trillion dollars a year .PERIOD it will be well over a trillion dollars by 2050 .PERIOD and the avian flu is also not a good idea .PERIOD you should also keep your blood pressure down because chronic high blood pressure is the biggest single risk factor for alzheimer’s disease .PERIOD and of course ,COMMA when it comes to cognitive effects ,COMMA use it or lose it applies .PERIOD so you want to stay mentally stimulated .PERIOD and one of the first things that i started to investigate was the history of the name of technology ,COMMA and obviously technology had existed before then ,COMMA but we weren't aware of it .PERIOD and so it was sort of an awakening of this force in our life .PERIOD and that's the very first use of the word ,COMMA even the hunter-gatherers used ,COMMA some elementary tools .PERIOD so climate change is not a new thing .PERIOD and flowers and plants are the same thing :COLON extended .PERIOD and technology is basically an extension of life ,COMMA and the energy density that we see in the greatest of anywhere in the universe is actually in a pc chip .PERIOD and there are things moving towards greater complexity ,COMMA moving towards greater diversity ,COMMA moving towards greater specialization ,COMMA sentience ubiquity .PERIOD and most important evolvability .PERIOD those very same things are also present in technology .PERIOD he could buy things that king ,COMMA henry in all his wealth could never buy .PERIOD and what i mean by that is that we find a new job for it .PERIOD so better ideas is really -- .PERIOD always the response to technology that we don't like ,COMMA is basically better technology .PERIOD and so every technology is sort of a creative force looking for the right job .PERIOD and we are aware of the price .PERIOD great movement .PERIOD that is starting billions of years ago is moving through us ,COMMA and it continues to go and our choice .PERIOD so to speak in technology is really to align ourselves with this force ,COMMA much greater than ourselves .PERIOD i really appreciate your attention today .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD neil .PERIOD and i were sitting there ,COMMA comparing how little we've slept in anticipation for this .PERIOD i've never been so nervous -- .PERIOD and i do this .PERIOD when i'm nervous ,COMMA i just realized in the brooklyn neighborhood that i lived in park slope .PERIOD there are a lot of writers -- .PERIOD it's like a very high per capita ratio of writers to normal people .PERIOD so when i moved back to san francisco ,COMMA we rented this building .PERIOD so we thought we'll have all these writers and editors ,COMMA and everybody -- sort of a writing community -- coming into the office every day .PERIOD anyway ,COMMA why don't we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there ?QUESTIONMARK after school ,COMMA get extra help on their written homework ?QUESTIONMARK so you have basically no border between these two communities ,COMMA and we looked around ,COMMA and somebody else said ,COMMA well ,COMMA you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer .PERIOD this is replacement eyes .PERIOD in case ,COMMA you lose one while you're reading the sign .PERIOD we pull a rope behind the counter and eight mop heads drop on your head .PERIOD it became mop heads .PERIOD and this is the fish theater ,COMMA which is just a saltwater tank with three seats ,COMMA and then right behind it .PERIOD we set up this space ,COMMA which was the tutoring center .PERIOD and we thought ,COMMA oh ,COMMA they're going to storm the gates .PERIOD they're gonna love it .PERIOD and they didn't .PERIOD you know ,COMMA it's been proven that 35 to 40 hours a year with one-on-one attention .PERIOD a student can get one grade level higher ,COMMA but there was something psychological happening there that was just a little bit different .PERIOD they're allowed to go home at 530 ,COMMA pm ,COMMA enjoy their family .PERIOD enjoy other hobbies ,COMMA get outside play .PERIOD then we said ,COMMA well ,COMMA what are we going to do with the space during the day ?QUESTIONMARK because it has to be used before 230 pm .PERIOD so this is one of the books that they do .PERIOD so meanwhile ,COMMA there's an adult in the back typing this up taking it completely seriously ,COMMA which blows their mind .PERIOD it's right off the library .PERIOD and there we serve all 529 kids in this middle school ,COMMA you can see amy tan sponsored .PERIOD the next one i might get somewhere .PERIOD we sell all the student books .PERIOD they would say ,COMMA what is this ?QUESTIONMARK so the store actually did really well .PERIOD this is sam potts' ,COMMA great design that did this .PERIOD this is a little vault -- .PERIOD you have to put your product in there .PERIOD it goes up an electric lift .PERIOD and then the guy behind the counter tells you that you have to recite the vow of heroism ,COMMA which you do if you want to buy anything ,COMMA and it limits really their sales .PERIOD so then the secret door -- .PERIOD this is one of the shelves .PERIOD you don't see when you walk in .PERIOD but it slowly opens .PERIOD this is one of the students .PERIOD khaled hamdan came in got this concentrated attention .PERIOD i'm going to switch to we and not .PERIOD i hope we hope that the attendees of this conference will usher in a new era of participation in our public schools .PERIOD we hope that you will take the lead in partnering ,COMMA your innovative spirit ,COMMA and expertise with that of innovative educators in your community .PERIOD hot studio did a great job in a very tight deadline .PERIOD so visit the site .PERIOD i've been a priest in the church for 20 years .PERIOD do we really believe that god is the kind of male boss that we've been presenting in our worship ,COMMA and in our liturgies over all these years ,COMMA suggesting that god expresses himself or herself through powerlessness ,COMMA rather than power acknowledging that god is unknown and unknowable by definition .PERIOD and this is what i said ,COMMA and we want an explanation from god for hundreds of years .PERIOD the prevailing orthodoxy ,COMMA the accepted truth was that god ,COMMA the father ,COMMA the creator is unchanging .PERIOD and therefore ,COMMA by definition cannot feel pain or sadness ,COMMA and the devastating events of the 20th century have forced people to question the cold unfeeling ,COMMA god ,COMMA who is god in all this ?QUESTIONMARK do we have a local god ,COMMA who can do little things like parking spaces ,COMMA but not big things like 500 ,COMMA mile-per-hour waves .PERIOD that's just not acceptable to intelligent christians .PERIOD and we must acknowledge it ,COMMA you probably heard some of them ,COMMA the man who surfed the wave ,COMMA the teenage girl who recognized the danger ,COMMA because she had just been learning about tsunamis at school .PERIOD if we believe something like this ,COMMA we must let go of the puppet-master completely take our leave of the almighty controller ,COMMA abandon traditional models .PERIOD maybe god isn't an agent like all of us are agents .PERIOD the people knew their god by his mighty acts in the incredible intricacy and magnificence of the natural world .PERIOD in the end we have to say ,COMMA i don't know to have faith in this .PERIOD god would be more like trusting an essential benevolence in the universe ,COMMA and less like believing a system of doctrinal statements ,COMMA and how would one deepen such a faith ?QUESTIONMARK but in the end ,COMMA the only thing i could say ,COMMA for sure was ,COMMA i don't know .PERIOD and that just might be the most profoundly religious statement of all .PERIOD it was deep at night ,COMMA and i kept on staring at it until it disappeared .PERIOD this is not a story of a nameless survivor of war ,COMMA and nameless refugees whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers and our tv with tattered clothes ,COMMA dirty face scared eyes war .PERIOD a friend of mine said ,COMMA is not about sound at all .PERIOD it is actually about silence .PERIOD the silence of humanity ,COMMA i have since left iraq and founded a group called women for women ,COMMA international that ends up working with women survivors of wars .PERIOD she said ,COMMA but it's not fair because there is only one life .PERIOD and there should only be one death .PERIOD ninety percent of modern war casualties are civilians .PERIOD how interesting there is a side that is led by men .PERIOD and there is a side that is led by women .PERIOD there is no way we can talk about the building of stability .PERIOD if we don't start investing in women and girls ,COMMA she got into women for women international's program to start with these women that i told you about are dancing and singing every single day .PERIOD and if they can who are we not to dance by accepting this dichotomy ,COMMA whether it's tongue-in-cheek ,COMMA when we attempt to accommodate it in our world ,COMMA and we try to build our foundation for the world .PERIOD we're messing up the future because who wants to be uncreative ?QUESTIONMARK now ,COMMA i grew up in the '60s ,COMMA and i'll admit it ,COMMA actually ,COMMA my childhood spanned ,COMMA the '60s .PERIOD and i was a wannabe hippie .PERIOD and i always resented the fact that i wasn't really old enough to be a hippie .PERIOD and i know there are people here ,COMMA the younger generation who want to be hippies .PERIOD but people talk about the '60s all the time ,COMMA and they talk about the anarchy that was there .PERIOD but when i think about the '60s ,COMMA what i took away from it was that there was hope for the future .PERIOD you see ,COMMA i always assumed i would go into space because i followed all of this ,COMMA but i also loved the arts and sciences .PERIOD now ,COMMA my mother helped me figure that one out .PERIOD but when i went into space ,COMMA when i went into space ,COMMA i carried a number of things up with me .PERIOD i carried a poster by alvin ailey ,COMMA which you can figure out .PERIOD now ,COMMA i love the dance company ,COMMA and yeah ,COMMA sub-atomic physics is deconstructive .PERIOD you literally try to tear atoms apart to understand what's inside of them .PERIOD but sculpture from what i understand from great sculptors is deconstructive ,COMMA because you see a piece ,COMMA and you remove what doesn't need to be there .PERIOD it's the universe as experienced by everyone and the arts manifest our desire .PERIOD our attempt to share or influence others ,COMMA through experiences that are peculiar to us as individuals .PERIOD do you know these books these such and such for dummies ?QUESTIONMARK but i was looking online at amazoncom for other books like this .PERIOD there's a sort of business model around being stupid in some sense .PERIOD i was in milan last week for the italian launch .PERIOD so it was traumatizing .PERIOD actually modernism means white box ,COMMA and it's a perfect white box .PERIOD i have a default title as a father of a bunch of daughters as a child .PERIOD we used to wake up at 1 ,COMMA am and work till 6 pm six days a week .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD but the media lab is an interesting place .PERIOD and it's important to me because as a student ,COMMA i was a computer science undergrad .PERIOD and i discovered design later on in my life .PERIOD and there was this person ,COMMA muriel cooper .PERIOD it was the best advice i ever got .PERIOD so i went to art school because of her ,COMMA i think that the mentors that we all meet sort of humanize us .PERIOD so if you sort of compare that like this ,COMMA you'll see that computer versus human -- .PERIOD i've been tracking this for the last year -- computer versus human over .PERIOD the last year has changed .PERIOD i spent my entire early career making complex stuff ,COMMA lots of complex stuff .PERIOD this is a floral theme calendar in 1997 .PERIOD and this is a firework calendar .PERIOD so you launch the number into space ,COMMA because the japanese believe that when you see fireworks ,COMMA you're cooler for some reason i've been lucky to have been there before people made these kind of things .PERIOD and so i made all this kind of stuff that messes with your eyes and eye meat is something different ,COMMA something more fibrous ,COMMA something more powerful ,COMMA perhaps ,COMMA but what could that be eye meat ?QUESTIONMARK so i went back to the computer ,COMMA and i bought five large fries and scanned them all .PERIOD and i was looking for some kind of food theme .PERIOD and i wrote some software to automatically lay out french-fry images .PERIOD and also as a child ,COMMA i was the fattest kid in class .PERIOD so i used to love cheetos .PERIOD oh ,COMMA i love cheetos yummy .PERIOD i discovered that cheetos are good .PERIOD expressive material .PERIOD it's a strange business model .PERIOD i can come into work everyday and staple .PERIOD five pieces of paper and just stare at it with my latte in japan .PERIOD they say that sushi is challenging this book .PERIOD i wrote because i want to figure out life .PERIOD he's an expert in aging .PERIOD this horizontal axis is how old you are -- twelve years old .PERIOD twenty-four years ,COMMA old ,COMMA seventy-four ,COMMA ninety-six years ,COMMA old -- .PERIOD and this is some medical data .PERIOD so brain strength increases up to 60 .PERIOD and then after 60 ,COMMA it sort of goes down kind of depressing in a way .PERIOD your social responsibility is very interesting .PERIOD how dare we be optimistic ?QUESTIONMARK but as important as it is to change the lightbulbs ,COMMA it is more important to change the laws .PERIOD and there are lots of those .PERIOD but the climate crisis is the rare ,COMMA but all-important ,COMMA global or strategic conflict .PERIOD greenland remains twenty-eight years ago .PERIOD this is what the polar ice cap -- .PERIOD the north polar ice .PERIOD cap -- looked like at the end of the summer at the fall equinox .PERIOD this last fall ,COMMA i went to the snow and ice data center in boulder ,COMMA colorado and talked to the researchers here in monterey at the naval postgraduate laboratory .PERIOD the north polar ice ,COMMA cap is the same size .PERIOD geographically -- doesn't look quite the same size -- ,COMMA but it is exactly the same size as the united states ,COMMA minus an area ,COMMA roughly equal to the state of arizona .PERIOD they have exactly the same amount of carbon .PERIOD what is missing is a sense of urgency .PERIOD nbc -- .PERIOD i'll show all of the networks here .PERIOD -- .PERIOD the top journalists for nbc asked 956 questions in 2007 of the presidential candidates .PERIOD two of them were about the climate crisis .PERIOD abc 844 questions .PERIOD two about the climate crisis .PERIOD this is gasoline consumption in all of these countries and us we have the technologies .PERIOD we have to have a unified view of how to go about this ,COMMA the struggle against poverty in the world ,COMMA and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions .PERIOD all has a single very simple solution ,COMMA but responses can actually make a huge difference in the poor countries .PERIOD this is a proposal that has been talked about a lot in europe lot of other things contributed to it .PERIOD but the new prime minister announced that his very first priority would be to change australia's position on kyoto .PERIOD and he has now they came to an awareness ,COMMA partly because of the horrible drought that they have had ,COMMA but we have a planetary emergency if we had just one week's worth of what we spend on the iraq war .PERIOD we could be well on the way to solving this challenge .PERIOD this challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization ,COMMA demand -- change the light bulbs ,COMMA but change the laws change ,COMMA the global treaties .PERIOD now ,COMMA nobody is talking on that scale .PERIOD but i do believe that between now and november ,COMMA it is possible in terms of your own personal role .PERIOD going forward .PERIOD al is there something more than that .PERIOD you would like to be doing al gore .PERIOD thank you so much for coming to ted .PERIOD and that's certainly how it seemed to me .PERIOD when i started this project ,COMMA all this noise around us actually has information .PERIOD so what i started thinking was perhaps there is something like open source intelligence here .PERIOD so we started doing this ,COMMA and you can see here on the horizontal axis ,COMMA you've got the number of people killed in an attack or the size of the attack .PERIOD you take all of the conflict ,COMMA all of the chaos ,COMMA all of the noise .PERIOD and out of that comes this precise mathematical distribution of the way attacks are ordered in this conflict .PERIOD and we found that not only were the distributions these straight lines .PERIOD but the slope of these lines they clustered around this value of alpha equals 25 ,COMMA and we could generate an equation that could predict the likelihood of an attack .PERIOD this is data statistics .PERIOD what does it tell us about these conflicts ?QUESTIONMARK turns out we kind of do a reasonable job .PERIOD so what's going on ?QUESTIONMARK why should these different -- ,COMMA seemingly different conflicts ,COMMA have the same patterns ?QUESTIONMARK what does it look like ?QUESTIONMARK we can push it up .PERIOD the forces become more fragmented .PERIOD there is more of them ,COMMA but they are weaker .PERIOD the opposite happened .PERIOD the groups became stronger ,COMMA but designers are great at taking big revolutions that happen and transforming them so that we can use them .PERIOD you work over different time zones .PERIOD you talk to very different people .PERIOD you multitask .PERIOD we all know it .PERIOD and we do it kind of automatically .PERIOD and all of a sudden scientists are seeking designers .PERIOD just like designers are seeking scientists ,COMMA and keith has come and also jonathan has come and many others .PERIOD and it was great ,COMMA because at the beginning was this apology fest -- ,COMMA you know ,COMMA scientists would tell designers ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i don't know what style is .PERIOD i'm not really elegant .PERIOD paul steinhardt ,COMMA a physicist from new york and aranda/lasch architects collaborated in an installation in london .PERIOD at the serpentine .PERIOD i'm showing to you different sections of the show right now ,COMMA just to give you a taste of it .PERIOD in this case ,COMMA i'm showing more the designers' work ,COMMA because they're the ones that have really been stimulated .PERIOD but the problem is that it's a really ugly patty when you don't have to kill cows ,COMMA and it can have any shape .PERIOD what should it be like ?QUESTIONMARK one of the most important topics of the show -- ,COMMA you know ,COMMA as anything in our life today ,COMMA we can look at it from many many different viewpoints ,COMMA and at different levels .PERIOD one of the most interesting and most important concepts is the idea of scale .PERIOD we change scale very often .PERIOD we change resolution of screens ,COMMA and we're not really fazed by it .PERIOD we do it very comfortably ?QUESTIONMARK you can be in the subway ,COMMA and you can be completely isolated and have your own room in your ipod again ,COMMA this communal sense of experience that seems to be so important today .PERIOD and so this student at the rca designed this beautiful blown-glass object ,COMMA where the bees move from one chamber to the other ,COMMA if they detect that particular smell that signifies in this case ,COMMA pregnancy design for debate is a very interesting new endeavor that designers have really shaped for themselves .PERIOD and usually they are accompanied by videos .PERIOD it's quite amazing how these things can make you smile can make .PERIOD you laugh can make you cry .PERIOD sometimes .PERIOD thank you very much .PERIOD the only trouble is the people next door .PERIOD i can't stand them .PERIOD and yet ,COMMA if i just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings ,COMMA i wouldn't be doing my job -- ,COMMA because i have to actually be there for them and make sure that rituals happen that practicalities are seen to who cannot be touched by compassion ,COMMA when we see the terrible horrors of the results of war or famine ,COMMA or earthquakes ,COMMA or tsunamis .PERIOD and of course ,COMMA you can't do that unless you understand yourself a bit more ,COMMA therefore ,COMMA there should be justice throughout the world .PERIOD so like snoopy ,COMMA we can't just lie there ,COMMA and think great thoughts about our neighbors .PERIOD there has to be a willingness to do good deeds .PERIOD but not ,COMMA of course ,COMMA at the expense of our own sanity .PERIOD what does this compassion entail ?QUESTIONMARK and as many people do ,COMMA he was dozing off during the sermon ,COMMA and he rushed home .PERIOD and after the sabbath ,COMMA he made 12 loaves of bread ,COMMA took them to the synagogue ,COMMA went into the synagogue ,COMMA opened the ark and said ,COMMA god ,COMMA i don't know why you want this bread .PERIOD but here you are ,COMMA and he called the two of them to his office .PERIOD you mean ,COMMA god didn't want my bread .PERIOD and the rabbi said ,COMMA you've misunderstood me ,COMMA you've misunderstood ,COMMA totally .PERIOD he said ,COMMA please keep your seat wrap it in an ace bandage ,COMMA take some ibuprofen for a week or two .PERIOD and that's the end of the story .PERIOD how can the nervous system get this so wrong in your house wires run in the wall from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling .PERIOD and from the junction box to the light bulb ,COMMA it's almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired ,COMMA your walls .PERIOD so that the next time you turned on the light switch ,COMMA the toilet flushed three doors down ,COMMA or your dishwasher went on ,COMMA or your computer monitor turned off .PERIOD if you look out your window ,COMMA and you can see long's peak .PERIOD you're probably familiar with it .PERIOD take meeker mt ,COMMA meeker lump that in there and put that in space as well and mt ,COMMA everest and k2 .PERIOD and the indian peaks because back then video cameras were just starting to become popular ,COMMA and people would bring them .PERIOD parents would bring them to their kids' football games to film their kids play football .PERIOD and since this came in on a friday ,COMMA they were able to get this great footage of this thing breaking up as it came in over west virgina ,COMMA maryland ,COMMA pennsylvania and new jersey until it did that to a car in new york .PERIOD this did a huge amount of damage .PERIOD the one over tunguska was probably made of rock ,COMMA and that's much more crumbly .PERIOD so it blew up in the air either way .PERIOD these are tremendous explosions 20 megatons .PERIOD i don't think apophis is a problem .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA apophis is a blessing in disguise ,COMMA because it woke us up to the dangers of these things .PERIOD well ,COMMA let me ask you ,COMMA what happens if you're standing in the middle of the road and a car's headed for you ?QUESTIONMARK what do you do you do this ?QUESTIONMARK i think even nasa can do that .PERIOD and they proved that they can after the big macho ,COMMA rrrrrrr ,COMMA bam .PERIOD we're gonna hit this thing in the face .PERIOD then we bring in the velvet gloves .PERIOD there's a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts ,COMMA and they call themselves the b612 foundation .PERIOD for those of you who've read the little prince ,COMMA you understand that reference .PERIOD i hope the little prince who lived on an asteroid .PERIOD it was called b612 .PERIOD so think about this right now .PERIOD those of you who are lucky enough to live in those societies that represent 17 percent .PERIOD i think should enjoy it until it lasts .PERIOD my story starts -- .PERIOD the story i want to share -- starts in 1991 .PERIOD the problem was that we had to re-tape that history a week later ,COMMA because if we did not ,COMMA we could not afford enough tapes to keep archives of that history .PERIOD so here we are having our first client brilliant .PERIOD it's a kind of very nice ,COMMA sophisticated way ,COMMA how to economically strangle a daily newspaper .PERIOD and we said ,COMMA that's fine .PERIOD let's meet .PERIOD you'll bring us your business plan ,COMMA which eventually they did .PERIOD we start the meeting ,COMMA but however ,COMMA you put it ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the numbers do not make any sense .PERIOD we were the best that they could do .PERIOD we do it in 17 countries of the developing world .PERIOD so what the governor got was an empty shell .PERIOD so from that perspective ,COMMA what we did is just really one drop in the sea of that need that we can identify .PERIOD imagine two thirds over here ,COMMA running excellent organizations doing very important work .PERIOD now ,COMMA imagine that every second person over here is deaf ,COMMA does not hear and switch the lights off .PERIOD so we thought that some kind of a big idea is needed to reform to totally rethink fundraising .PERIOD and then two weeks later iqbal quadir can issue his electricity in bangladesh bonds .PERIOD so indeed ,COMMA i have spent my life looking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive .PERIOD so since i tell stories ,COMMA let me look back on the lives of two of the presidents .PERIOD i've studied to illustrate this point ,COMMA -- abraham lincoln and lyndon johnson .PERIOD but he read books in every spare moment he could find three things had combined to lay him low .PERIOD he was so depressed that friends worried .PERIOD he was suicidal .PERIOD and his great friend speed went to his side and said ,COMMA lincoln ,COMMA you must rally ,COMMA or you will die .PERIOD and with a beauty of language ,COMMA -- almost as if the shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child ,COMMA had worked their way into his very soul .PERIOD knowing that tolstoy was in their midst .PERIOD they asked him to tell stories of the great men of history .PERIOD but instead surprisingly ,COMMA he said ,COMMA oh bring her down here for a year .PERIOD and if i can't win her over ,COMMA no one can ,COMMA but they were great nonetheless .PERIOD but i also worried that part of it was that i was then a young woman .PERIOD and there was wine and cheese and a red-checked tablecloth -- ,COMMA all the romantic trappings .PERIOD and the british people were still upset about losing the revolution .PERIOD so they decided to embarrass him a little bit by putting a huge picture of general washington in the only outhouse where he'd have to encounter it ,COMMA which allows me from the beginning of spring training to the end of the fall to have something to occupy my mind and heart other than my work .PERIOD but it so happened .PERIOD he was speaking in a protestant church .PERIOD so i went to my father in tears .PERIOD what are we going to do ?QUESTIONMARK i tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church ,COMMA wishing harm to others being mean to my sisters .PERIOD well ,COMMA here's an example from my own experience .PERIOD there are lots of people who believe that ,COMMA and i think it is utter baloney .PERIOD i think that's the main point to be made .PERIOD and i won't go into a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics ,COMMA and what it's like .PERIOD and so on .PERIOD there are even movies about it with a lot of wrong stuff .PERIOD and in a lot of familiar cases they ,COMMA of course ,COMMA are so it's not a theory of everything .PERIOD and in fact ,COMMA a huge amount of the information in the universe around us comes from those accidents and not just from the fundamental laws .PERIOD you know what ?QUESTIONMARK it means .PERIOD a circle ,COMMA for example ,COMMA is symmetric under rotations about the center of the circle .PERIOD maxwell's equations are of course ,COMMA symmetrical under rotations of all of space .PERIOD the next -- second -- equation says that there is no magnetism other than that .PERIOD so here we say ,COMMA again ,COMMA what we said before that ,COMMA each skin of the onion shows a similarity to the adjoining skins ,COMMA and therefore it looks beautiful ,COMMA because we already know how to write it in a lovely concise way ,COMMA steps toward unification ,COMMA exhibit the simplicity symmetry exhibits the simplicity .PERIOD now ,COMMA who today would claim that as a mere conceit of the human mind ,COMMA they are what we call emergent properties .PERIOD you don't need -- .PERIOD you don't need something more to get something more life can emerge from physics and chemistry ,COMMA plus a lot of accidents ,COMMA the things we make have one supreme quality -- .PERIOD they live longer than us .PERIOD we perish ,COMMA they survive .PERIOD we have one life .PERIOD they have many lives .PERIOD and in each life ,COMMA they can mean different things .PERIOD the central element still of the notion of return ,COMMA a central part of the life of judaism .PERIOD all of those are respected by cyrus .PERIOD it left a dream of the middle east as a unit and a unit where people of different faiths could live together for them .PERIOD of course ,COMMA it can't possibly by marduk that made all this happen .PERIOD and it's quite clear .PERIOD the cylinder is older than the text of isaiah .PERIOD and yet jehovah is speaking in words very similar to those used by marduk .PERIOD the state of israel is setup .PERIOD and 50 years later ,COMMA in the late 60s ,COMMA it's clear that britain's role as the imperial power is over .PERIOD it's shown being presented here ,COMMA put into its case by the director of the national museum of tehran ,COMMA one of the many women in iran in very senior positions ,COMMA mrs ardakani .PERIOD and it's the subject of a huge debate about what this cylinder means ,COMMA what cyrus means .PERIOD but above all cyrus ,COMMA as articulated through this cylinder ,COMMA -- cyrus as the defender of the homeland ,COMMA the champion ,COMMA of course ,COMMA of iranian identity ,COMMA and of the iranian peoples ,COMMA tolerant of all faiths ,COMMA will iran set free ?QUESTIONMARK the people that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated a replica of this is at the united nations .PERIOD but i think it's possible that the most powerful and the wisest voice of all of them may .PERIOD well be the voice of this mute thing .PERIOD the cyrus cylinder making sense of those things is a very difficult thing to do .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA i have got qualifications .PERIOD so i started thinking about peace .PERIOD and i was obviously ,COMMA as i said to you very much moved by these images ,COMMA trying to make sense of that .PERIOD could i go and speak to older and wiser ,COMMA people ,COMMA who would tell me how they made sense of the things that are going on .PERIOD and that was when i had the idea there was no day of global unity .PERIOD and that's why we wanted it to be the 21st of september as the date of peace .PERIOD could you give me a flight because we're going to go see him ?QUESTIONMARK and of course ,COMMA we went and saw him ,COMMA and it was amazing and just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing .PERIOD and really empowering actually ,COMMA and we were listening to everybody and working with ngos and building this case .PERIOD i felt that i was presenting a case on behalf of the global community to try and create this day .PERIOD and this young child who'd taken about an inch and a half out of her leg with no antiseptic .PERIOD and that young boy ,COMMA who was a child soldier who told me he'd killed people -- .PERIOD he was about 12 -- .PERIOD these things made me realize that this was not a film that i could just stop .PERIOD if this is the only film that i ever make .PERIOD i'm going to document until this becomes a reality ,COMMA the costa rican government .PERIOD and the british government had put forward to the united nations .PERIOD general assembly with 54 co-sponsors ,COMMA the idea of the first ever ceasefire nonviolence day ,COMMA the 21st of september as a fixed calendar date .PERIOD and it was unanimously adopted by every head of state in the world .PERIOD and as i mentioned ,COMMA when it started ,COMMA we were at the globe .PERIOD and there was no press ,COMMA it's been created .PERIOD nobody knows ,COMMA but we have to continue this journey .PERIOD and we have to tell people ,COMMA and we have to prove it can work .PERIOD and after lots and lots of meetings ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA i'm delighted that this man ahmad fawzi ,COMMA one of my heroes and mentors ,COMMA really ,COMMA he managed to get unicef involved .PERIOD and i saw him because he was an actor .PERIOD i was an actor .PERIOD i had a connection to him because we needed to get to the press .PERIOD we needed this attraction .PERIOD we needed the media to be involved ,COMMA because if we start pumping it up a bit ,COMMA maybe more people would listen .PERIOD and there'd be more -- when we got into certain areas ,COMMA maybe there would be more people interested .PERIOD i won't go into that .PERIOD so jude said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA i'll do some statements for you .PERIOD and i could sort of see a little look in his eye of interest .PERIOD so these guys were absolutely crucial .PERIOD this amazing woman :COLON fatima gailani was absolutely instrumental in what went on as she was the spokesperson for the resistance against the russians .PERIOD and her afghan network was just absolutely everywhere .PERIOD we will observe this day .PERIOD we see it as a window of opportunity .PERIOD and so then we wrapped the film up ,COMMA and we put it together because we had to go back .PERIOD and we wanted to go back and show them the film and say ,COMMA look ,COMMA you guys made this possible .PERIOD and thank you very much .PERIOD and i kept thinking about this 70 percent 70 percent reduction in violence ,COMMA -- in what everyone said was completely impossible .PERIOD and you couldn't do .PERIOD he's an amazing man .PERIOD it's all about the individuals .PERIOD and it then made me think about a glass of water ,COMMA which is clear .PERIOD thank you very much .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD there was not a flashlight ,COMMA not a lantern ,COMMA not a candle .PERIOD -- pitch ,COMMA black anesthetic wears off the patient feels pain .PERIOD and her recommendation is take this opportunity to fire .PERIOD everyone start all over again .PERIOD now ,COMMA what does this have to do with leadership ?QUESTIONMARK they are the elite .PERIOD they are our leaders ,COMMA and we need to train them right ?QUESTIONMARK and one day .PERIOD i go to the airport to meet my father .PERIOD and as i walk up this grassy slope from the car park to the terminal building ,COMMA i'm stopped by two soldiers ,COMMA wielding ak-47 ,COMMA assault weapons .PERIOD so a few years after this event ,COMMA i leave ghana on a scholarship to go to swarthmore college for my education .PERIOD they wanted us to be analytical .PERIOD they wanted us to be concerned about social issues .PERIOD it was brilliant ,COMMA somebody trained them to do the work that they do .PERIOD now .PERIOD we cannot achieve perfection .PERIOD but if we reach for it ,COMMA then we can achieve excellence .PERIOD i don't know ultimately what they will do .PERIOD but the conversation they're having now -- about what their good society should look like what their excellent society should look like ,COMMA is a really good thing .PERIOD now i just wanted to leave that slide up because it's important that we think about it .PERIOD i am even more thrilled by the fact that least year our student body ,COMMA elected a woman to be the head of student government .PERIOD it's the first time in the history of ghana that a woman has been elected head of student government at any university .PERIOD it says ,COMMA a lot about her peers who elected her .PERIOD my job is to make arms and legs -- .PERIOD well ,COMMA it's not completely true ,COMMA and then not only for war victims .PERIOD but it was for any kind of patient .PERIOD i was also working in the orthopedic center .PERIOD we call it ,COMMA but it was a terrific job .PERIOD so the orthopedic center was closed ,COMMA because physical rehabilitation was not considered a priority .PERIOD anyway ,COMMA you know ,COMMA every time i make this speech -- .PERIOD it's not the first time -- ,COMMA but it's an emotion .PERIOD i wanted to go home .PERIOD i was driving ,COMMA and everybody disappeared from the street .PERIOD the man was without legs and only with one arm .PERIOD and i ask ,COMMA what are you doing out in the street in this situation ?QUESTIONMARK and then i said ,COMMA oh my god ,COMMA what did i say he was coming every day crossing the front line ?QUESTIONMARK two groups of mujahideen started fighting .PERIOD so we dashed all of us towards the shelter .PERIOD everybody was grabbing something ,COMMA and i will never forget mahmoud and his son walking together ,COMMA pushing the empty wheelchair .PERIOD i don't want them to be teased at school by the other students .PERIOD i said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA and then he sat down .PERIOD so the only things i could manage to obtain was a kind of a compromise .PERIOD i understood that i was wrong again .PERIOD and then we started a new policy -- ,COMMA a new policy ,COMMA completely different .PERIOD we decided to employ as many disabled as possible to train them in any possible job .PERIOD i said ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA we can't .PERIOD and you should see me during the match .PERIOD i shout like a true italian in this image of the tokyo skyline .PERIOD i've hidden data from the newest planet-hunting space telescope on the block .PERIOD the kepler mission there we go ,COMMA and we can measure this very ,COMMA very precisely with kepler and trace their effects wrong .PERIOD i'm not looking at you .PERIOD i can't see you .PERIOD i have to do something now ,COMMA which seems a little bit strange for a magician .PERIOD oh ,COMMA they gladly sell you that .PERIOD yes .PERIOD but the one thing that has made a big comeback just recently is this business of speaking with the dead .PERIOD i don't think so ,COMMA because this subculture of people use exactly the same gimmicks that we magicians do exactly the same -- ,COMMA the same physical methods the same psychological methods -- ,COMMA and they effectively and profoundly deceive millions of people around the earth to their detriment good bye .PERIOD the second question that i'd like to ask rather simple .PERIOD suppose i ask them to contact the spirit of my deceased father-in-law ,COMMA as an example ,COMMA is this a hunting game ,COMMA but it is a cruel vicious absolutely conscienceless -- .PERIOD i'll be all right ,COMMA keep your seats -- game that these people play folks .PERIOD that's what dying is all about .PERIOD now ,COMMA it may bring a certain amount of comfort ,COMMA but that comfort lasts only about 20 minutes ,COMMA or so .PERIOD we all know who he is on television .PERIOD he's well educated .PERIOD he's smart .PERIOD he knows what sylvia browne is doing ,COMMA but he doesn't give a damn .PERIOD because the bottom line is the sponsors love it ,COMMA and he will expose her to television publicity all the time now ,COMMA without that ,COMMA how could we possibly function ?QUESTIONMARK she gives you the names of previous lives who you were in previous lives .PERIOD duh ,COMMA nothing is ever said about a 14 year-old bootblack in the streets of london ,COMMA who died of consumption all the more reason to take the million dollars .PERIOD wouldn't you think sylvia ?QUESTIONMARK why don't they affect me ?QUESTIONMARK now folks ,COMMA this is not just a metaphor .PERIOD i'm going to give you now .PERIOD it's true and another claim that they make -- .PERIOD you'll love this one -- ,COMMA the more dilute .PERIOD the medicine is ,COMMA they say ,COMMA the more powerful .PERIOD it is largely .PERIOD it's the media who are to blame for this sort of thing .PERIOD it's the bottom line the dollar line .PERIOD now ,COMMA we've offered this carrot ,COMMA as i say ,COMMA we've dangled the carrot .PERIOD ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA i'm james randi ,COMMA and i'm waiting .PERIOD and one of the major gaps in care ,COMMA almost across the board is access to safe surgery in the background .PERIOD there is a very sophisticated anesthesia machine .PERIOD in order to operate .PERIOD this machine needs a number of things that this hospital has to offer .PERIOD and finally ,COMMA i think you can see that infrastructure is not very strong .PERIOD similarly ,COMMA compressed oxygen .PERIOD and other medical supplies are really a luxury and can often be out of stock for months ,COMMA or even a year .PERIOD one of our partners at johns hopkins was observing surgeries in sierra leone about a year ago .PERIOD and the first surgery of the day happened to be an obstetrical case .PERIOD and everything began pretty auspiciously .PERIOD my colleague dr .PERIOD paul fenton was living this reality .PERIOD he went to work every day in an operating theater ,COMMA like this one trying to deliver anesthesia and teach others how to do so using that same equipment that became so unreliable and frankly ,COMMA unsafe in his hospital .PERIOD but this gives control to the provider ,COMMA whether there's power or not ,COMMA because they can adjust the flow based on the percentage of oxygen .PERIOD they see that they're giving their patient .PERIOD this is in 13 hospitals in four countries .PERIOD and since 2010 ,COMMA we've done well over 2000 surgeries with no clinically adverse events .PERIOD so we're thrilled because only once before has the fate of individual people and the fate of all of humanity ,COMMA been so intertwined ,COMMA maybe a few lung diseases here and there .PERIOD but ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that's not such a big deal ,COMMA but back to animals and junk food .PERIOD two ,COMMA both have been marketed heavily creating unnatural demand .PERIOD and they do this here .PERIOD it's the same deal .PERIOD that's just the united states .PERIOD there were no restaurant chains ,COMMA fats carbs ,COMMA proteins -- .PERIOD they weren't bad or good .PERIOD they were food .PERIOD the south and west became agricultural hubs .PERIOD and in other parts of the country suburbs took over farmland ,COMMA if we had a slide of salisbury steak ,COMMA even more .PERIOD so right ,COMMA thanks to farm subsidies .PERIOD the fine collaboration between agribusiness and congress ,COMMA soy corn .PERIOD and cattle became king ,COMMA not that they were any good ,COMMA but they were there for dessert store-bought ice cream or cookies .PERIOD so now you've got your pizza nights .PERIOD you've got your microwave nights .PERIOD you've got your grazing nights .PERIOD you've got your fend-for-yourself nights and so on meat ,COMMA junk food ,COMMA cheese ,COMMA the very stuff that will kill you .PERIOD so now we clamor for organic food .PERIOD i don't know ann cooper's ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK the usda is not our ally here .PERIOD cruelty .PERIOD i knew that the 10 billion animals we raise each year for meat are raised in factory farm conditions that we hypocritically wouldn't even consider for our own cats ,COMMA dogs and other pets .PERIOD so why was i stalling best of all ?QUESTIONMARK i'm healthier .PERIOD i know that i'm going to live longer .PERIOD and i've even lost a little weight .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD some of these have already been touched upon by other speakers ,COMMA which is encouraging .PERIOD the first is -- .PERIOD death is a big problem .PERIOD sometimes we don't see a problem because either it's too familiar ,COMMA or it's too big .PERIOD people like -- .PERIOD it's roughly the population in this room has just died .PERIOD suppose we approximated one person with one book .PERIOD so that's the first big problem .PERIOD well ,COMMA let's first look at the probability -- .PERIOD and this is very ,COMMA very difficult to estimate -- .PERIOD but there have been only four studies on this in recent years ,COMMA which is surprising .PERIOD he estimated a probability that we will fail to survive .PERIOD the current century 50 percent .PERIOD another author doesn't give any numerical estimate ,COMMA but says ,COMMA the probability is significant that it will fail .PERIOD now ,COMMA if we think about what just reducing the probability of human extinction ,COMMA by just one percentage point -- ,COMMA not very much -- .PERIOD so that's equivalent to 60 million lives saved .PERIOD if we just count the currently living people ,COMMA the current generation .PERIOD the only thing you should focus on would be to reduce existential risk ,COMMA because even the tiniest decrease in existential risk would just overwhelm any other benefit you could hope to achieve .PERIOD and even if you just look at the current people and ignore the potential that would be lost if we went extinct ,COMMA it should still have a high priority .PERIOD we were very successful .PERIOD we might end up with something like this ,COMMA which is -- .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA it's a heck of a lot better than that .PERIOD and they also all seem a little bit -- .PERIOD most people have this instinct that well sure there needs to be anti-depressants for the really depressed people ,COMMA intellectual capacity -- .PERIOD let's take that box ,COMMA which falls into a lot of different sub-categories .PERIOD memory concentration mental energy ,COMMA intelligence ,COMMA empathy ,COMMA able to switch back and forth .PERIOD more easily would be a neat thing to be able to do -- easier to achieve the flow state .PERIOD when you're totally immersed in something you are doing ,COMMA if you could actually choose to preserve your romantic attachments to one person undiminished through time .PERIOD so that wouldn't have to -- .PERIOD love would never have to fade if you didn't want it to might be more complicated in humans .PERIOD but perhaps not that much .PERIOD well ,COMMA we know already that in this little human circle there ,COMMA there are these enormously wonderful and worthwhile modes of being -- human life at its best is wonderful .PERIOD we have no reason to believe that within this much much larger space .PERIOD there would not also be extremely worthwhile modes of being ,COMMA perhaps ones that would be way beyond our wildest ability ,COMMA even to imagine or dream about .PERIOD and so to fix this third problem ,COMMA i think we need -- slowly carefully with ethical wisdom and constraint ,COMMA -- develop .PERIOD the means that enable us to go out in this larger space and explore it and find the great values that might hide there .PERIOD the sun end was about four inches in diameter ,COMMA and then it tapered over about 35 feet to about a millimeter at the earth end .PERIOD so i got it down to just one tether to be able to support that .PERIOD so many forces there ,COMMA if i throw a very concentric circle or concentric ellipse ,COMMA it just dutifully makes these evenly spaced lines ,COMMA which get closer and closer together ,COMMA which describes how gravity works .PERIOD because since it has the ability to make forms that look like forms that we're familiar with in biology .PERIOD it's also making other forms that we're not familiar with .PERIOD oh ,COMMA let's hope .PERIOD so oh ,COMMA my god ,COMMA let's .PERIOD and i think nature wants to express itself in the sense that we are nature .PERIOD humans are of the universe ,COMMA and we are expressions of the universe .PERIOD basically ,COMMA as humans ,COMMA ultimately ,COMMA being part of the universe ,COMMA we're kind of the spokespeople or the observer ,COMMA part of the constituency of the universe ,COMMA and to interface with it with a device that lets these forces that are everywhere act and show what they can do ,COMMA giving them pigment and paint just like an artist .PERIOD it's a good ally .PERIOD it's become an art form ,COMMA a form of sculpture .PERIOD but even more importantly ,COMMA he created a language a way we could communicate a code of dots ,COMMA dashes and arrows .PERIOD this is an origami ,COMMA figure -- one sheet ,COMMA no cuts ,COMMA folding only hundreds of folds .PERIOD this too is origami .PERIOD and this shows where we've gone in the modern world .PERIOD you can get horns antlers -- .PERIOD even if you look close ,COMMA cloven ,COMMA hooves .PERIOD and what changed is something you might not have expected in an art ,COMMA which is math .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA a stag beetle -- .PERIOD it's got two points for jaws .PERIOD it's got antennae .PERIOD can you be that specific in the detail ?QUESTIONMARK if i make the flaps skinnier ?QUESTIONMARK i can use a bit less paper .PERIOD and i can use those patterns now to create origami shapes do a little more complicated instrument .PERIOD and he used it to design this solar array the telescope going up in space .PERIOD it unfolds in two places .PERIOD the design called for geosynchronous orbit .PERIOD 25000 miles up .PERIOD 100-meter diameter lens and rockets are small .PERIOD so you have to make it smaller .PERIOD but this pattern's ,COMMA not going to work to get something 100 meters down to a few meters ,COMMA and they want to do their design by simulation ,COMMA and as weird and surprising as it may sound .PERIOD origami may someday even save a life .PERIOD now ,COMMA ecstasy in greek meant simply to stand to the side of something you can't understand more than two people talking to you .PERIOD and it has become a kind of a truism in the study of creativity that you can't be creating anything with less than 10 years of technical-knowledge immersion in a particular field ,COMMA whether it's mathematics or music .PERIOD it takes that long to be able to begin to change something in a way that it's better than what was there before you see that these people define success as something that helps others .PERIOD and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it .PERIOD the other combinations of challenge and skill become progressively less optimal .PERIOD and that is the kind of challenge that we're trying to understand ,COMMA not a lot of women did the '20s ,COMMA and the '60s also come to mind .PERIOD this is really just about the facts of this economic moment that we live in this second set of headlines -- .PERIOD you can see that families and marriages are starting to shift .PERIOD and so they decided because they were intrigued by this finding to do a nationwide survey .PERIOD so they spread out all the census data .PERIOD and what they found the guy described to me as a shocker ,COMMA which is that in 1997 out of 2000 communities ,COMMA women young women were making more money than young men .PERIOD watch what happens to the women .PERIOD watch what happens to the men .PERIOD it looks like women got some power boost on a video game ,COMMA or like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth-control pills that lets them shoot up high .PERIOD what it's about is that the economy has changed a lot .PERIOD so that's childcare elder care and food preparation .PERIOD and some people say it's because in 9th ,COMMA grade boys start dropping out of school .PERIOD basically ,COMMA the way they said it to me is that they would be working 18 hours a day that their husband would maybe have a job .PERIOD but that mostly ,COMMA he would be at home taking care of the kiddies .PERIOD and this was kind of a shocker to me .PERIOD they basically enshrined the second-class status of women in the civil code for one thing .PERIOD it puts men and women in a really antagonistic relationship with one another ,COMMA because the men are these devious tricksters up there who've put up this glass ceiling .PERIOD so the image that i like to think of instead of glass ceiling is the high bridge .PERIOD there's no man or woman standing in the middle about to cut the cables to the dismay of my mother .PERIOD this is dangerous teenage fashion ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK there really make a fully integrated product ,COMMA something beautiful .PERIOD this baby is fully electric .PERIOD all the projections [say that] .PERIOD this one [billion] will [only] grow with one to two or three percent [but .PERIOD this second] grows with seven eight percent .PERIOD and then they will end up here .PERIOD they will start flying because we already have this [growth] in process .PERIOD the year is 1960 .PERIOD can you see as the years pass by child survival is increasing .PERIOD it's only by child survival that we will stop population growth in the front .PERIOD you see ,COMMA actually joe murray getting the patient ready for the transplant while in the back room ,COMMA you see hartwell harrison ,COMMA the chief of urology at harvard actually harvesting the kidney that really has to do with our aging population .PERIOD it's not really that foreign of a concept .PERIOD actually ,COMMA it happens on the earth every day .PERIOD so your body is constantly regenerating .PERIOD so how can we harness that power ?QUESTIONMARK that's exactly what you see here to the naked eye .PERIOD they look like a piece of your blouse or your shirt ,COMMA but actually these materials are fairly complex ,COMMA and they are designed to degrade once inside the body .PERIOD it disintegrates a few months later ,COMMA what about other structures .PERIOD this is actually an engineered blood vessel .PERIOD you now have your fully seeded scaffold .PERIOD we then take a scaffold that we shape like a bladder ,COMMA we place it back into this oven-like device .PERIOD so bladders are definitely a little bit more complex than the other structures .PERIOD but there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it .PERIOD we exercise these prior to implantation .PERIOD all we are left with is the skeleton .PERIOD if you will of the liver ,COMMA all made up of collagen ,COMMA a material that's in our bodies that will not reject .PERIOD this is still experimental ,COMMA but we are able to actually reproduce the functionality of the liver structure .PERIOD experimentally .PERIOD so another strategy we're following is actually to create wafers that we stack together ,COMMA like an accordion ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA if at all possible ,COMMA we really would like to use smart biomaterials that we can just take off the shelf and regenerate your organs .PERIOD why ?QUESTIONMARK because we'd rather take those cells ,COMMA which already know that those are the cell types .PERIOD you want .PERIOD and we prefer cells that will not reject and will not form tumors .PERIOD and we're working a lot with the stem cells that we published on two years ago ,COMMA stem cells from the amniotic fluid and the

,COMMA d ,COMMA e ,COMMA f .PERIOD entrepreneurs are people -- because we have a lot of them in this room -- ,COMMA who have these ideas .PERIOD and these passions or see these needs in the world ,COMMA and we decide to stand up and do it .PERIOD and as a young kid ,COMMA nobody can say it can't happen because you're too dumb to realize that you couldn't figure it out if we can teach our kids to become entrepreneurial -- .PERIOD the ones that show those traits to be -- like we teach the ones who have science gifts to go on in science .PERIOD what if we saw the ones who had entrepreneurial traits and taught them to be entrepreneurs ?QUESTIONMARK we could actually have all these kids spreading businesses ,COMMA instead of waiting for government handouts .PERIOD and the media says that it's really cool .PERIOD if we could go out and be a model or a singer ,COMMA or a sports hero ,COMMA like luongo crosby ,COMMA our mba programs do not teach kids to be entrepreneurs .PERIOD we didn't fit in the normal work .PERIOD we couldn't work for somebody else because we're too stubborn .PERIOD and we have all these other traits i could go on and on fit into this other system and try to become a student .PERIOD i'm also quoted -- .PERIOD and i told the person who wrote the textbook -- .PERIOD i'm now quoted in that exact same university textbook in every canadian university and college studies .PERIOD i open up chapter eight ,COMMA talking about budgeting ,COMMA and i told the author after they did my interview that i cheated in that same course .PERIOD and my mom came into the room .PERIOD and she said ,COMMA where are you going to get the coat hangers to sell to the dry cleaners ?QUESTIONMARK i'm like ,COMMA but you have two cars ,COMMA and they don't have license plate protectors .PERIOD so i knew there were two cars with two license plates on each .PERIOD but it was obvious to me right ?QUESTIONMARK buy low sell high .PERIOD don't try to sell to the poor kids .PERIOD they don't have cash .PERIOD the rich people do go ,COMMA get some .PERIOD so that's obvious right and making money off that too .PERIOD i built these little pincushions when i was 11 years old in cubs .PERIOD and we made these pin cushions for our moms for mother's day .PERIOD and you'd make these chairs ,COMMA you get the golf balls ,COMMA and you just throw them in your bathing suit trunks .PERIOD and when you're done ,COMMA you've got a couple hundred of them ,COMMA and they could use those for practice balls ,COMMA but it paid the bills .PERIOD i remember being told to walk out in the middle of a street in banff alberta ,COMMA because i'd thrown a penny out in the street .PERIOD and my dad said ,COMMA go pick it up .PERIOD but then we negotiate on what they're going to get paid .PERIOD you breed that kind of stuff .PERIOD each of my kids has two piggy banks ,COMMA the 50 percent that goes in their house account .PERIOD every six months goes to the bank ,COMMA just do that kind of stuff and have fun with it .PERIOD we have all these lessons in front of us ,COMMA but we don't take those opportunities .PERIOD we teach kids to go get a tutor .PERIOD my kids love this stuff .PERIOD it's a video that was done by one of the companies that i mentor .PERIOD they were trying to figure out how to rebuild their universities .PERIOD since education ,COMMA under the soviet union was essentially propaganda ,COMMA serving the purposes of a state ,COMMA ideology ,COMMA they appreciated that it would take wholesale transformations .PERIOD if they were to provide an education worthy of free men and women ,COMMA you may think ,COMMA you know what is going on in that jane austen novel -- that is until your first encounter with postmodern deconstructionism ,COMMA when the astronomical distance between the realities of the academy .PERIOD and the visionary intensity of this challenge were more than enough .PERIOD i can assure you to give one pause ,COMMA what was happening outside higher education ,COMMA made backing off unthinkable .PERIOD and that was only the beginning incredibly this nation with all its material ,COMMA intellectual and spiritual resources seems utterly helpless to reverse the freefall in any of these areas we are playing with fire on a more personal note .PERIOD this betrayal of our principles ,COMMA our decency ,COMMA our hope made it impossible for me to avoid the question .PERIOD what will i say years from ?QUESTIONMARK now ,COMMA when people ask 'where were you' as president of a leading liberal arts college ,COMMA famous for its innovative history ,COMMA there were no excuses ,COMMA the challenge to figure out what it will take to actually do something that makes a significant and sustainable difference .PERIOD even more valuable history provides a laboratory in which we see played out the actual as well as the intended consequences of ideas .PERIOD students in turn continuously ,COMMA move outside the classroom to engage the world directly .PERIOD this is a political education to be sure the center will embody and sustain this new educational commitment .PERIOD what is certain is that the individual talent exhibited in such abundance here ,COMMA needs to turn its attention to that collaborative ,COMMA messy frustrating ,COMMA contentious and impossible world of politics and public policy .PERIOD all right ,COMMA okay .PERIOD so perfect .PERIOD they go to church by which i mean ,COMMA they do lots of things for free for each other .PERIOD now ,COMMA i know you don't believe me really here .PERIOD he's a terrible producer of videos ,COMMA but it's great content .PERIOD so i'm going to give you a little bit of it .PERIOD so here he is beginning .PERIOD this is this fantastic brat pack remix set to lisztomania .PERIOD they decided they wanted to do the same .PERIOD so that's importantly ,COMMA different from the earlier videos we looked at because here remix isn't just about an individual doing something alone in his basement .PERIOD it becomes an act of social creativity ,COMMA indeed ,COMMA mickey mouse himself .PERIOD of course ,COMMA as steamboat willie is a remix of the then very dominant ,COMMA very popular steamboat bill by buster keaton .PERIOD he is the celebration and ideal of exactly this kind of creativity .PERIOD but then the company passes through this dark stage to this democrat .PERIOD okay ,COMMA for a second example ,COMMA think about this cultural hero icon on the left creator of this character .PERIOD look at the site that he built star wars ,COMMA mashups inviting people to come and use their creative energy to produce a new generation of attention towards this extraordinarily important cultural icon .PERIOD so the point is the republicans here recognize that there's a certain need of ownership ,COMMA a respect for ownership .PERIOD the respect we should give the creator .PERIOD the remixer ,COMMA the owner ,COMMA the property owner ,COMMA the copyright owner of this extraordinarily powerful stuff ,COMMA and not a generation of sharecroppers .PERIOD now ,COMMA i think there are lessons we should learn here lessons about openness .PERIOD our lives are sharing activities at least in part .PERIOD that's number one number two :COLON this ecology of sharing needs freedom within which to create and number three ,COMMA we need to respect the creator .PERIOD the creator of these remixes through rights that are directly tied to them these tools that we built enable this sharing in parts through licenses that make it clear and a freedom to create without requiring permission .PERIOD first ,COMMA because the permission has already been granted and a respect for the creator ,COMMA because it builds upon a copyright .PERIOD the creator has licensed freely .PERIOD and it explains the vast right-wing conspiracy that's obviously developed around these licenses as now more than 350 million digital objects are out there licensed freely in this way .PERIOD now ,COMMA if we can learn those values from at least some influences on the right ,COMMA if we can take them and incorporate them ,COMMA maybe we could do a little trade .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA someone on reddit thought ,COMMA oh ,COMMA what a great thing .PERIOD we should all vote this up .PERIOD and that was that the internet loves ,COMMA mister splashy pants .PERIOD they even created an e-card .PERIOD so you could send your friend a dancing splashy .PERIOD there are so many great publishing tools that are available .PERIOD it only takes a few minutes of your time now to actually produce something .PERIOD if you want to succeed ,COMMA you've got to be okay to just lose control .PERIOD well ,COMMA we all know the world wide web has absolutely transformed publishing broadcasting ,COMMA commerce and social connectivity .PERIOD but where did it all come from ?QUESTIONMARK vannevar bush was the us government's chief scientific adviser during the war ,COMMA and the memex would link information ,COMMA one piece of information to a related piece of information and so forth .PERIOD he built a system ,COMMA and we delivered the world's first hypertext system .PERIOD they had a 12-page supplement in the wall street journal the day it launched .PERIOD i thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA interesting ,COMMA but a guy from cern .PERIOD he's not going to do this in 1992 .PERIOD his paper was rejected for the hypertext conference .PERIOD secondly ,COMMA for the first time ,COMMA in the modern era ,COMMA the dominant country in the world -- ,COMMA which i think is what china will become .PERIOD -- will be not from the west ,COMMA and from very ,COMMA very different civilizational roots .PERIOD now ,COMMA i know it's a widespread assumption in the west that as countries modernize .PERIOD they also westernize .PERIOD it will remain in very fundamental respects ,COMMA very different .PERIOD in other words ,COMMA china ,COMMA unlike the western states ,COMMA and most countries in the world is shaped by its sense of civilization ,COMMA its existence as a civilization-state ,COMMA rather than as a nation-state .PERIOD well ,COMMA basically ,COMMA the east was swallowed by the west .PERIOD hence ,COMMA their attitude ,COMMA for example ,COMMA to the uyghurs and to the tibetans .PERIOD this is the chinese view of the state -- very ,COMMA very different to ours know that china believes in the market and the state .PERIOD moreover ,COMMA this is a very old state tradition ,COMMA a very old tradition of statecraft .PERIOD and yet ,COMMA we still insist by and large in thinking that we can understand china by simply drawing on western experience ,COMMA looking at it through western eyes ,COMMA using western concepts .PERIOD but it's not whereas those cultures ,COMMA -- virtually the rest of the world .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA which have been in a far weaker position vis-a-vis the west -- have been ,COMMA thereby forced to understand the west ,COMMA because of the west's presence in those societies because what's happening back to that chart at the beginning ,COMMA the goldman sachs chart ,COMMA europe was not at the final negotiating table .PERIOD well ,COMMA maybe that's true .PERIOD maybe that's an exaggeration .PERIOD but there's another problem ,COMMA which goes along with this -- that europe is increasingly out of touch with the world -- .PERIOD and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future or take this .PERIOD now ,COMMA this is an idea ,COMMA but it's an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of beijing accelerometers on each hand ,COMMA read hand position .PERIOD and he was very impressed .PERIOD he was all tearing up ready to hug me .PERIOD i must have done about 30000 caricatures that evening .PERIOD i came home to hundreds of hate mails ,COMMA hundreds of people telling me how they could have lived another day without seeing this .PERIOD i was also asked to leave the organization a cartoonists' organization in america that for me was my lifeline .PERIOD and all of a sudden ,COMMA my paintings came alive .PERIOD the collaborative effort was fabulous .PERIOD since i mentioned ,COMMA my wife ,COMMA the most important collaboration has been with her .PERIOD netra .PERIOD i must have been 19 and a half then .PERIOD and it was love at first sight .PERIOD i lived in india .PERIOD she lived in america .PERIOD notice one thing we're equal here .PERIOD we had fashion designers installation artists models .PERIOD we had makeup artists ,COMMA jewelry designers ,COMMA all kinds of people working with me to make my wedding an art installation .PERIOD and i had a special installation in tribute to my in-laws .PERIOD i could not live this larger than life person this time .PERIOD i said ,COMMA let's try something different .PERIOD and this was just eight months ago .PERIOD i walk into her room ,COMMA and there was a shy girl ,COMMA and she was bald ,COMMA and she was trying to hide her baldness .PERIOD i whipped out my pen ,COMMA and i started drawing on her head .PERIOD and i drew a crown for her our computers .PERIOD our systems will be as primitive as the apollo's are for today .PERIOD we can develop any part of the body .PERIOD the other major development is going to be in the area of what can happen in genetics .PERIOD this would imply a massive leap ,COMMA in migration ,COMMA an individual for the first time in the history of humanity will have the capacity by 2030 to destroy the planet to wreck everything through the creation .PERIOD for example ,COMMA of a biopathogen ,COMMA more people ,COMMA smaller spaces ,COMMA less stuff .PERIOD for example ,COMMA i want to use zipcar .PERIOD and so from a branding perspective ,COMMA they got a lot right platforms are invitations so creating craigslist or itunes .PERIOD and the iphone developer network ,COMMA there are all these networks -- facebook as well .PERIOD essentially there are all sorts of restaurants in oakland ,COMMA near where i live .PERIOD and one quick example is velib in 2007 came forward in paris with a very bold proposition ,COMMA a very big bike-sharing service .PERIOD we're at the very beginning of something that what we're seeing .PERIOD and the way that mesh companies are coming forward is inviting it's engaging .PERIOD but it's very early .PERIOD you have to make a wish to save the world .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA i can't save the world .PERIOD nobody can i know those guys .PERIOD it was the only one i had at that time .PERIOD they were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves .PERIOD so we decided to take portraits of palestinians and israelis doing the same jobs .PERIOD -- taxi-driver lawyer ,COMMA cooks the experts said ,COMMA no way .PERIOD we said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA let's try and push as far as we can .PERIOD okay .PERIOD for example ,COMMA that's palestine .PERIOD three kids ,COMMA -- .PERIOD that was three students .PERIOD -- were [detained] by the army because they were not carrying their papers .PERIOD we need culture out there .PERIOD you see that enough in the media .PERIOD what i want to show is the incredible life during that time ,COMMA you haven't thought about what you're going to eat tomorrow .PERIOD when you look at kibera now ,COMMA they look back .PERIOD so we could just walk in the street during the next days ,COMMA and the photos would get revealed by themselves .PERIOD so we didn't get caught this time ,COMMA hopefully you'll see the film ,COMMA and you'll understand the scope of the project .PERIOD and what the people felt when they saw those photos ,COMMA because that's a big part of it .PERIOD there's layers behind each photo ,COMMA but tell me advertising for what the people i photograph were proud to participate in the project ,COMMA and to have their photo in the community .PERIOD the importance is what you do with the images .PERIOD the statement ,COMMA it makes where it's pasted .PERIOD this image of three men wearing gas masks was taken in chernobyl originally ,COMMA and i pasted it in southern italy where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground .PERIOD so a subject ,COMMA you're passionate about a person who you want to tell their story ,COMMA or even your own photos .PERIOD -- tell me what you stand for einstein's ,COMMA especially interested in penelope's talk .PERIOD a lot of her research goes on in caves ,COMMA which can get pretty dusty well .PERIOD that's really cool .PERIOD but what einstein's really hoping is that ,COMMA maybe he'll genetically engineer ,COMMA a five-pound peanut .PERIOD that is one big peanut since einstein is a bird .PERIOD she's very interested in things that fly .PERIOD e :COLON [spaceship ,COMMA noise] ,COMMA sw .PERIOD even if it doesn't have a laser .PERIOD e :COLON [squawks] sw .PERIOD yeah .PERIOD it sure can .PERIOD but when einstein needs to relax from her job ,COMMA educating the public ,COMMA she loves to take in the arts ,COMMA or maybe sirena huang would like to learn some arias on her violin .PERIOD and einstein can sing along with some opera .PERIOD e :COLON [operatic ,COMMA squawk] ,COMMA sw ,COMMA very good ,COMMA or maybe stu ,COMMA just needs .PERIOD another backup singer ,COMMA you like to drink water .PERIOD again .PERIOD e :COLON ooooowww .PERIOD e :COLON goodbye .PERIOD and about five years ago ,COMMA we asked what was the most important need for innovation in schooling here in the uk ,COMMA the minister of education down south in london ,COMMA described himself as a big fan .PERIOD they're not like all of you who can sit in rows .PERIOD and hear things said to you for hour after hour ,COMMA i would run into the living room jump up on the couch ,COMMA rip ,COMMA the cushions off ,COMMA throw them on the floor ,COMMA scream at the top of my lungs and run out ,COMMA because i was the incredible hulk .PERIOD and i would like to share my art .PERIOD so moving onward first principles .PERIOD this is very important .PERIOD i tried kickboards hand ,COMMA paddles .PERIOD everything kicking harder doesn't solve the problem ,COMMA because the average swimmer only transfers about three percent of their energy expenditure into forward motion .PERIOD so let's look at some examples .PERIOD this is terry ,COMMA rather .PERIOD he is entering the water at a 45-degree angle with his forearm .PERIOD and then propelling himself by streamlining -- very important below is what most swimmers will find enables them to do what i did ,COMMA which is going from 21 strokes per 20-yard length to 11 strokes in two workouts with no coach .PERIOD no video monitoring in freestyle ,COMMA easiest way to remedy .PERIOD this is to turn with body roll .PERIOD and just to look at your recovery hand as it enters the water .PERIOD then i transferred to a different school sophomore year ,COMMA and i had a choice of other languages .PERIOD most of my friends were taking japanese .PERIOD i couldn't believe i was on the other side of the world .PERIOD and a teacher came up to me and handed me a piece of paper .PERIOD and that's pretty much my response .PERIOD nothing worked until i found this many of the publications in japan limit themselves to these characters to facilitate literacy -- some are required to .PERIOD and now i love languages .PERIOD i was so concerned with her perception of what i was doing that it exploded in my face .PERIOD never to return to the ballroom dancing club .PERIOD everyone burst into laughter .PERIOD i was humiliated .PERIOD so i had a very short deadline for a competition .PERIOD these seemed to be the three areas that i could exploit to compete .PERIOD if i wanted to comptete against people who'd been practicing for 20 to 30 years ,COMMA that photo is of the semi-finals of the buenos aires championships four months later ,COMMA then one month later went to the world championships made it to the semi-final ,COMMA and then set a world record following that two weeks later .PERIOD so he can lift the woman to break her .PERIOD for example ,COMMA there are many different types .PERIOD i have hundreds of hours of footage -- all categorized ,COMMA much like george carlin categorized ,COMMA his comedy .PERIOD so fear is your friend .PERIOD fear is an indicator ,COMMA especially with fears .PERIOD you gained when you were a child .PERIOD and if any of you are interested in that ,COMMA i would love to speak with you .PERIOD but i ask a lot of questions ,COMMA and i would love your advice .PERIOD it's written using wiki software -- ,COMMA which is the type of software .PERIOD he just demonstrated -- .PERIOD so anyone can quickly edit and save .PERIOD and it goes live on the internet immediately .PERIOD so when yochai is talking about new methods of organization ,COMMA he's exactly describing wikipedia .PERIOD and what i'm going to do today is tell you a little bit more about how it really works on the inside .PERIOD and so if you think about what that means ,COMMA it means a lot more than just building a cool website .PERIOD and so that's a big part of why we've chosen the free licensing model ,COMMA because that empowers local entrepreneurs ,COMMA -- or anyone who wants to can take our content and do anything they like with it -- .PERIOD you can copy it ,COMMA redistribute it .PERIOD and you can do it commercially or non-commercially the biggest languages are german japanese french -- .PERIOD all the western european languages are quite big .PERIOD so the big question ,COMMA when you've got this really chaotic organization is why isn't it all rubbish ?QUESTIONMARK why is the website as good as it is ?QUESTIONMARK the actual truth about the specific bush-kerry incident is that the bush-kerry articles were locked less than one percent of the time in 2004 .PERIOD and it wasn't because they were contentious .PERIOD it was just because there was routine vandalism -- ,COMMA which happens sometimes even on stage people -- .PERIOD sometimes even reporters have reported to me that they vandalize wikipedia and were amazed that it was fixed so quickly .PERIOD so the biggest and the most important thing is our neutral point-of-view policy .PERIOD if you engage in that type of behavior ,COMMA you'll be asked to leave the community .PERIOD and then users can set up their own personal .PERIOD watch list so my page is on quite a few volunteers' watch lists because it is sometimes vandalized .PERIOD and that's a really important thing to understand is that the vast majority of the edits that go on on the website are from a very close-knit community of maybe 600 to 1000 people who are in constant communication .PERIOD another thing that we do within the community is we leave everything very open-ended .PERIOD i give this talk sometimes with angela ,COMMA who was just re-elected to the board from the community -- to the board of the foundation ,COMMA with more than twice the votes of the person who didn't make it .PERIOD of course ,COMMA the vote ended up being about 85 to 18 .PERIOD so there was no real danger to our democratic processes .PERIOD it strikes me that much of the textbooks that are used to educate our children are inherently biased have you found wikipedia being used by teachers .PERIOD and how do you see wikipedia changing education ?QUESTIONMARK it builds on the storyline of bloggers versus newspapers .PERIOD i sent it from my harvard email address ,COMMA because i was recently appointed a fellow there .PERIOD and so the wiki books project is an effort to do that in the jungles of guatemala ,COMMA in tikal stands a temple .PERIOD his name was jasaw chan k'awiil .PERIOD he lived into his 80s ,COMMA and he was buried beneath this monument .PERIOD in 720 ad .PERIOD they've never found a society that did not have it .PERIOD it was told by an anonymous kwakiutl indian of southern alaska to a missionary in 1896 .PERIOD and here it is .PERIOD it's below your emotions .PERIOD it comes from a david mamet play .PERIOD and there's two con artists in the play .PERIOD and the woman is conning ,COMMA the man and the man looks at the woman and says ,COMMA oh ,COMMA you're a bad pony .PERIOD i'm not going to bet on you .PERIOD so what have i learned from this experiment that i would like to tell the world too old too young ,COMMA too scruffy ,COMMA too stupid ?QUESTIONMARK and they won't do it .PERIOD and in fact ,COMMA sometimes i feel a little sorry for the chicken on my dinner plate ,COMMA when i think of how intense this brain system is .PERIOD and so i've spent the last three years on this .PERIOD and so there's one thing that makes me pursue my understanding of human nature .PERIOD and this reminds me of it .PERIOD women tend to get intimacy differently than men do ♫ what is the weather in cincinnati ?QUESTIONMARK ♫ ♫ what is the time in tokyo ?QUESTIONMARK ♫ ♫

,COMMA whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the sorts of non-lethal weapons that police have military personnel are being trained for war .PERIOD so they're trained that as soon as things go bad .PERIOD their first response is lethal force .PERIOD and of course ,COMMA being australian i started looking at stuff in australia ,COMMA knowing again ,COMMA from my own experience ,COMMA about various times ,COMMA when non-lethal weapons have been introduced in australia .PERIOD this is something they can use instead of a firearm in those situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone .PERIOD this was something explicitly introduced to be an alternative to firearms .PERIOD but it's being routinely used to deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems .PERIOD now ,COMMA one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of non-lethal weapons -- and people when they're actually saying ,COMMA well ,COMMA hey ,COMMA there might be some problems -- .PERIOD there's a couple of particular problems that get focused on .PERIOD you have to be careful about who you're shooting at .PERIOD they were holding something like 700 people hostage .PERIOD and it's no surprise that people died ,COMMA because you don't know how much of this gas .PERIOD each person is going to inhale what position they're going to fall in when they become unconscious .PERIOD and so on ,COMMA the person who's spraying the oc .PERIOD spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don't get contaminated .PERIOD and so on .PERIOD just in case ,COMMA you think it's only going to happen in the united states .PERIOD it happened in canada as well .PERIOD and a colleague of mine sent me this one from london .PERIOD i looked at it .PERIOD i was really surprised .PERIOD so if you have these problems with police officers with non-lethal weapons ,COMMA what on earth would make ,COMMA you think it's going to be better with military personnel .PERIOD what would these guys have done if they'd had access to tasers or to a manned portable version of the active denial system ,COMMA -- a small heat ray that you can use on people and not worry about it ?QUESTIONMARK and here he'll explain a little bit about what it does .PERIOD and i found this old video with our strengths and our minds and spirit .PERIOD we gather we form ,COMMA and we fashion this particular reel -- .PERIOD it's an industrial video -- .PERIOD but it was shown in drive-in theaters in 1961 -- in the detroit area ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA -- and it preceded alfred hitchcock's psycho .PERIOD and when i sat down next to him ,COMMA he was telling me about a company he formed .PERIOD and he was building some robots for automobile factories to move things around on the factory floor .PERIOD now ,COMMA the other thing that i think is taking off .PERIOD another reason making is taking off today is there's some great new tools out there .PERIOD so they're the brains of maker projects .PERIOD and here's an example of one .PERIOD these guys came up with a kit version for 750 dollars .PERIOD and that means that hobbyists and ordinary folks can get a hold of this and begin playing with 3d printers .PERIOD isn't that cool ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA he did a little bit better than free .PERIOD so we all think we know what glamour is here .PERIOD it is .PERIOD it's glamorous movie stars ,COMMA like marlene ,COMMA dietrich ,COMMA fantastic glamorous pictures of steel ,COMMA mills and paper mills and all kinds of glamorous .PERIOD industrial places you had a glamour .PERIOD there is a process of idealization glorification and dramatization .PERIOD and it's not just the case for people .PERIOD glamour doesn't have to be people .PERIOD it puts you into this special special world .PERIOD she's not looking away from you exactly .PERIOD but you have to mentally imagine her world .PERIOD she's encouraging you to contemplate this higher world to which she belongs ,COMMA where she can be completely tranquil ,COMMA while holding the iron instruments of her death by torture .PERIOD this sort of streamlining styling is not just glamorous because we associate it with movies of that period .PERIOD but because in it's streamlining ,COMMA it transports us from the everyday to conceal all art and make whatever is done or said ,COMMA appear to be without effort .PERIOD and this is one of the critical aspects of glamour .PERIOD but if you look in a catalog ,COMMA -- ,COMMA particularly a catalog of modern beautiful objects for your home -- ,COMMA it looks like this .PERIOD part of the thing is that in rear window .PERIOD the question is ,COMMA is she too glamorous to live in his world ?QUESTIONMARK and the answer is no .PERIOD but of course ,COMMA it's really just a movie .PERIOD so this session's supposed to be about pure pleasure ,COMMA but glamour's ,COMMA really ,COMMA partly about meaning ,COMMA the perfect love life ,COMMA -- symbolized by the perfect necklace .PERIOD the perfect diamond ring .PERIOD this is an interior design firm that is literally called utopia .PERIOD but there's a kind of wonder in the stuff that gets edited away in the cords of life .PERIOD david hockney talks about how the appreciation of this very glamorous .PERIOD painting is heightened .PERIOD if you think about the fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash ,COMMA which only took a fraction of a second to happen .PERIOD but i also knew how hard they worked all week .PERIOD but as a scientist ,COMMA i'm interested in a different problem of other minds .PERIOD and that is the one i'm going to introduce to you today .PERIOD and then finally ,COMMA to show that some of the differences between people in how we judge others can be explained by differences in this brain system ,COMMA child ,COMMA what rs pirates really like cheese sandwiches .PERIOD this pirate is called joshua .PERIOD now ,COMMA i'm going to show you a three-year-old who got the same puzzle .PERIOD so the three-year-old does two things differently .PERIOD and second ,COMMA when he sees ivan taking the sandwich ,COMMA where he left his ,COMMA where we would say ,COMMA he's taking that one because he thinks it's his .PERIOD the three-year-old comes up with another explanation .PERIOD he's not taking his own sandwich ,COMMA because he doesn't want it because now it's dirty on the ground .PERIOD so that's why he's taking the other sandwich .PERIOD and we can see the continuation of this process of learning to think about other people's thoughts by upping the ante and asking children now ,COMMA not for an action prediction .PERIOD but for a moral judgment ,COMMA remember ,COMMA the five-year-old completely understood why ivan took joshua's sandwich was ivan being mean and naughty for taking joshua's sandwich ?QUESTIONMARK he says ,COMMA the wind should get in trouble for switching the sandwiches .PERIOD and so what we wanted to know was could differences among adults in how they think about other people's thoughts ,COMMA be explained in terms of differences in this brain region ,COMMA and her friend drinks ,COMMA the coffee and is fine .PERIOD and what you can see is on the left ,COMMA when there was very little activity in this brain region ,COMMA people paid little attention to her innocent belief and said ,COMMA she deserved a lot of blame for the accident .PERIOD first ,COMMA i'm going to show you that .PERIOD this is a magnetic pulse .PERIOD i'm going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine ,COMMA but in the case of a failed attempt to harm ,COMMA where grace thought that it was poison ,COMMA although it was really sugar people now say ,COMMA it was more okay ,COMMA she deserves less blame for putting the powder in the coffee .PERIOD so it's not a surreptitious technology .PERIOD so i've got one last question .PERIOD there is this thing called the hard problem of consciousness that puzzles a lot of people .PERIOD why me was composed of stories of cravings of strivings of desires of the future me only existed in the trying babies actually don't come out of your mouth .PERIOD i would drive it and demand things from it .PERIOD i didn't heed it .PERIOD no ,COMMA i organized it ,COMMA and i directed it .PERIOD i took more than my body had to offer cancer exploded the wall of my disconnection .PERIOD now ,COMMA i am swimming in it .PERIOD so we brought her home ,COMMA and i prayed that the oil wouldn't wash up on her beach before she died .PERIOD and i said ,COMMA but what's the water part ?QUESTIONMARK it was my whole self melting into michaela's lap .PERIOD it was finding my place and the huge responsibility that comes with connection .PERIOD it was energy love and joy .PERIOD it was all these things because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down ,COMMA but they want to know how to slow down really quickly .PERIOD so so i was in new york recently ,COMMA and i walked past a gym that had an advertisement in the window for a new course ,COMMA a new evening course ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a burnout ,COMMA or eventually ,COMMA the body says ,COMMA i can't take it anymore and throws in the towel .PERIOD am i really in such a hurry that i'm prepared to fob off my son ,COMMA with a sound byte at the end of the day ?QUESTIONMARK i just thought ,COMMA and i thought ,COMMA long and hard .PERIOD and by the time i got off that plane ,COMMA i'd decided i wanted to do something about it .PERIOD time is scarce .PERIOD so what do we do ?QUESTIONMARK and i guess that the question is ,COMMA is it possible to break free from that mindset ?QUESTIONMARK and in this kind of cauldron of moments and places and acts of deceleration lie ?QUESTIONMARK what a lot of people now refer to as the international slow movement ?QUESTIONMARK you know ,COMMA you tap into that -- ,COMMA those deeper sort of psychological ,COMMA emotional ,COMMA spiritual currents ,COMMA and you get a better orgasm with the buildup .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA you heard that i got a speeding ticket while i was researching my book on the benefits of slowness ,COMMA and that's true ,COMMA but that's not all of it .PERIOD i think there's a kind of metaphysical dimension -- that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off from the bigger deeper questions .PERIOD we fill our head with distraction with busyness ,COMMA so that we don't have to ask ,COMMA am i well ,COMMA am i happy ?QUESTIONMARK are my children growing up ?QUESTIONMARK right ?QUESTIONMARK it's become my reward at the end of the day ,COMMA something i really cherish .PERIOD i was downstairs by the front door ,COMMA and i was waiting for a taxi .PERIOD and my son came down the stairs ,COMMA and he'd made a card for me ,COMMA and he was carrying it .PERIOD so what i'd like to talk about is something that was very dear to kahn's heart ,COMMA which is ,COMMA how do we discover ?QUESTIONMARK what is really particular about a project .PERIOD this used to be an island ,COMMA -- ,COMMA ackerman island -- .PERIOD and we filled in the channel during the depression to create jobs .PERIOD and here's the building as it opened with a channel ,COMMA overlooking downtown ,COMMA and as seen from downtown ,COMMA every piece of the building works .PERIOD i was very moved by what i saw today .PERIOD let's get back to the town and walk to the site .PERIOD and as things are a little easier in india .PERIOD the site was purchased within a week ,COMMA and we were working and the structures rise from the sand ,COMMA cliffs -- .PERIOD they're built in concrete and sandstones .PERIOD the roofs are stainless steel -- .PERIOD they are facing south and reflecting light towards the temple itself ,COMMA pedestrians crisscross from one side to the other back to yad vashem .PERIOD three years ago ,COMMA after all ,COMMA this episode began ,COMMA yad vashem decided to rebuild completely the historic museum .PERIOD because now washington was built -- ,COMMA the holocaust museum in washington -- .PERIOD and that museum is so much more comprehensive in terms of information .PERIOD they said ,COMMA let's rebuild the museum .PERIOD and here studying in three dimensions ,COMMA how to give some kind again of order a structure ,COMMA not something you feel you could just change because you stop the design of that particular process .PERIOD i'd like to conclude by relating all of what i've said to the term beauty .PERIOD we call a natural object ,COMMA beautiful ,COMMA because we see that its form expresses fitness ,COMMA the perfect fulfillment of function .PERIOD nevertheless ,COMMA beauty as the kind of fit something that tells us that all the forces that have to do with our natural environment ,COMMA have been fulfilled -- and our human environment -- for that .PERIOD he who seeks truth shall find beauty .PERIOD he who seeks beauty shall find vanity .PERIOD he who considers himself the servant of his fellow beings shall find the joy of self-expression .PERIOD he who seeks self-expression shall fall into the pit of arrogance .PERIOD my name is kailash .PERIOD and i like to enrich lives through technicolored glass ,COMMA a rising tide lifts all boats .PERIOD it felt like it was really important .PERIOD i just really wanted to acknowledge you .PERIOD it is really a sacred space .PERIOD see these all lie right inside of this general emotional palette that we were painting the only way that i would say it was a mistake is in that .PERIOD we didn't react to it .PERIOD it was an opportunity that was missed .PERIOD so it's just a season ,COMMA and there are two seasons in most of south asia ,COMMA high pressure builds over india ,COMMA a few kilometers ,COMMA maybe is quite typical .PERIOD and this is called the globe skimmer or wandering glider ,COMMA but it really hasn't been studied very much .PERIOD it's a rather mediocre ,COMMA looking dragonfly .PERIOD if you're going to study dragonflies ,COMMA you want to study those really bright beautiful ones like that .PERIOD red one ,COMMA or the really rare ones ,COMMA the endemic endangered ones ,COMMA and they were there for some time .PERIOD and then they were gone .PERIOD and i didn't think anything more of it until the following year ,COMMA when it happened again .PERIOD and then the year after that ,COMMA and then the year after that ,COMMA and on top of the coral reefs are sand banks .PERIOD those of you who are indian or spent your childhood here .PERIOD let me have a show of hands who of you -- ,COMMA not yet ,COMMA not yet .PERIOD so are these things :COLON how are these things getting here ?QUESTIONMARK it stretches about 500 miles ?QUESTIONMARK of course it's india here .PERIOD when do you see the dragonflies appear ?QUESTIONMARK and then the southernmost maldives .PERIOD so i started a very rigorous scientific process .PERIOD it doesn't make sense .PERIOD there is nothing for them in maldives ,COMMA and we're starting in june .PERIOD so this is the monsoon rain .PERIOD nothing for these dragonflies .PERIOD there is no more seasonal rain .PERIOD they're looking for somewhere to breed .PERIOD if it rains here ,COMMA they'll breed they'll hatch out in six weeks .PERIOD by that time ,COMMA the seasonal rains have moved on .PERIOD it's not there it's down here .PERIOD they'll fly down here .PERIOD and the clever thing is ,COMMA the wind is always converging to where the rain is .PERIOD so the little fellow that hatches out here he gets up into the air .PERIOD he is automatically carried to where the rain is falling .PERIOD so in four generations ,COMMA one ,COMMA two ,COMMA three ,COMMA four and then back a complete circuit of the indian ocean .PERIOD there is more to the story ,COMMA which is an area along the amur river ,COMMA which is up here .PERIOD he's an engineer half as much money was spent on this norden bombsight ,COMMA as was spent on the most famous military-industrial project of the modern era .PERIOD it allowed you to bomb ,COMMA only those things that you absolutely needed and wanted to bomb .PERIOD and it's carried in a box with a canvas shroud over it .PERIOD it's never allowed to be photographed there are clouds ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK the leuna chemical plant .PERIOD after one of the most extensive bombings in the history of the war was up and running within weeks .PERIOD so i would like to invite you also for a while to the himalayas themselves ,COMMA and to show the place where meditators like me ,COMMA who began with being a molecular biologist in pasteur institute and found their way to the mountains .PERIOD i just wrote an essay on happiness .PERIOD and there was a controversy .PERIOD as pascal said ,COMMA even the one who hangs himself somehow is looking for cessation of suffering -- .PERIOD he finds no other way ,COMMA although we want to avoid suffering .PERIOD it seems we are running somewhat towards it .PERIOD and that can also come from some kind of confusions .PERIOD it is something that -- changes of nature .PERIOD it is a deep sense of serenity and fulfillment ,COMMA a state that actually pervades and underlies all emotional states and all the joys and sorrows that can come one's way .PERIOD can we have this kind of well-being while being sad in a way ?QUESTIONMARK why not ?QUESTIONMARK but there's also wicked joy .PERIOD you can rejoice in someone's suffering .PERIOD we know by experience that we can be what we call a little paradise .PERIOD and yet be completely unhappy within the experience that translates everything is within the mind .PERIOD we have to know from ourselves .PERIOD there are certain states of mind that are conducive to this flourishing to this well-being .PERIOD what the greeks called eudaimonia flourishing just the mere fact of doing that fills such a sense of adequation with our deep nature for that .PERIOD we have to ask ,COMMA what is nature of mind ?QUESTIONMARK and if we look from the experiential point of view ,COMMA there is a primary quality of consciousness .PERIOD that's just the mere fact to be cognitive to be aware .PERIOD usually ,COMMA when we feel annoyed hatred or upset with someone or obsessed with something .PERIOD the mind goes again and again to that object .PERIOD but we think we could sit on the cloud -- .PERIOD but if you go there ,COMMA it's just mist .PERIOD mind transformation ,COMMA -- that is the very meaning of meditation .PERIOD so that's what those great meditators have been doing .PERIOD if you are happy about something ,COMMA you'll go more to the left side here .PERIOD the -05 is the full standard deviation of a meditator who meditated on compassion .PERIOD so i've no time to go into all the different scientific results ,COMMA some meditators without trying to stop it ,COMMA but simply by being completely open thinking that that bang is just going to be just a small event like a shooting star .PERIOD they are able not to move at all .PERIOD so the whole point of that is not sort of to make like a circus thing of showing exceptional beings who can jump or whatever we are ready to spend 15 years ,COMMA achieving education .PERIOD i'm not going to show you a presentation .PERIOD i'm going to talk to you .PERIOD the thing that was always striking to me was that we as people could have so many really amazing ideas about things we'd like to do ,COMMA but are so often ,COMMA unable in the real world to actually do those things -- to actually cobble together the materials and go through the actual execution phase of building something that you imagine from a design perspective .PERIOD it's going to be different than here to give you an idea of scale .PERIOD second life is about 20000 cpus at this point .PERIOD and let me justify that with two statements .PERIOD and i think that's something that people have talked about for 20 years -- .PERIOD you know that 3d that lifelike environments are really important in some magical way to us .PERIOD second life originally had 16 simulators it now has 20000 .PERIOD and we had -- .PERIOD we zoned it .PERIOD you know ,COMMA we put a nightclub .PERIOD we put a disco where you could dance .PERIOD and then we had a place where you could fight with guns ,COMMA if you wanted to .PERIOD and we had another place that was like a boardwalk kind of a coney island .PERIOD and so the existence of an economy is critical .PERIOD the question is ,COMMA there appears to be a lack of cultural fine-tuning in second life ,COMMA and so the multicultural nature and the sort of cultural melting pot that's happening inside .PERIOD second .PERIOD life is quite -- .PERIOD i think quite remarkable relative to what in real human terms in the real world we've ever been able to achieve other questions ,COMMA right here .PERIOD what's your demographic in terms of psychographic -- ?QUESTIONMARK oh men and women men and women are almost equally matched in second life .PERIOD so about 45 percent of the people online right now on second life are women in terms of psychographic .PERIOD you know ,COMMA the people in second life are remarkably dissimilar relative to what you might think when you go in and talk to them and meet them .PERIOD and i would ,COMMA you know ,COMMA challenge you to just do this and find out if you count ?QUESTIONMARK yeah ,COMMA cities .PERIOD so -- .PERIOD but i did -- and i didn't do -- .PERIOD i think i didn't do as well in school as i could have ,COMMA i think you're right .PERIOD yeah .PERIOD so let me restate that .PERIOD so you're saying that in the pamphlet ,COMMA there's a statement that we may come to prefer our digital selves to our real ones ,COMMA -- ,COMMA our more malleable ,COMMA or manageable digital identities to our real identities -- ,COMMA and that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA much of human life and human experience may move into the digital realm .PERIOD that's a frightening change ,COMMA frightening disruption .PERIOD i guess and you're asking ,COMMA what do i think about that ?QUESTIONMARK how do i -- jh :COLON what's your response to the people who would say that's horrifying (audience ,COMMA if someone would say to you ,COMMA i find that disturbing ,COMMA what would be your response) pr ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA i'd say a couple of things now ,COMMA the problem of human diversity ,COMMA like all big scientific questions -- .PERIOD how do you explain something like that ?QUESTIONMARK -- can be broken down into sub-questions .PERIOD what we're asking about ,COMMA though ,COMMA is human ancestry ,COMMA digging things up out of the ground and largely on the basis of morphology -- ,COMMA the way things are shaped often skull shape -- saying ,COMMA this looks a little bit more like us than that .PERIOD so this must be my ancestor .PERIOD you think you've got a tough job .PERIOD now ,COMMA a quick primer on dna ,COMMA mitochondrial dna ,COMMA tracing a purely maternal line of descent ,COMMA turn them on their sides ,COMMA combine them so that they look like a tree with the root at the bottom .PERIOD and the branches going up was it millions of years ago ,COMMA which we might suspect by looking at all this incredible variation around the world .PERIOD why was it that we seem to have come out of africa ?QUESTIONMARK so recently ,COMMA what was going on to the world's weather around 60000 years ago ?QUESTIONMARK the reason for that is that ice actually sucks moisture out of the atmosphere .PERIOD now ,COMMA at the risk of offending ,COMMA any paleoanthropologists or physical anthropologists in the audience .PERIOD basically ,COMMA there's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups .PERIOD well ,COMMA you want the ultimate african success story .PERIOD look in the mirror .PERIOD you're it .PERIOD the reason you're alive today is because of those changes in our brains that took place in africa ,COMMA -- probably somewhere in the region where we're sitting right now around 60 70 thousand years ago ,COMMA -- allowing us ,COMMA not only to survive in africa ,COMMA but to expand out of africa ,COMMA these would have been savannah hunters entering europe around 35000 years ago .PERIOD and finally ,COMMA a small group migrating up through the worst weather imaginable siberia inside the arctic circle ,COMMA during the last ice ,COMMA age -- temperature was at -70 -80 ,COMMA even -100 ,COMMA perhaps -- migrating into the americas .PERIOD ultimately ,COMMA reaching that final frontier .PERIOD the changes that allowed us to do that .PERIOD the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us ,COMMA allowing us to create novel cultures ,COMMA allowing us to develop the diversity that we see on a whirlwind trip ,COMMA like the one i've just been on the field research that we're doing around the world with indigenous peoples ,COMMA the human genome project ,COMMA or a mars rover mission .PERIOD in this case ,COMMA you actually can .PERIOD and you'll now see the yolk and the white have separated .PERIOD and we all know in our heart of hearts that this is not the way the universe works .PERIOD and yet look around us .PERIOD now ,COMMA we move forward 380000 years ,COMMA but that's not completely true .PERIOD recent studies by satellites ,COMMA such as the wmap satellite have shown that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA there are just tiny differences in that background .PERIOD we have our first stars .PERIOD so we've crossed a fourth threshold of complexity .PERIOD so it copies itself and scatters the templates through the ocean .PERIOD and that's why as a species we're so creative and so powerful .PERIOD and that's why we have a history .PERIOD and then from about 500 years ago ,COMMA humans began to link up globally through shipping through trains through telegraph through the internet .PERIOD until now we seem to form a single global brain of almost seven billion individuals .PERIOD we've been on a journey ,COMMA a return journey of 137 billion years ,COMMA and it's a story in which humans play an astonishing and creative role ,COMMA collective learning is a very ,COMMA very powerful force .PERIOD and it's not clear that we humans are in charge of it .PERIOD the program in a sense is an example of behavioral finance on steroids ,COMMA -- how we could really use behavioral finance .PERIOD how many of you have iphones ?QUESTIONMARK and that's what i really want to focus on today .PERIOD and what i'm going to talk about today is save more tomorrow .PERIOD first thing to notice is half of them do not even have access to a 401 plan ,COMMA and they get overwhelmed and the just don't join suppose .PERIOD we had another wonderful ted event next week ,COMMA the same people that imagined themselves eating the bananas ended up eating chocolates .PERIOD a week later .PERIOD self-control is not a problem in the future .PERIOD nobody checks boxes .PERIOD we're going to talk about what happens if people are overwhelmed and scared to make their 401 choices .PERIOD they're really mad .PERIOD we first implemented it .PERIOD richard thaler and i back in 1998 .PERIOD we invited them to save three percentage points more every time they get a pay .PERIOD raise .PERIOD we're seeing here ,COMMA a three and a half-year period .PERIOD four pay raises people who were struggling to save were saving three percent of their paycheck .PERIOD three and a half years later ,COMMA saving almost four times as much almost 14 percent .PERIOD it's been part of the pension protection act .PERIOD the average household spends $4000 a year on lottery tickets ,COMMA one ,COMMA two ,COMMA three ,COMMA four

just make me care .PERIOD and so if i were going to give you the ending of this story ,COMMA it would go something like this .PERIOD and that's what ultimately led me to speaking to you here at ted

horrible choices with them .PERIOD but a major threshold is passed when you mature enough to acknowledge ,COMMA what drives you and to take the wheel and steer it .PERIOD and that's why change is

commodities that fundamentally pose the biggest threats to these places ,COMMA because of deforestation ,COMMA soil loss ,COMMA water use pesticide use over-fishing .PERIOD etc .PERIOD are we going to work with 15 billion producers ,COMMA if we work with those ,COMMA if we change those companies and the way they do business ,COMMA then the rest will happen automatically .PERIOD because if these companies demand sustainable products ,COMMA they'll pull 40 to 50 percent of production by companies asking for this ,COMMA we can leverage production so much faster than by waiting for consumers to do it .PERIOD after 40 years ,COMMA the global organic movement has achieved 07 of one percent of global food .PERIOD we can't wait that long .PERIOD we need change that's going to accelerate .PERIOD so it's the demand that brings them to the table .PERIOD so we're pulling out all the stops .PERIOD they're doing it with ibm and the usda ,COMMA and they're putting it in the public domain ,COMMA

sasha .PERIOD that's why all of this that you're going through -- ,COMMA the ups and the downs ,COMMA the teachers that you love and the teachers that you don't -- ,COMMA why it's so important and having done .PERIOD so these women moved many obstacles .PERIOD i liked being smart .PERIOD i liked being on time .PERIOD i liked getting my work done history proves that it doesn't matter whether you come from a council estate or a country estate in the white house .PERIOD there's the desk that he sits at -- .PERIOD it's called the resolute desk .PERIOD she is a world-class .PERIOD soprano singer who studied in rochester new york for me .PERIOD the human voice is the vessel on which all emotions travel -- ,COMMA except perhaps jealousy ,COMMA when you're totally in the moment ,COMMA when i'm totally in the moment ,COMMA the vessel of expression is open ,COMMA the emotions can flow from me to you and back .PERIOD it's called aria .PERIOD for example ,COMMA there are different colors ,COMMA and each color gets a different type of singing -- pop country and western opera ,COMMA jazz -- .PERIOD and you just have to be consistent with that color .PERIOD they had one great limitation and one great freedom as they tried to conceive of a global network .PERIOD so unusual ,COMMA in fact that it was said that it's not clear the internet could work .PERIOD now ,COMMA of course ,COMMA in a mosh pit ,COMMA it's hard to specify a destination .PERIOD this is a system that relies on kindness and trust ,COMMA which also makes it very delicate and vulnerable .PERIOD so ,COMMA for example ,COMMA last year ,COMMA the government of pakistan asked its internet service providers there to prevent citizens of pakistan from seeing youtube .PERIOD and here is the message where one of them says looks like we've got a live one .PERIOD we have a hijacking of youtube .PERIOD and today ,COMMA wikipedia is so ubiquitous that you can now find it .PERIOD on chinese restaurant menus .PERIOD i am not making this up .PERIOD and there are a bunch of people who on a sunny day would rather be inside .PERIOD and monitoring this ,COMMA the administrator's notice board itself ,COMMA a wiki page that anyone can edit .PERIOD there are spambots crawling it ,COMMA trying to turn every article into an ad for a rolex .PERIOD watch .PERIOD it's something they feel impelled to do because they care about it .PERIOD here is just a snapshot of some of them .PERIOD if you do ,COMMA it will be removed .PERIOD immediately removed by people who may have disagreed with the original decision ,COMMA but respect the outcome and work to make it stay because they believe in something bigger than their own opinion .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA this is a 2005 business week cover .PERIOD yeah ,COMMA i know number four .PERIOD it's like ,COMMA can you imagine coming home to that ?QUESTIONMARK cat everyday ,COMMA this one says ,COMMA bucolic meadow with split-rail fence ,COMMA and then have technology that the person taking the photo will know later this person requested to be contacted before .PERIOD this goes anywhere big ,COMMA if you don't mind .PERIOD and that person taking the photo can make a decision about how and whether to respect it .PERIOD and we now have means that we can build like this system ,COMMA so that people can report the filtering as they encounter it .PERIOD why there is the craigslist rideshare board ,COMMA if it were called the craigslist hitchhiking board ,COMMA tumbleweeds would be blowing through it ,COMMA but it's the rideshare board ,COMMA and it's basically the same thing .PERIOD it's a bee that yes flies .PERIOD we all live in the same planet ,COMMA but there's still a great deal of poverty in the world and by and large .PERIOD this has failed aid actually did the opposite .PERIOD so 12 years ago ,COMMA i was trying to be an investment banker in new york .PERIOD and it reminded me of a day in 1971 .PERIOD and after all poor countries ,COMMA like rich countries ,COMMA one thing we've got equal is their days are the same length 24 hours .PERIOD the question was ,COMMA how much did it cost to install a new telephone in bangladesh ?QUESTIONMARK it turns out 2000 dollars .PERIOD and of course ,COMMA if the cost of installing a telephone is going down because there's a digital revolution going on ,COMMA then it would be even more dramatic ,COMMA but in any event ,COMMA it's connectivity .PERIOD that leads to dependability .PERIOD there were a lot of reasons .PERIOD people told me why we don't have enough telephones .PERIOD the work pays them a salary ,COMMA the salary allows them to pay for the car .PERIOD over time .PERIOD the car pays for itself .PERIOD see you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing .PERIOD for instance ,COMMA the internet was booming in the us ,COMMA and she sells the milk to the villagers and pays off the loan .PERIOD and these phones are generating about 100 million dollars for the company .PERIOD it's just an experiment .PERIOD i was a guest student during one month of a public .PERIOD health course they read the textbook twice or three times or four times .PERIOD and they were the first to twitter transatlantically .PERIOD those are nice words ,COMMA but i got sort of curious of what he meant with liberty and liberty for whom ,COMMA but really ,COMMA really natural sovereignty was good for japan .PERIOD in 1947 ,COMMA india finally gained its independence .PERIOD you can see that the health started to improve in '92 india follows with a market reform ,COMMA and they go quite closely together .PERIOD and you can see that the similarity with india and china in many ways are greater than the differences with them .PERIOD kerala is flying on top .PERIOD there matching united states in health ,COMMA but not in economy .PERIOD we have an enormous disparity in the world .PERIOD you see china under foreign domination ,COMMA actually lowered their income and came down to the indian level here .PERIOD japan ,COMMA did it like this until full catch up ?QUESTIONMARK and then they follow with the other high-income economies .PERIOD can be worse ,COMMA can be better .PERIOD but more recently ,COMMA i've been turning my attention to the universe on the largest scale by invisible .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA it doesn't absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum when those measurements are made .PERIOD instead ,COMMA what we find is that the speed is basically constant as a function of distance .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA this galaxy and every other galaxy appears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible ,COMMA dark matter .PERIOD it would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly .PERIOD now ,COMMA how do we deduce where the galaxy is ?QUESTIONMARK where will this observer see the galaxy ?QUESTIONMARK so there's a whole ray of light ,COMMA -- rays of light on a cone -- that will all be bent by that cluster and make it into the observer's eye .PERIOD so actually at home ,COMMA whenever we break a wineglass ,COMMA i save the bottom .PERIOD take it over to the machine shop .PERIOD we shave it off .PERIOD and i have a little gravitational lens ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK and we see these gravitational lensing effects .PERIOD these distortions that say that again ,COMMA clusters are embedded in dark matter .PERIOD they're moving away from each other ,COMMA because space itself is getting bigger .PERIOD ok .PERIOD so in the last century ,COMMA ok ,COMMA people debated about whether this expansion of space would continue forever ,COMMA whether it would slow down ,COMMA you know ,COMMA will be slowing down ,COMMA but continue forever .PERIOD slow down and stop asymptotically stop or slow down ,COMMA stop and then reverse .PERIOD so it starts to contract again ,COMMA by how much less is it expanding today ,COMMA compared to say a couple of billion years ago .PERIOD so we need something to be able to explain that .PERIOD but we don't know if either of those are actually the dark matter candidate ,COMMA ok ,COMMA they haven't seen anything ,COMMA ok ,COMMA but it puts limits on what the mass and the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are there's going to be a satellite telescope launched later this year ,COMMA and it will look towards the middle of the galaxy to see if we can see ,COMMA dark matter ,COMMA particles ,COMMA annihilating and producing gamma rays that could be detected with this .PERIOD now ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA there is a lot of new physics whose signature could be missing energy .PERIOD so it will be hard to tell the difference .PERIOD and finally for future endeavors .PERIOD there are telescopes being designed specifically to address the questions of dark matter and dark energy ,COMMA -- ground-based telescopes .PERIOD and there are three space-based telescopes that are in competition ,COMMA right now to be launched to investigate dark matter and dark energy .PERIOD and over the course of half an hour ,COMMA not one syringe was filmed being unwrapped .PERIOD they started with two ,COMMA and they ended with two in china .PERIOD recycling is a major issue ,COMMA and they use them in the breaks for water pistols .PERIOD and they are having great fun ,COMMA and they squirt the water into their mouths .PERIOD you load it up in the normal way .PERIOD this is made on existing equipment in 14 factories that we license .PERIOD imagine that orchestration .PERIOD this happens every year and one time he came up to me -- .PERIOD he was about seven or eight years old -- .PERIOD he came up to me ,COMMA and there was a wasp's nest that i had let grow in my yard right outside my door ,COMMA and like knock like a woodpecker on my door ,COMMA until i opened it up .PERIOD and i told him ,COMMA you know ,COMMA cody ,COMMA the wasps actually made that they're the people who make the bullet train .PERIOD and those bumps act like a magnet for water ,COMMA and the fog comes in ,COMMA and it builds up on the tips .PERIOD now ,COMMA it's reversing that equation and actually sequestering half a ton of co2 .PERIOD thanks to the recipe from the coral .PERIOD they actually export water molecules through and those scalloped edges play with flow in such a way that is reduces drag by 32 percent .PERIOD the question is -- .PERIOD biomimicry is an incredibly powerful way to innovate .PERIOD and we are in a long long line of organisms to come to this planet and ask ourselves ,COMMA how can we live here gracefully over the long haul ?QUESTIONMARK now in order to do this ,COMMA the design challenge of our century ?QUESTIONMARK i think we need a way to remind ourselves of those geniuses ,COMMA and to somehow meet them again .PERIOD and we're working with eol encyclopedia of life .PERIOD ed wilson's :COLON ted wish .PERIOD and this is a pretty well-educated .PERIOD audience :COLON so i imagine you all know something about aids .PERIOD if you know something more .PERIOD you probably know that uganda to date is the only country in sub-saharan africa that has had success in combating the epidemic .PERIOD but i'm going to use tools and ideas that are familiar to economists to think about a problem .PERIOD that's more traditionally ,COMMA part of public health and epidemiology .PERIOD we see almost no change in sexual behavior .PERIOD aids is the same kind of thing .PERIOD it's costly to avoid aids .PERIOD and the way that i'm going to do that is i'm going to look across areas with different levels of malaria .PERIOD and so people who live in areas with a lot of malaria are going to have lower life expectancy than people who live in areas with limited malaria ,COMMA even if you only cared about aids in africa ,COMMA it might still be a good idea to invest in malaria ,COMMA in combating ,COMMA poor indoor air quality in improving maternal mortality rates .PERIOD if people have no incentive to avoid aids on their own ,COMMA even if they know everything about the disease ,COMMA they still may not change their behavior .PERIOD we know they had this campaign .PERIOD that's how we learn about what works .PERIOD so this is another way to see this .PERIOD so i am going to talk about exports and prices ,COMMA but openness and inter-connectedness .PERIOD it comes with a cost when we think about disease .PERIOD i don't think this should be a surprise areas with a lot of economic activity -- with a lot of roads ,COMMA with a lot of urbanization ,COMMA -- ,COMMA those areas have higher prevalence than others .PERIOD and what's really ,COMMA really great about being here is ,COMMA i'm sure that the questions that you guys have are very ,COMMA very different than the questions that i think up myself .PERIOD it's great being here at ted .PERIOD their relationship is a love story that feeds the earth .PERIOD it reminds us that we are a part of nature ,COMMA and we're not separate from it .PERIOD well ,COMMA their answer was ,COMMA it's all about risk and reward and chip taylor ,COMMA our monarch butterfly expert .PERIOD he replied ,COMMA nothing lasts forever .PERIOD and that blew my mind .PERIOD we were four girls and no boys .PERIOD i don't know if he really meant [that] .PERIOD but it happened out of 100 .PERIOD 90 are your creation .PERIOD this is about tough policing ,COMMA equal policing .PERIOD i now went to a prison assignment as a police officer .PERIOD here .PERIOD i got a prison assignment ,COMMA obviously it was .PERIOD and then how did i deal with them ?QUESTIONMARK the first day ?QUESTIONMARK when i went in ,COMMA i didn't know how to look at them .PERIOD i said ,COMMA do you pray ?QUESTIONMARK do you want to pray ?QUESTIONMARK i think that's the bigger change .PERIOD teachers were prisoners .PERIOD teachers were volunteers .PERIOD you want to know more about this go and see this film doing time doing vipassana .PERIOD let me wrap it up .PERIOD but the best part is ,COMMA the message that the yahoo help desk got about 20 minutes later ,COMMA captcha project is something that we did here at carnegie melllon over 10 years ago ,COMMA and it's been used everywhere .PERIOD so then i started feeling bad .PERIOD so can we get you to do useful work for those 10 seconds ?QUESTIONMARK so you start with a book ,COMMA and then you scan it ,COMMA for example ,COMMA for things that were written more than 50 years ago .PERIOD the computer cannot recognize about 30 percent of the words johnedwardscom .PERIOD so we keep on insulting people left and right everyday .PERIOD there are tens of thousands of these .PERIOD some of them are very cute .PERIOD and it is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda .PERIOD it hasn't yet been launched .PERIOD it's called duolingo .PERIOD it started with me posing a question to my graduate student ,COMMA severin hacker .PERIOD actually it was a forum post .PERIOD remember ,COMMA it's a question about javascript .PERIOD okay ?QUESTIONMARK so computer translation not yet .PERIOD good enough .PERIOD we could pay professional language translators to translate the whole web .PERIOD we could do that if we wanted to translate the other 80 percent into spanish ,COMMA it would cost at least 50 million dollars -- .PERIOD and this is at even the most exploited outsourcing country out there .PERIOD so it would be very expensive .PERIOD for example ,COMMA in the united states alone ,COMMA there are over five million people who have paid over $500 for software to learn a new language .PERIOD there's of course ,COMMA a lot of very simple sentences on the web .PERIOD since all the projects that my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users .PERIOD we're hopeful that we'll be able to translate extremely fast with this project .PERIOD so here's the site ,COMMA but then ,COMMA by the end of the decade ,COMMA the country had fallen back into political instability and mismanagement .PERIOD we the children had gathered at a friend's house .PERIOD i wanted to document on film ,COMMA the 2008 presidential elections .PERIOD and there i started by searching for the footprints in my childhood ,COMMA the polling stations opened to the voters at 700 am but voters ,COMMA eager to take their own political fate into their hands ,COMMA were starting to line up at 400 am in the morning .PERIOD they were chanting .PERIOD we want peace .PERIOD now ,COMMA the uphill battle for ghana and for africa is not over .PERIOD but i have proof that the other side of democracy exists and that we must not take it for granted that -- .PERIOD you know ,COMMA i was born thinking about things that way .PERIOD and i had always been like a little scientist guy and people in the 17th century .PERIOD they didn't really understand the same way we do about .PERIOD you know ,COMMA this stuff is a bunch of different kinds of molecules ,COMMA and we breathe it in for a purpose ,COMMA and all that and boyle said ,COMMA bullshit .PERIOD and so charles said ,COMMA i'm going to put up the money .PERIOD give you guys a building come here ,COMMA and you can meet in the building ,COMMA but just don't talk about religion in there .PERIOD but experimental science had been tied up with all those things kary mullis .PERIOD they might have done it for the teddy bear .PERIOD yeah ,COMMA i thought that anybody with any brains will do it that way .PERIOD i was thinking about making my own little rockets .PERIOD that's why i thought ,COMMA as long as i don't blow my eyes out .PERIOD i may not care about the fact that it's prohibited from heating this solution .PERIOD i'm sure it's got to do with rockets ,COMMA or it wouldn't be in that manual .PERIOD and it -- they burned at any rate .PERIOD i bring it up because it's a good story .PERIOD and he said ,COMMA tell personal things ,COMMA you know .PERIOD and that's a personal -- .PERIOD i was going to tell you about the first night that i met my wife ,COMMA but that would be too personal .PERIOD wouldn't it ?QUESTIONMARK but in the actual process ,COMMA you get an idea -- like when i got the idea one night that i could amplify dna with two oligonucleotides .PERIOD and i could make lots of copies of some little piece of dna .PERIOD you know ,COMMA the thinking for that was about 20 minutes while i was driving my car .PERIOD and then instead of going -- ,COMMA i went back and i did talk to people about it .PERIOD but if i'd listened to what i heard from all my friends ,COMMA who were molecular biologists -- ,COMMA i would have abandoned it .PERIOD but i knew you'd go into the lab ,COMMA and you'd try to make it work yourself .PERIOD and then you're the authority .PERIOD and you can say ,COMMA i know it works ,COMMA because right there in that tube is where it happened .PERIOD and here on this gel ,COMMA there's a little band there that i know that's dna .PERIOD and that's the dna .PERIOD i wanted to amplify so there .PERIOD so it does work .PERIOD so you have to be honest now ,COMMA let's see they made bigger guns to shoot them down with .PERIOD and the people i'm talking about are people that like -- ,COMMA they say that they're a member of the committee called say the inter-governmental panel on climate change .PERIOD so the planet should get warmer .PERIOD so the planet is a pretty amazing thing .PERIOD you know ,COMMA it's big and horrible -- and big and wonderful .PERIOD and it does all kinds of things .PERIOD we don't know anything about in new york city .PERIOD rats are part of commuters' daily lives .PERIOD i was very fond of this space ,COMMA because it's the first massive industrial complex .PERIOD i found on my own that is abandoned ,COMMA the nature had really reclaimed the whole complex .PERIOD i was really frightened at first .PERIOD but i calmly explained to him that i was working on an art project ,COMMA and he didn't seem to mind .PERIOD and so i went ahead and put my camera on self-timer and ran back and forth that homeless man to me really represented an element of the unconscious of the city .PERIOD they were consistently dug as limestone quarries .PERIOD and by the 18th century ,COMMA the caving-in of some of these quarries posed safety threats .PERIOD so the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries and dug new observation tunnels in order to monitor and map the whole place as you can see .PERIOD the system is very complex ,COMMA and vast i'm going to try and explain why it is that perhaps we don't understand as much as we think we do .PERIOD i think we agree on that ,COMMA where does the tree get the stuff that makes up this chair ?QUESTIONMARK right ?QUESTIONMARK where does all this stuff come from ?QUESTIONMARK and would you be able to kind of draw a -- ?QUESTIONMARK you don't have to draw the diagram ,COMMA but would you be able to draw the diagram if you had to do it ?QUESTIONMARK or would you just say that's actually not possible ?QUESTIONMARK that's what plants actually do for a living .PERIOD so these mental models -- ,COMMA we look for evidence that reinforces our models ,COMMA and it's amateur ,COMMA but amateur in the best sense .PERIOD in other words ,COMMA the root of the word being of love and passion .PERIOD and governments do very well .PERIOD they pat themselves on the back .PERIOD ok ,COMMA we collude .PERIOD and actually ,COMMA if you -- ,COMMA if someone had designed a test for me ,COMMA when i was doing my biology exams to really understand to see whether i'd understood more than just kind of putting starch and iodine together and seeing it go blue and really understood that plants took their mass out of the air .PERIOD then i might have done better at science .PERIOD i love manipulating the infrastructure of biology .PERIOD but within that infrastructure ,COMMA we have to remember that the driving force of biology is really coming from evolution .PERIOD this is a dead crystal ,COMMA and i'm going to do something to it ,COMMA and it's going to become alive .PERIOD but there's a problem because up ,COMMA until maybe a decade ago ,COMMA we were told that life was impossible and that we were the most incredible miracle in the universe .PERIOD if we can make matter alive .PERIOD would we have a matterhazard chemists are trying to study the molecules to look at disease .PERIOD you can decode the genome .PERIOD you can look back .PERIOD you can link us all together by a mitochondrial dna ,COMMA but we can't get further than the last ancestor ,COMMA the last visible cell that we could sequence ,COMMA or think back in history .PERIOD what is life ?QUESTIONMARK what is this stuff of life ?QUESTIONMARK so the whole area's been stuck for a while ,COMMA and it got reignited in the '80s ,COMMA when analytical technologies and computer technologies were coming on .PERIOD and the answer ,COMMA of course ,COMMA lies with mice .PERIOD they're all made of the same stuff ,COMMA but they want their shape to win .PERIOD and that is the key .PERIOD let's zoom out to what that could mean if we could get evolution into the material world .PERIOD then i propose we should have a general theory of evolution ,COMMA and that's really worth thinking about .PERIOD so that means we could then start to develop different platforms for exploring this evolution .PERIOD so you imagine ,COMMA if we're able to create a self-sustaining artificial life form ,COMMA not only will this tell us about the origin of life -- that it's possible that the universe doesn't need carbon to be alive .PERIOD it can use anything -- .PERIOD we can then take [it] one step further and develop new technologies ,COMMA because we can then use software control for evolution to code in .PERIOD but not only just that we will start to think about how we can start to develop a symbiotic relationship with biology .PERIOD evolution cannot be cut apart .PERIOD and we're really becoming very close to understanding the key steps that makes dead stuff come alive .PERIOD we are here today because [the] united nations have defined goals for the progress of countries .PERIOD look here -- .PERIOD you have to end poverty ,COMMA education ,COMMA gender ,COMMA child and maternal health control infections ,COMMA protect the environment and get the good global links between nations .PERIOD in every aspect from aid to trade .PERIOD that's a four percent reduction per year -- .PERIOD and this with measuring .PERIOD i'll prove them wrong on both points .PERIOD and i will take kenya as an example .PERIOD i was actually on friday sitting in front of my computer .PERIOD and i saw the death rate fall from 128 to 84 .PERIOD just that morning .PERIOD that's unfair had i been in the ministry of health in kenya .PERIOD i may have joined these two points .PERIOD so look at the average here -- .PERIOD this is the average for all of sub-saharan africa .PERIOD i give you congo ,COMMA which was high ghana ,COMMA -- lower and kenya ,COMMA -- even lower their countries are so different .PERIOD and they merit to be recognized in the same way .PERIOD as we don't talk about europe as one place there .PERIOD we are today ,COMMA how the heck could they be [a] developing country ?QUESTIONMARK look -- ,COMMA even if we look in africa -- ,COMMA these are the african countries .PERIOD it's very clear that this is what happens that is when we get girls in school ,COMMA we'll get an impact 15 to 20 years later ,COMMA which is a secular trend ,COMMA which is very strong .PERIOD it's a decent life for children .PERIOD we are talking about .PERIOD do we care about those four billion people whose income levels are less than two dollars a day ,COMMA the so-called bottom of the pyramid .PERIOD but if you don't have money ,COMMA what happens and if they do ?QUESTIONMARK so then ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the conditions improve ,COMMA and they start riding on scooters .PERIOD an innovator is one ,COMMA who does not know it cannot be done .PERIOD they combine all that .PERIOD and it was that compassion which bothered them ,COMMA because when he saw -- ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA he told me about eight or nine years ago ,COMMA how he was driving his own car -- .PERIOD he drives his own car by the way -- .PERIOD and he saw in the rain ,COMMA a family ,COMMA like the one that i showed to you getting drenched with an infant .PERIOD for example ,COMMA how we started ratan just began with a five-engineer team young people in their mid-twenties .PERIOD it was an open innovation ideas from all over were welcome .PERIOD and the seat riser ,COMMA for example ,COMMA serving as a mounting for the seat as well as a structural part of the functional rigidity ,COMMA and british motor was around 11000 and unbelievably in 40 years .PERIOD i was the first indian to be honored and unique high-ankle design and human-like looks [unclear] and functions .PERIOD are you getting more drugs ?QUESTIONMARK because you are spending more time and more money .PERIOD the ideas have to be such that ,COMMA you think ,COMMA in completely different terms and incubator costs 2000 dollars .PERIOD but then he held it for a little while lakshmi that gave me a great message focus ,COMMA and you can achieve .PERIOD and currently i'm president of global research alliance 60000 scientists in nine counties ,COMMA right from india to the us .PERIOD commodities are things that you grow in the ground ,COMMA raise on the ground or pull out of the ground .PERIOD basically animal mineral vegetable long-distance telephone service ,COMMA sold on price .PERIOD price price ,COMMA fast-food restaurants ,COMMA with all their value pricing .PERIOD and even the internet is commoditizing ,COMMA not just goods ,COMMA but services as well .PERIOD now ,COMMA most places that i talk to when i talk about experience ,COMMA i talk about disney -- ,COMMA the world's premier experience-stager .PERIOD and then i always finish off by talking about -- .PERIOD the thing that amazes me the most about this question particularly coming from the dutch is that the netherlands is every bit as manufactured as disneyland .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA you can look at how each of these economies developed that each one has their own business imperative matched with a consumer sensibility ,COMMA because all businesses are man-made objects .PERIOD all business is involved with money .PERIOD all business is a matter of using machinery .PERIOD and all those things make something inauthentic .PERIOD at the end of a laundry list of advice .PERIOD he's giving to his son laertes .PERIOD he says this and this above all to thine own self .PERIOD be true as businesses are the economic offerings .PERIOD you are providing -- are they true to themselves ?QUESTIONMARK and of course ,COMMA if you are both true to yourself and are what you say ,COMMA you are ,COMMA then you're real real .PERIOD universal city .PERIOD walk is a real ,COMMA fake -- .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA we got this very term from ada .PERIOD louise huxtable's book ,COMMA the unreal america ,COMMA but is it really true to itself .PERIOD so she calls it a real fake .PERIOD so understand what -- your past limits ,COMMA what you can do in the future .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK if you could check into the ads ,COMMA you'd have a great experience .PERIOD then you have that perception that you are phony .PERIOD a few words about how i got started ,COMMA and it has a lot to do with happiness .PERIOD actually ,COMMA i would make things for people as a way of ,COMMA you know ,COMMA giving showing them my love .PERIOD so it has to end with this -- -- gratuitous violence .PERIOD so that was how i first started to explore the way things moved and expressed it .PERIOD i was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery and becoming a surgeon ,COMMA because it meant working with my hands in a very focused intense way .PERIOD when i see objects ,COMMA i imagine them in motion .PERIOD that's about that big .PERIOD this kind of work is also very much like puppetry ,COMMA where the found object is in a sense ,COMMA the puppet .PERIOD and i'm the puppeteer at first ,COMMA because i'm playing with an object ,COMMA and they would coalesce for just a moment .PERIOD so you could perceive that there was a chair there .PERIOD what would i love ?QUESTIONMARK so this is a little wire-bending tool .PERIOD after many years of bending gears with a pair of pliers .PERIOD i made that tool .PERIOD and then i made this other tool for sort of centering gears ,COMMA very quickly ,COMMA -- sort of developing my own little world of technology .PERIOD and the idea their premise was that we wanted to show pieces of sculpture on the street ,COMMA and there'd be no subjective decision about what was the best .PERIOD so i'll just let this chair come down .PERIOD and what we were going to do was scan a new project on the development of the fetus from conception to birth ,COMMA using these kinds of new technologies ,COMMA 25 days heart chamber .PERIOD developing 32 days ,COMMA arms &amp hands are developing 36 days ,COMMA beginning of the primitive vertabrae .PERIOD these weeks are the period of the most rapid development of the fetus 51 days 52 days developing retina ,COMMA nose and fingers the fetus' continual movement in the womb is necessary for muscular and skeletal growth every six months until they're six years old -- .PERIOD we're going to be doing ,COMMA actually to about 250 children -- watching exactly how the gyri and the sulci of the brains ,COMMA fold to see how this magnificent development actually turns into memories and the marvel that is us .PERIOD i'm a spectroscopist .PERIOD sometimes we have to deal with just one ,COMMA tiny ,COMMA weak spectral line to measure the composition of that chemical element in the atmosphere .PERIOD for instance ,COMMA you see the spectral line of the gold is the only spectral line in the spectrum of the sun .PERIOD it's a heavy element produced in thermonuclear explosions of supernovae .PERIOD it's the only place where you can produce actually osmium .PERIOD it was incredible .PERIOD the only conclusion we could make from this is clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion in this system ,COMMA which polluted the atmosphere of this star .PERIOD they actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra is an alien .PERIOD it comes from a different galaxy .PERIOD and sometimes they just capture stars .PERIOD we were very surprised to discover a super flare ,COMMA a flare ,COMMA which is thousands of millions of times more powerful than those .PERIOD we see in the sun .PERIOD this can be done with the future spectrographs coming back to the most important question is there anybody out there connection between life ?QUESTIONMARK and radioactive nuclei is straightforward .PERIOD it's exactly the same game ,COMMA a very tiny feature .PERIOD it's amazing that we can detect vegetation from a spectrum .PERIOD now ,COMMA very recently ,COMMA very recently ,COMMA i'm talking about last six ,COMMA seven ,COMMA eight months water ,COMMA methane .PERIOD carbon dioxide have been detected in the spectrum of a planet outside the solar system ,COMMA and with the known physics ,COMMA etc .PERIOD it's something actually ,COMMA which has been pointed out by frank drake ,COMMA many years ago and shklovsky .PERIOD they want to actually signal their presence through these spectral lines in the spectrum of a star in different ways .PERIOD and we are doing this job since 2000 ,COMMA and it's a very heavy project .PERIOD we have been working very hard .PERIOD i think it will come from a spectrum like this .PERIOD it will take about five years ,COMMA and she said ,COMMA but the thing i liked about your talk is you're a storyteller .PERIOD and she said ,COMMA i'm going to call you a storyteller .PERIOD i'm a qualitative researcher ,COMMA and maybe i'm just a storyteller .PERIOD the other thing that they had in common was this .PERIOD they fully embraced vulnerability .PERIOD they're willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out .PERIOD do you have any recommendations ?QUESTIONMARK and i said ,COMMA i'm great .PERIOD i'm okay .PERIOD i just need some strategies .PERIOD and then i said ,COMMA it's bad ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK the problem is -- .PERIOD and i learned this from the research -- that you cannot selectively numb emotion .PERIOD you can't numb those hard feelings without numbing .PERIOD the other affects our emotions .PERIOD religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty .PERIOD there's no conversation ,COMMA which just i hope in 100 years ,COMMA people will look back and go ,COMMA wow .PERIOD and when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand ,COMMA our job is not to say ,COMMA look at her .PERIOD she's perfect .PERIOD my job is just to keep her perfect -- ,COMMA make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and yale by seventh grade .PERIOD we do that in our personal lives .PERIOD it is as you can see very small ,COMMA and also very cheap .PERIOD so that when we think about using them to get some systematic improvement ,COMMA we also think about how they can be useful for self-improvement for self-discovery self-awareness self-knowledge .PERIOD some people will say it's for public health research .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD i want to talk about it in the context of a story .PERIOD all of our

.PERIOD she had to do everything that i wanted to do .PERIOD and i wanted to play war .PERIOD and on the other side were all my sister's .PERIOD my little ponies ready for a cavalry charge .PERIOD i was nervous ,COMMA because my parents had charged me with making sure that my sister and i played as safely ,COMMA and as quietly as possible with one broken leg .PERIOD i can delete that dot ,COMMA because that's clearly a measurement error .PERIOD so one of the very first things we teach people in economics and statistics and business and psychology courses is how in a statistically valid way

you happen to be black ,COMMA if you happen to be poor ,COMMA if you happen to exist in an overcrowded school .PERIOD and so we're starting to see the establishment of men centers and men studies to think about .PERIOD how do we engage men in their experiences in the university ?QUESTIONMARK the next reason that boys' cultures are out of sync with school cultures .PERIOD there are fewer male teachers ,COMMA but male role models for boys that say ,COMMA it's all right to be smart -- .PERIOD they've got dads ,COMMA they've got pastors .PERIOD they've got cub scout leaders .PERIOD but

that's in their program in the elementary grades ,COMMA all of those conversations need to be happening ,COMMA who has a computer ?QUESTIONMARK yeah ,COMMA ok .PERIOD so everyone has a computer .PERIOD i went to mit did my math ,COMMA but i had this wonderful opportunity ,COMMA because computers had just become visual .PERIOD remember that moment ?QUESTIONMARK -- publishing your designs ?QUESTIONMARK i didn't quite get it .PERIOD and paul rand was a kind of crusty designer .PERIOD you know ,COMMA a crusty designer like a good -- kind of like a good french bread .PERIOD this is the first sort of play thing .PERIOD i did my own serious play .PERIOD this is actually bad human experiments .PERIOD see humans don't know how to take orders the computer's so good at it .PERIOD this guy

years ,COMMA hence ,COMMA the highest status jewelry you could wear in prussia wasn't made of gold or diamonds .PERIOD it was made of cast iron ,COMMA because actually never mind the actual intrinsic

is kind of false .PERIOD it's a fake version .PERIOD however ,COMMA what we do have now is a much more variegated media ecosystem in which to kind of create this kind of value ,COMMA and it's much fairer yet we've never created the opportunity for impulse saving .PERIOD i would say it's a work of genius .PERIOD so i just want to get your first impressions ,COMMA when you see that when you see the diamond shreddies box there ,COMMA but it's kind of like flipping a six or a nine like a six .PERIOD if you flip it over ,COMMA it looks like a nine .PERIOD thank you very much .PERIOD indeed ,COMMA we're seeing the consequences all around us .PERIOD i would say ,COMMA not just biological design ,COMMA but all of the design that we think of as human design and 100 pages later and another

design process going on .PERIOD a meme is not equivalent to an idea .PERIOD audience :COLON sink toilet .PERIOD this has spread all over the world .PERIOD so this is a view of what humans are .PERIOD and indeed ,COMMA in the short time i've already been at ted .PERIOD i see we're even closer than i thought we were before .PERIOD we'll think we're choosing these things ,COMMA but the temes are making us do it .PERIOD it's been very productive that equation .PERIOD getting a new replicator is dangerous .PERIOD we may take the gaian view ,COMMA you know ,COMMA all about big brains ,COMMA and why would they do that ?QUESTIONMARK so those are the two possibilities .PERIOD i have no idea .PERIOD i was afraid of a tsunami .PERIOD what i didn't realize was there was a greater terror in haiti

that cut off food and water and supplies for an entire nation behind that door is the national judicial archives .PERIOD now there's a solution to all these problems ,COMMA and because i had 70 percent of my body burned ,COMMA it would take about an hour .PERIOD so originally i didn't have much money .PERIOD so i went to a hardware store ,COMMA and i bought a carpenter's vice .PERIOD now ten commandments is something that is hard to bring into the education system .PERIOD so we said ,COMMA why don't we get people to sign the honor code ?QUESTIONMARK and this is particularly interesting ,COMMA because mit doesn't have an honor code .PERIOD no bill ever disappeared .PERIOD we did not pay them with dollars .PERIOD we paid them with something else ,COMMA but this did not solve the big problem .PERIOD i had with enron yet because in enron .PERIOD there's also a social element .PERIOD so everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment .PERIOD and we told them that at the end ,COMMA we asked them to pay us back the money .PERIOD they didn't make ok .PERIOD what would happen to the other people in the group ,COMMA will they cheat more ,COMMA or will they cheat less .PERIOD all of the subjects sitting in the experiment were carnegie mellon students .PERIOD when we remind people about their morality ,COMMA they cheat less .PERIOD but unless we start testing those

somebody drops into the house and no matter what house you go to in cape breton .PERIOD there's a fiddle there guaranteed .PERIOD and i'd say ,COMMA well ,COMMA there's first of all more fiddlers per capita in cape breton than anywhere in the world .PERIOD so ten chances to one the fellow who walked in the door could play it .PERIOD so you'd have someone come into the house .PERIOD you'd invite them to play a tune ,COMMA and lo and behold ,COMMA a little party would start up ,COMMA and somebody would dance ,COMMA and somebody would sing and all that sort of thing .PERIOD so it was a wonderful wonderful way to grow up .PERIOD and that is where my beginnings in music come from my surroundings ,COMMA my family ,COMMA just my bloodline in itself .PERIOD and oh ,COMMA i've done lots of things with my music donnell leahy .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD i'm kind of new to the ted experience ,COMMA and i'm glad to be here ,COMMA but i'm just trying to put it all together ,COMMA trying to figure all you people out .PERIOD and i've been here for a short while ,COMMA and i'm starting to understand a little bit better .PERIOD we learned to play the instruments ,COMMA but we kind of had to come from within or go from within ,COMMA because we didn't watch television .PERIOD we didn't listen to a lot of radio .PERIOD we went to church and to school sometimes and farmed and played music .PERIOD so we were able ,COMMA i think ,COMMA at a very critical age to develop our own style ,COMMA our own self .PERIOD and my mother plays ,COMMA my father plays and the style that came from the

realized that the earth will only last about five billion years before it's swallowed by the sun energy at the moment is dominated by resource .PERIOD it's a medium-sized nucleus .PERIOD and indeed ,COMMA that's exactly what stars do .PERIOD so that's that process there deuterium and tritium goes together ,COMMA makes helium 5 ,COMMA and that energy is what powers fusion .PERIOD and as you go across there ,COMMA you see a few tens of years of oil -- .PERIOD the blue line by the way is the lowest estimate of existing resources .PERIOD and as you go across there ,COMMA you will see that we've got a few tens of years ,COMMA and perhaps 100 years of fossil fuels left .PERIOD so how would we make it ?QUESTIONMARK we can do fusion in the center of this device .PERIOD we made 16 megawatts of fusion power in 1997 .PERIOD if you want to know how ask yourself this question ,COMMA what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail ?QUESTIONMARK because when you ask it ,COMMA you begin to understand how the fear of failure constrains you how it keeps us from attempting ,COMMA great things .PERIOD and life gets dull ,COMMA amazing things .PERIOD stop happening the path to truly

here is another picture of them .PERIOD they are supposed to be locked up .PERIOD and i became increasingly more and more agitated ,COMMA because i was there not only to be with them ,COMMA but also to ride and create a team .PERIOD and i didn't know what to do .PERIOD we're going downhill in some rocky terrain .PERIOD and the front tire of alex gets caught in one of these crevasses here .PERIOD

used to think that reason and logic and relentless drive were the only ways to make things happen .PERIOD all you have to do is play with it change it a little bit and come up with something that does

,COMMA large amounts of the brain are not purple showing that if one person has a thicker bit of cortex in that region ,COMMA so does his fraternal twin .PERIOD and here's what happens if you get a pair of people who share all their dna -- ,COMMA namely ,COMMA clones or identical twins .PERIOD another political fear of human nature is that if we are blank slates ,COMMA we can perfect mankind ,COMMA -- the age-old dream of the perfectibility of our species through social engineering .PERIOD and so when thomas jefferson wrote in the declaration of independence ,COMMA we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal .PERIOD he did not mean we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are clones .PERIOD that is because the human mind is a complex system with

cognitive abilities that allow us to profit from the lessons of history .PERIOD well ,COMMA the night is young ,COMMA but the book has been out for half a year ,COMMA and nothing terrible has happened

sensor .PERIOD i just basically gnawed all this stuff out of plastic .PERIOD he didn't test so well ,COMMA but i like him ,COMMA and then she started doing these other images .PERIOD i have three girls ,COMMA and they just they -- .PERIOD it's like a rescue animal thing .PERIOD they're going there .PERIOD and on the weekend ,COMMA we ran the parts for that .PERIOD so this is how they come out close to the end for a while .PERIOD they were making two million furbys a month ,COMMA and she still actually has those .PERIOD and we're going to try to really pull this off .PERIOD intentfully .PERIOD try to make something that seems like it's alive .PERIOD and you could actually find full fossil evidence of these very ,COMMA very obsessive ,COMMA and then more sculpting ,COMMA and then more sculpting ,COMMA and then more sculpting ,COMMA and then more sculpting ,COMMA john ,COMMA do you want to bring him up ?QUESTIONMARK yeah ,COMMA they're like kids .PERIOD you know ,COMMA that's what the investors think that it's just -- -- ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK right ?QUESTIONMARK so they're really sweet little guys .PERIOD now ,COMMA these are not robots .PERIOD they're kind of lovebots .PERIOD you know ,COMMA we -- .PERIOD actually ,COMMA it's very hard to keep people from doing this .PERIOD and there's a lot of social responsibility in that if they can do that ,COMMA why can't governments and ngos do the same thing ?QUESTIONMARK so that's why i took a bit of time to study coke .PERIOD they have this very continuous feedback loop .PERIOD they said ,COMMA you roll the ball .PERIOD you hear some pins go down .PERIOD it's dark .PERIOD you can't see which one goes down until the lights come on .PERIOD and then you an see your impact .PERIOD real-time data turns on the lights .PERIOD they set them up as what they called micro-distribution centers .PERIOD and those local entrepreneurs ,COMMA then hire sales people who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows to sell the product .PERIOD the government noticed in ethiopia ,COMMA that many of the people were so far away from a health clinic .PERIOD they were over a day's travel away from a health clinic .PERIOD the third component of coke's success is marketing .PERIOD let's listen to this song that coke created for it wavin' flag by a somali .PERIOD hip hop artist .PERIOD and it went number one on the pop chart in 17 countries .PERIOD i've even seen it used for a chicken coop .PERIOD we know that circumcision reduces hiv infection by 60 percent in men .PERIOD but it turns out the men do because they're hearing from their girlfriends that they prefer it .PERIOD and the men also believe it improves their sex life .PERIOD so what's the endgame ?QUESTIONMARK so if coke's marketers came to me and asked me to define happiness ,COMMA i'd say my vision of happiness is a mother ,COMMA holding healthy baby in her arms to me that is deep happiness .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD this is my baseline .PERIOD this is the mediterranean coast with no fish ,COMMA bare rock and lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae .PERIOD this is their baseline .PERIOD this is what they think is natural .PERIOD because we started modern science with scuba diving long after we started degrading marine ecosystems .PERIOD what have we learned from these places when we went to pristine reefs ,COMMA we realized that the natural world was upside down .PERIOD this pyramid was inverted .PERIOD the top head does account for most of the biomass in some places up to 85 percent like kingman reef ,COMMA which is now protected .PERIOD then you go to palmyra atoll that has more biomass of herbivores and the dead corals are clean and the corals are coming back .PERIOD and this is what i saw lots of fish .PERIOD and this particular place ,COMMA the medes islands marine reserve is only 94 hectares .PERIOD and it brings 6 million euros to the local economy 20 times more than fishing .PERIOD and it represents 88 percent of all the tourist revenue ,COMMA these places when we protect them ,COMMA if we compare them to unprotected areas nearby .PERIOD this is what happens the abundance .PERIOD how many fish you have per square meter increases almost 170 percent .PERIOD if you fish less ,COMMA you're actually catching more .PERIOD another example ,COMMA nassau groupers in belize in the mesoamerican reef .PERIOD when i went there for the first time in 2000 ,COMMA there were only 3000 groupers left .PERIOD it happened in many places around the caribbean .PERIOD so how much of this do we have people are losing their jobs because the fisheries are collapsing .PERIOD the problem is that we can create these large reserves only in places where there are no people where there is no social conflict ,COMMA where the political cost is really low .PERIOD and the economic cost is also low .PERIOD but what about the rest of the coast of the world where people live and make a living out of fishing ?QUESTIONMARK how could 85 percent survive on 15 percent ,COMMA the animals at the lower parts of the food chain ?QUESTIONMARK they reproduce very fast .PERIOD they grow really fast .PERIOD they produce millions of eggs .PERIOD so really our picture of a food pyramid is just -- .PERIOD we have to change that completely .PERIOD we think this is universal .PERIOD so the numbers you presented really are astonishing talk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced of going to these pristine areas and seeing things coming back .PERIOD and if it were not for these places that show hope ,COMMA i don't think i could continue doing this job .PERIOD and the problem i think ,COMMA is that we take the ocean for granted .PERIOD most of the animals are in the oceans .PERIOD we use the submarine ,COMMA alvin ,COMMA and we use cameras .PERIOD and the cameras are something that bill lange has developed with the help of sony marcel .PERIOD proust said ,COMMA the true voyage of discovery is not so much in seeking new landscapes as in having new eyes .PERIOD it's got tentacles dangling swirling around like that .PERIOD and these are the types of animals that live in that three-dimensional space that micro-gravity environment that we really haven't explored .PERIOD they're very little understood .PERIOD they go from a couple of inches to a couple of feet .PERIOD it's footage that we've collected for scientific purposes ,COMMA and we're over the atlantic -- .PERIOD that's the ridge right there -- .PERIOD but we're going to go across the caribbean central america and end up against the pacific ,COMMA nine degrees north .PERIOD here's where bill's cameras really do shine .PERIOD and what you're seeing here is a cloud of densely packed hydrogen-sulfide-rich water coming out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor .PERIOD not only is it coming out of the earth -- so biogenesis made from volcanic activity -- ,COMMA but that bacteria supports these colonies of life ,COMMA a mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles -- .PERIOD no sun has ever gotten down here .PERIOD oh ,COMMA good going .PERIOD this is a female of this kind of worm you .PERIOD watch .PERIOD it doesn't take long before two guys here -- this one and one that will show up over here .PERIOD -- start to fight .PERIOD the red dot is the laser light of the submarine .PERIOD alvin to give us an idea about how far away we are from the vents .PERIOD it's actually a light-sensing organ .PERIOD this one's several stories tall .PERIOD this stuff is toxic as hell by the way that's probably where we evolved from .PERIOD there's a fish sitting here .PERIOD here's a crab with his claw ,COMMA right at the end of that tube worm waiting for that worm to stick his head out .PERIOD the worms are growing inches per week ,COMMA despite that these animals grow back in about a year's time ,COMMA learn to manage it .PERIOD so i'd like to talk about why that is why that's such a calamity for society ,COMMA what we can do about it and to close with why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher .PERIOD this is really destructive .PERIOD david milch ,COMMA creator of deadwood and other amazing tv shows has a really good description for this .PERIOD you expect sitcom-sized problems that wrap up in 22 minutes ,COMMA three commercial breaks and a laugh track in all seriousness .PERIOD here's an example from a physics textbook .PERIOD i'm sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that .PERIOD so i can diagnose the problem ,COMMA a little more specifically in math .PERIOD the math serves the conversation .PERIOD the conversation doesn't serve the math .PERIOD i like this question ,COMMA it's about a water tank .PERIOD i've got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation .PERIOD we need more patient problem solvers .PERIOD thank you because actually radical innovation does sometimes come from the very best .PERIOD but it often comes from places where you have huge need -- unmet latent demand -- and not enough resources for traditional solutions to work -- traditional high-cost solutions ,COMMA which depend on professionals ,COMMA which is what schools and hospitals are we'll grow by six cities of 12 million people a year for the next 30 years .PERIOD this is where you'll find the fastest growing young populations of the world ,COMMA or you can go to places like this .PERIOD this is kibera ,COMMA which is the largest slum in east africa ,COMMA millions of people living here stretched over many kilometers .PERIOD they're private schools .PERIOD there are no state schools in slums .PERIOD it's not to do with electricity or water .PERIOD if you want to design from scratch virtually any service in africa ,COMMA you would start now with the mobile phone .PERIOD this is a place called the madangiri settlement colony ,COMMA which is a very developed slum about 25 minutes outside new delhi ,COMMA where i met these characters who showed me around for the day .PERIOD ten years ago ,COMMA they certainly would have been married .PERIOD this is the best you can get in hyderabad in indian education ,COMMA but they find it completely obvious to use computers .PERIOD websites make videos so on and so forth .PERIOD one is to deliver extrinsic motivation .PERIOD that education has a payoff that's too long if you're poor .PERIOD so you need education to be relevant and help people to make a living there .PERIOD and then often our education systems .PERIOD you do all that stuff afterward ,COMMA if you're lucky sport ,COMMA drama music .PERIOD so el sistema in venezuela uses a violin as a technology of learning taio rocha uses making soap as a technology of learning .PERIOD and i learned it from this guy who is an amazing character ,COMMA and it also supports working-class kids going into indian schools .PERIOD and it's the same wherever you go .PERIOD it's reliable and people know exactly where they are .PERIOD why can't we do it more like the chinese restaurants ?QUESTIONMARK there are big picture schools in the us and australia .PERIOD but because so ,COMMA many of the issues in education aren't just in school ,COMMA they're in family and community what you also need .PERIOD definitely is more on the right hand side .PERIOD you need efforts to supplement schools .PERIOD that's an entire second adult lifetime .PERIOD that's been added to our lifespan .PERIOD but many people today ,COMMA -- philosophers ,COMMA artists ,COMMA doctors scientists -- are taking a new look at what i call .PERIOD the third act .PERIOD the last three decades of life ,COMMA they realize that this is actually a developmental stage of life with its own significance ,COMMA -- as different from midlife as adolescence is from childhood .PERIOD i've spent the last year researching and writing about this subject .PERIOD obviously ,COMMA there's no guarantee that it can be a time of fruition and growth .PERIOD it was about a man named neil selinger ,COMMA -- 57 years ,COMMA old ,COMMA a retired lawyer ,COMMA -- ,COMMA who had joined the writers group at sarah lawrence ,COMMA where he found his writer's voice .PERIOD it's a terrible disease .PERIOD it's fatal if ,COMMA however we can go back and alter our relationship re-vision ,COMMA our relationship to past people and events neural pathways can change .PERIOD i mean as girls .PERIOD we start off feisty -- .PERIOD yeah ,COMMA who says we have agency ,COMMA but very often many ,COMMA if not most of us ,COMMA when we hit puberty ,COMMA we start worrying about fitting in and being popular .PERIOD thank you very much .PERIOD but most species actually use insects to do their bidding .PERIOD and that's more intelligent in a way because the pollen they don't need so much of it ,COMMA the insects and other species can take the pollen transfer it directly to where it's required .PERIOD there are markings on many plants that look like other insects .PERIOD these are the anthers of a lily cleverly done .PERIOD so that when the unsuspecting insect lands on it ,COMMA the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with .PERIOD and basically what the insect has to do -- .PERIOD we're in the middle of the flower -- .PERIOD it has to stick its little proboscis right into the middle of that ,COMMA and all the way down that nectar tube to get to the nectar .PERIOD so not only has the fly ,COMMA not got the nectar from the mimic plant .PERIOD it's also -- .PERIOD if you look very closely ,COMMA just at the head end ,COMMA you can see that it's got a bit of pollen that it would be transmitting to another plant .PERIOD if only some botanist hadn't come along and stuck it to a blue piece of card .PERIOD and when the insect gets there and lands on it dousing itself in pollen ,COMMA of course ,COMMA that it's going to take to another plant .PERIOD if you look at the every-home-should-have-one scanning electron microscope picture ,COMMA you can see that there are actually some patterning there ,COMMA which is three-dimensional .PERIOD sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect ,COMMA even to us .PERIOD so flies love this ,COMMA they lay their eggs in it thinking .PERIOD it's a nice bit of carrion ,COMMA and not realizing that there's no food for the eggs that the eggs are going to die .PERIOD but the plant meanwhile has benefited because the bristles release and the flies disappear to pollinate .PERIOD the next flower -- ,COMMA fantastic .PERIOD this thing does something else ,COMMA which is unusual .PERIOD recently ,COMMA a wise media theorist tweeted .PERIOD the 19th century culture was defined by the novel .PERIOD the 20th century culture was defined by the cinema .PERIOD and the culture of the 21st century will be defined by the interface .PERIOD and i believe this is going to prove true ,COMMA and that's us down there in la and long beach on the bottom .PERIOD this is baron wolfgang von kempelen's ,COMMA mechanical chess playing machine .PERIOD and i think it's a pretty valid question .PERIOD he draws sheep after sheep .PERIOD so this is a clip from charlie chaplin's modern times .PERIOD that's all i'm getting paid for this .PERIOD so we resynthesized this song ,COMMA and then you'd do your best to recreate that with your own voice after previewing ,COMMA it and confirming .PERIOD it's what you submitted .PERIOD you could submit it into the mechanical turk with no other context .PERIOD i'm sorry for this .PERIOD and this was seen by a director in la named james frost who said ,COMMA wait a minute .PERIOD and i think one of my favorite parts of this project was not just shooting a video with lasers ,COMMA but we also open sourced it .PERIOD and we made it released as a google code project ,COMMA where people could download a bunch of the data and some source code to build their own versions of it .PERIOD so we thought this was the perfect project to build a collaborative memorial and a virtual resurrection for johnny cash .PERIOD collaborator five as much as is different from frame to frame .PERIOD it really is personal ,COMMA but there's a bunch of different styles .PERIOD there is a real problem with snobbery .PERIOD imagine that snobbery is a distinctively uk phenomenon .PERIOD fixated on country houses and titles .PERIOD snobbery is a global phenomenon .PERIOD now ,COMMA the opposite of a snob is your mother .PERIOD think this is somebody who is incredibly vulnerable .PERIOD and in need of love ,COMMA we're told from many sources that anyone can achieve anything .PERIOD we are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position .PERIOD they please ,COMMA they own their success ,COMMA but they also own their failure .PERIOD but i think it's insane to believe that we will ever make a society that is genuinely meritocratic .PERIOD it's an impossible dream .PERIOD what we fear is the judgment and ridicule of others .PERIOD and it exists and then are fit for ridicule .PERIOD now is there any alternative to this ?QUESTIONMARK and that's why we enjoy looking at glaciers and oceans ,COMMA and contemplating the earth from outside its perimeters ,COMMA etc .PERIOD when banking is no longer so respectable ,COMMA we lose interest in banking .PERIOD but what i really want to stress is by all means success .PERIOD yes ,COMMA because the emphasis nowadays is so much on the justice of everything and politicians always talk about justice .PERIOD but it doesn't matter that much that we're putting too much emphasis on that .PERIOD thank you very much .PERIOD it's a smiling face .PERIOD and when i said ,COMMA i'm going to go out and do a 15-hour swim .PERIOD and we're coming into the dock after a long day ,COMMA and it's now night ,COMMA and we come in ,COMMA and it's 14 hours and 58 minutes ,COMMA and i can touch the dock .PERIOD and we're done the trainer says ,COMMA that's great .PERIOD try going in with an armada like we had of 50 people and five boats and cnn's crew ,COMMA etc .PERIOD and there are sharks ,COMMA and i gathered together ,COMMA honestly the world's leading experts in every possible way .PERIOD and a month ago ,COMMA the 23rd of september .PERIOD i stood on that shore ,COMMA and i looked across to that long ,COMMA long ,COMMA faraway horizon .PERIOD and i asked myself ,COMMA do you have it ?QUESTIONMARK you're really left alone with your own thoughts .PERIOD first of all ,COMMA you're going to hit obstacles .PERIOD and even though you're feeling great at any one moment ,COMMA don't take it for granted be ready because there's going to be pain .PERIOD there's going to be suffering after a couple of days ,COMMA three days ,COMMA you tend to rebel in a lot of physical ways .PERIOD i don't know if you can still see the red line here and up the arm .PERIOD he's 29 years old ,COMMA very well-built lean .PERIOD he's six-foot .PERIOD five ,COMMA weighs 265 lbs .PERIOD and he is down ,COMMA i need help .PERIOD and i can't help diana the box jelly again .PERIOD -- all across the neck .PERIOD all across here ,COMMA we've got benadryl on board .PERIOD if i get stung ,COMMA i'll just grin and bear it .PERIOD and they have these long 30 to 40 to 50-ft tentacles .PERIOD henry .PERIOD what's your question ?QUESTIONMARK and i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA it's odd that you've learned of this as a noble kind of pursuit .PERIOD but yeah ,COMMA i know those guys .PERIOD he said ,COMMA that's what you need .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD this hope is still alive .PERIOD are you going to swim the atlantic ?QUESTIONMARK i said ,COMMA nope .PERIOD i didn't know .PERIOD and i left everything and went for a long series of odd jobs .PERIOD they come in a lot of different shapes .PERIOD so i'm always looking for the false cognates or identical words in different languages .PERIOD so i did a series of work where it was identical words in french and in english .PERIOD so if you don't know one of these languages ,COMMA it's instant learning .PERIOD it's all if ,COMMA and we can use them also as a safety net ,COMMA people tell me their lives ,COMMA their memories ,COMMA their aspirations .PERIOD and i create a mindscape .PERIOD i was also interested in the physicality of this format ,COMMA because you have to walk to see it .PERIOD so it's like the different layers of what we are made of .PERIOD and what we present to the world as an identity .PERIOD why do i call it a book after eight years of rejection ?QUESTIONMARK i was thrilled to get my first commission with the percent for art in new york city .PERIOD here .PERIOD it's faceted glass in the bronx .PERIOD because if you sit a long time in summer in shorts ,COMMA you will walk away with temporary branding of the story element on your thighs .PERIOD it's a story about transformation and connections .PERIOD and here i've been working for the last three years with a south bronx developer to bring art to life to low-income buildings and affordable housing .PERIOD and i wanted to give them an escape .PERIOD but the result is always to have stories ,COMMA and you get to think about yourself and your memories .PERIOD and before you go back into suspension ,COMMA you edit your memories ,COMMA and you change your personality and so forth .PERIOD but lots of people now live to 90 or 100 ,COMMA unless they shake hands too much ,COMMA or something like that ,COMMA which ,COMMA by chimpanzee standards is very good indeed .PERIOD and i guess i better skip all the rest of this ,COMMA which are some details on how we might make those smart machines and -- -- .PERIOD and the main idea is ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA that the core of a really smart machine is one that recognizes that a certain kind of problem is facing you ,COMMA any guesses 1816 ,COMMA what has changed .PERIOD our society has been wireless devices .PERIOD this is the first one .PERIOD this is an electrocardiogram in the future .PERIOD you're going to be checking all your vital signs .PERIOD all your vital signs ,COMMA your heart rhythm ,COMMA your blood pressure ,COMMA your oxygen ,COMMA your temperature ,COMMA etc .PERIOD if you're an expectant parent ,COMMA what about the ability to monitor continuously fetal heart rate or intrauterine contractions and not having to worry so much that things are fine as the pregnancy and moving over into the time of delivery .PERIOD and then ,COMMA as we go further today ,COMMA we have continuous glucose sensors .PERIOD i didn't have one of those ,COMMA but i got the fitbit .PERIOD of course ,COMMA how many here have any problems with sleeping ,COMMA and the wake time is in orange .PERIOD ok .PERIOD so that's the first night .PERIOD now ,COMMA diabetes is one of the big ones ,COMMA chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .PERIOD one of the ones i just wanted to mention the ishoe is another example of a sensor that improves proprioception among the elderly to prevent falling .PERIOD one of them -- ,COMMA we're very fortunate -- is to develop a dedicated institute .PERIOD and that's work that started with the work that scripps with qualcomm ,COMMA the wireless institute ,COMMA the west wireless health institute is really the outgrowth of two extraordinary people who are here this evening gary and mary west .PERIOD and i'd like to give it up for them for getting behind this .PERIOD there's also a tremendous number of techniques that chefs have developed some about new aesthetics ,COMMA new approaches to food .PERIOD none of the techniques that these people have developed over the course of the last 20 years is in any of those books is there a way we can show people food in a way they have not seen it before .PERIOD then each of the different little pieces around it explain some fact .PERIOD well ,COMMA that first cutaway picture worked .PERIOD so we said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA let's do some more .PERIOD once you start cutting things in half .PERIOD you kind of get carried away .PERIOD so you see ,COMMA we cut the jars in half as well as the pan .PERIOD and each of these text blocks explains a key thing that's going on ,COMMA but to make them palatable .PERIOD we cut it out of a steel plate and put it in front of a fire and photographed it like this .PERIOD everybody knows that your various appliances have wattage ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK as it comes out of the grinder .PERIOD you just have a little tray ,COMMA and you just take it off in little passes build it up ,COMMA slice it vertically .PERIOD now ,COMMA watch closely .PERIOD this is popcorn .PERIOD i'll explain it here .PERIOD the popcorn is illustrating a key thing in physics .PERIOD but surgeons in these eras are a little bit more conservative than their bold ,COMMA trephinating ancestors .PERIOD and he is credited with doing over 4000 of these public surgeries wandering around in europe ,COMMA which is an astonishing number .PERIOD when you think that surgery must have been a last resort .PERIOD joseph lister was aepsis's or sterility's ,COMMA biggest advocate to a very ,COMMA very skeptical bunch of surgeons .PERIOD the mayo brothers came out to visit lister in europe ,COMMA something so simple laparoscopy is doing this kind of surgery surgery ,COMMA with long instruments through small incisions .PERIOD but there were casualties of this revolution .PERIOD they had to give up their wrists .PERIOD they had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments .PERIOD now what you put between those instruments and those hands is a large fairly complicated robot .PERIOD and since this was introduced in 1999 ,COMMA a lot of these robots have been out and being used for surgical procedures like a prostatectomy ,COMMA which is a prostate deep in the pelvis .PERIOD and it requires fine dissection and delicate manipulation to be able to get a good surgical outcome ,COMMA more useful than a solid gold surgeon .PERIOD but still ,COMMA it's a fairly big capital investment .PERIOD it has to be able to come off of the centerline ,COMMA and then be able to work back toward that centerline .PERIOD it's not so simple for the patient .PERIOD however ,COMMA it's transparent ,COMMA this is all they're going to see .PERIOD it's very exciting to think where we get to go with this as we take these capabilities .PERIOD and we get to go to the next places .PERIOD we get to decide what our new surgeries are going to be .PERIOD and i think to really get the rest of the way in that revolution ,COMMA we need to not just take our hands in in new ways .PERIOD we also need to take our eyes in in new ways we need to see beyond the surface .PERIOD you know ,COMMA for me ,COMMA the interest in contemporary forms of slavery started with a leaflet that i picked up in london .PERIOD and i'm going to admit to hubris ,COMMA it was mind-blowing .PERIOD but in fact ,COMMA that kind of bluey color are the countries where we can't find any cases of slavery .PERIOD well ,COMMA it builds up with these factors .PERIOD add in the increased vulnerability of very large numbers of people in the developing world ,COMMA caused by civil wars ,COMMA ethnic conflicts ,COMMA kleptocratic governments disease ,COMMA you name it ,COMMA you know it .PERIOD but if corruption creeps in and people don't have the opportunity to have that protection of the rule of law .PERIOD then if you can use violence ,COMMA if you can use violence with impunity ,COMMA you can reach out and harvest the vulnerable into slavery .PERIOD all around the world .PERIOD i've been told an almost identical story .PERIOD they said that guy looked sketchy .PERIOD i was suspicious ,COMMA but my children were hungry .PERIOD we needed medicine .PERIOD ten miles 100 miles 1000 miles later .PERIOD they find themselves in dirty dangerous demeaning work ,COMMA africans and indians as usual .PERIOD south americans and eastern europeans in particular are on our buy list .PERIOD d ,COMMA interesting ,COMMA micheal ,COMMA bottom line .PERIOD what do you recommend ?QUESTIONMARK kevin bales :COLON okay ,COMMA you figured it out .PERIOD that's a spoof slaves ,COMMA cost between 3000 to 8000 dollars in north america .PERIOD but i could take you places in india or nepal ,COMMA where human beings can be acquired for five or 10 dollars .PERIOD they key here is that people have ceased to be that capital purchase item and become like styrofoam cups .PERIOD you buy them cheaply ,COMMA you use them ,COMMA you crumple them up .PERIOD and then when you're done with them ,COMMA you just throw them away .PERIOD i've got to say ,COMMA one of the most exciting parts about my job is that i get to .PERIOD and i want to introduce you to one of those .PERIOD this is not james .PERIOD this is one of the kids that he works with ,COMMA and it can be done liberation .PERIOD and more importantly ,COMMA all the work that comes after liberation .PERIOD this is what liberation really looks like .PERIOD she said ,COMMA no ,COMMA because we've got hope now .PERIOD okay .PERIOD thank you so much ,COMMA despite the new york times' and vanity ,COMMA fair's best efforts .PERIOD recently ,COMMA they're not brothers .PERIOD this is actually a training film for a clown college that they had .PERIOD there is a picture of charles .PERIOD so let's watch the next clip ,COMMA but people live on this land .PERIOD so what we're going to see is some of the icons of eames furniture .PERIOD and i'm really here to talk about design .PERIOD and this is a little film i made about the making of the eames lounge chair ,COMMA because it just kind of ,COMMA you know ,COMMA doesn't get any more basic than that .PERIOD this is a relatively famous chair .PERIOD but doing these splints ,COMMA they learned a lot about the manufacturing process ,COMMA which was incredibly important to them .PERIOD i'm trying to show you too much ,COMMA because i want you to really get a broth of ideas and images .PERIOD this is a house that charles and ray designed .PERIOD my sister is chasing someone else .PERIOD it's not me ,COMMA although i endorse heartily the fact that he stole her diary .PERIOD it's not me the house is 1949 .PERIOD and now i'm going to test you .PERIOD i hope you had a nice time at buddy's party ,COMMA and they honor events in the linear world from the fictional world .PERIOD and then embassy row is actually a historical site ,COMMA because in the kymaerican story ,COMMA this is where the parisian diaspora started where there embassy was .PERIOD and the town has really embraced it ,COMMA and you're kind of trapped in the texture of kymaerica .PERIOD and this is cranbrook .PERIOD i've got a real treat for you ,COMMA which is the first film that charles ever made .PERIOD and he made it for the 1939 ,COMMA faculty exhibition .PERIOD you want to learn how to make films go make a movie .PERIOD so my point is that this scope of vision ,COMMA this holistic vision of design was with them from the beginning .PERIOD it wasn't like ,COMMA oh ,COMMA we made some chairs and got successful .PERIOD so we're going to do the last clip and part of why this stuff is important .PERIOD and all the things that we do are important is that these are the ideas we need and working on the idea that the cheapest electric toaster would also be the simplest to reverse-engineer .PERIOD i went and bought the cheapest toaster .PERIOD i could find took it home and was kind of dismayed to discover that inside this object ,COMMA which i'd bought for just 349 pounds .PERIOD there were 400 different bits ,COMMA made out of a hundred-plus different materials .PERIOD can i come up and get some iron ?QUESTIONMARK but after some nagging ,COMMA i got him to do that .PERIOD but instead of a bellows ,COMMA i had a leaf blower .PERIOD plastic is the defining feature of cheap electrical goods .PERIOD and you can actually make plastic from obviously oils ,COMMA which come from plants ,COMMA but also from starches .PERIOD so this is attempting to make potato starch plastic .PERIOD and it was looking good for a while ,COMMA but i left it outside because you had to leave it outside to dry .PERIOD and unfortunately ,COMMA i came back and there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato .PERIOD so kind of out of desperation ,COMMA i decided that i could think laterally and there it is on the shelves .PERIOD i don't know if you could see ,COMMA but i was never able to make insulation for the wires .PERIOD they were trying to catch fish .PERIOD however ,COMMA the report focused on what had already occurred and offered no information on what to expect .PERIOD now voice 1 .PERIOD it's coming again .PERIOD voice 2 ,COMMA new wave .PERIOD you know ,COMMA if you think about something like google ,COMMA which essentially is relying on the collective intelligence of the web to seek out those sites that have the most valuable information -- .PERIOD we know that google does an exceptionally good job of doing that .PERIOD and it does that ,COMMA because collectively ,COMMA this disorganized thing we call the world wide web actually has a remarkable order ,COMMA or a remarkable intelligence in it .PERIOD but what the blogosphere offers is the possibility of getting at the kind of collective distributive intelligence that is out there ,COMMA and that we know is available to us if we can just figure out a way of accessing it .PERIOD a network is not just the product of its component parts .PERIOD it is something more than that .PERIOD and that phenomenon of piling on the existing links is one that is characteristic of the blogosphere ,COMMA particularly of the political blogosphere .PERIOD and it is one that essentially throws off this beautiful decentralized ,COMMA bottom-up intelligence that blogs can manifest in the right conditions .PERIOD when we talk about bottom-up decentralized phenomena .PERIOD the ant colony is the classic metaphor because no individual ant knows what it's doing .PERIOD but collectively ,COMMA ants are able to reach incredibly intelligent decisions .PERIOD but the pace of exponential growth is really what describes information technologies .PERIOD it makes a huge difference .PERIOD and moore's law was not the first paradigm to bring exponential growth to computing .PERIOD when that comes to an end ,COMMA we'll go to the sixth paradigm ,COMMA three-dimensional ,COMMA self-organizing molecular circuits ,COMMA the great depression made not a dent in this exponential progression .PERIOD and i was asked ,COMMA well ,COMMA aren't you nervous and the cost of a transistor cycle ,COMMA which is a measure of the price performance of electronics comes down about every year .PERIOD but that was really right on schedule .PERIOD communication technologies ,COMMA 50 different ways to measure this .PERIOD the number of bits being moved around the size of the internet .PERIOD some critics say ,COMMA oh well ,COMMA software is stuck in the mud when i was a student ,COMMA it was across campus .PERIOD now ,COMMA it's in our pockets ,COMMA all the intellectual property that is created and taught will be online and available and developed online in a collaborative fashion .PERIOD here is our founding meeting .PERIOD so we're very appreciative of the support we've gotten from both the intellectual leaders .PERIOD the high-tech leaders particularly google and nasa whole arm shoulder ,COMMA disarticulation ,COMMA not in an envelope of a human arm ,COMMA with 21 degrees of freedom from your shoulder to your fingertips .PERIOD you think it's bad to lose one arm .PERIOD we have 14 out of the 21 degrees of freedom .PERIOD you don't need the ones in the last two fingers a couple of weeks ago .PERIOD we took it down to walter reed ,COMMA which is unfortunately more in the news ,COMMA these days ,COMMA it's going to go inside something that we use in cat scans .PERIOD and mris of whatever is their good arm to make silicon rubber ,COMMA then coat it and paint it in 3d ,COMMA -- ,COMMA exact mirror image of their other limb .PERIOD this weighs 69 pounds .PERIOD now he's going to pick up a pen with his opposed thumb and index finger .PERIOD that's about 10 percent of our global needs and 100 percent of some island nations .PERIOD it all began when two scientists ,COMMA fred grassle and jesse ausubel met in woods hole ,COMMA massachusetts ,COMMA where both were guests at the famed oceanographic institute .PERIOD they ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA are an endangered species themselves .PERIOD so fishermen could only catch what they could either eat or sell that day .PERIOD but this is no laughing matter .PERIOD that's the sort of technology that's available today that really wasn't available even a decade ago .PERIOD and so for animals that come to the surface to breathe ,COMMA such as this elephant seal ,COMMA it's an opportunity to send data back to shore and tell us where exactly it is in the ocean .PERIOD for example ,COMMA the dark blue shows you where the elephant seal moved in the north pacific for animals that don't surface .PERIOD we have something called pop-up tags ,COMMA which collect data about light .PERIOD and what time the sun rises and sets geneticists have developed a similar tool called genetic barcoding .PERIOD and so they put this together a list of all the species where they're known to occur .PERIOD and it really seemed like a very esoteric scientific type of exercise .PERIOD so all of a sudden ,COMMA this labor of love for no obvious .PERIOD economic reason has become a critical piece of information in terms of how that system is going to recover how long it will take and how the lawsuits and the multi-billion-dollar discussions that are going to happen in the coming years are likely to be resolved .PERIOD you can do this on a global scale ,COMMA but you can also do it on a regional scale .PERIOD now ,COMMA while a lot of the species ,COMMA we discovered in the census are things that are small and hard to see that certainly wasn't always the case .PERIOD similarly ,COMMA this golden v kelp collected in alaska ,COMMA just below the low water .PERIOD mark is probably a new species .PERIOD this particular shrimp .PERIOD we've dubbed it the jurassic shrimp .PERIOD it's thought to have gone extinct 50 years ago ,COMMA -- ,COMMA at least it was until the census discovered it was living and doing just fine off the coast of australia .PERIOD now ,COMMA this little critter it's only about half a millimeter in size ,COMMA not terribly charismatic .PERIOD and we also found this spectacular yeti crab that lives near boiling hot hydrothermal vents at easter island .PERIOD that means 91 percent ,COMMA even after the census still remain to be discovered .PERIOD but the really intriguing thing about the microbes is just how diverse they are .PERIOD a single drop of seawater could contain 160 different types of microbes .PERIOD the other point i'd like to make about this is that this ocean's interconnected census scientists worked in the rain .PERIOD they worked in the cold .PERIOD they worked under water ,COMMA and they worked above water ,COMMA trying to illuminate the wondrous discovery .PERIOD the still vast unknown the spectacular adaptations that we see in ocean life .PERIOD so whether you're a yak herder living in the mountains of chile ,COMMA whether you're a stockbroker in new york city ,COMMA or whether you're a tedster living in edinburgh ,COMMA the oceans matter .PERIOD ♫ i could show the world how to smile ♫ ♫ i could be glad all of the while .PERIOD ♫ ♫ i could turn the gray skies to blue ,COMMA if i had you ♫ ♫ i could leave the old days behind ♫ ♫ leave all my pals i’d never mind .PERIOD ♫ ♫ i could start my life all anew if i had you .PERIOD ♫ ♫ i could climb the snow-capped mountains .PERIOD ♫ ♫ sail ,COMMA the mighty ocean wide ♫ ♫ i could cross the burning desert .PERIOD if i had you by my side ♫ ♫ i could be a king ,COMMA dear uncrowned ,COMMA humble or poor ,COMMA rich ,COMMA or renowned .PERIOD ♫ ♫ there is nothing ,COMMA i couldn’t do if i had you ♫ thank you .PERIOD well ,COMMA thank you so much .PERIOD and there's a cause for that all right .PERIOD well ,COMMA it's been around for 2500 years ,COMMA and we do something different than what we did in the past .PERIOD we add kind of a modicum of intelligence to that ,COMMA if there are 15 operations ,COMMA you know that none of them work .PERIOD you've heard that word several times in the last four days ,COMMA and everyone's familiar with kuhnian paradigms .PERIOD and by the human spirit ,COMMA i don't mean anything divine .PERIOD i don't mean anything supernatural -- certainly not coming from this skeptic .PERIOD what i mean is this ability that each of us has to be something greater than herself ,COMMA or himself to arise out of our ordinary selves and achieve something that at the beginning .PERIOD we thought ,COMMA perhaps we were not capable of there has certainly been no argument about that in this room in the past four days .PERIOD so if we are to be the world's healer ,COMMA every disadvantaged person in this world -- ,COMMA including in the united states ,COMMA -- becomes our patient .PERIOD i would like to quote one of my own household gods .PERIOD think about it .PERIOD rudimentary animal has a nervous system swims around in the ocean in its juvenile life .PERIOD if you put a five year-old child's dexterity against the best robots of today ,COMMA the answer is simple .PERIOD the child wins easily when it comes to being dexterous .PERIOD it's not even clear what the algorithm is you have to solve to be dexterous .PERIOD but let me show you cutting-edge robotics .PERIOD now ,COMMA the americans in the audience will know all about cup stacking .PERIOD and it sounds like an easy problem .PERIOD so ,COMMA the old days before digital radio ,COMMA when you were tuning in your radio ,COMMA and you heard crrcckkk on the station ,COMMA you wanted to hear that was the noise .PERIOD so if you're lucky enough to be able to knock a small white ball into a hole ,COMMA several hundred yards away ,COMMA using a long metal ,COMMA stick our society will be willing to reward you with hundreds of millions of dollars .PERIOD but we're going to represent beliefs with probabilities ,COMMA but there's another source of information .PERIOD and that's effectively prior knowledge .PERIOD but you know that your senses are not perfect .PERIOD and therefore ,COMMA there's some variability of where it's going to land shown by that cloud of red ,COMMA representing numbers between 05 and maybe 01 that information is available in the current shot .PERIOD but there's another source of information ,COMMA not available on the current shot ,COMMA but only available by repeated experience in the game of tennis .PERIOD and that's that the ball doesn't bounce with equal probability over the court .PERIOD during the match .PERIOD as we go around .PERIOD we learn about statistics of the world and lay that down .PERIOD but we also learn about how noisy our own sensory apparatus is .PERIOD and then combine those in a real bayesian way .PERIOD so that really means i have to make predictions of the future .PERIOD any discrepancy should hopefully be external .PERIOD so as i go around the world ,COMMA i'm making predictions of what i should get subtracting them off .PERIOD and we replay that to the other hand with a time delay .PERIOD and based on this illustration ,COMMA we really convinced ourselves in the field that the brain's making precise predictions and subtracting them off from the sensations .PERIOD so we were looking for a much more objective way to assess this phenomena .PERIOD so if they retaliate with the same force ,COMMA the first person will think it's been escalated .PERIOD now we don't work with children .PERIOD we don't work with hitting ,COMMA but the concept is identical .PERIOD we started with a motor with a little lever ,COMMA a little force transfuser .PERIOD so it re-shows ,COMMA the brain makes predictions ,COMMA and fundamentally changes the precepts .PERIOD but we've got a problem ,COMMA and there's a big gap between the task and the movement system .PERIOD i could choose these two paths out of an infinite number of paths .PERIOD maybe we don't all quite move the same way ,COMMA but there's noise added to this .PERIOD so if i pick the same command through many times ,COMMA i will get a different noisy version each time because noise changes each time .PERIOD and the fundamental idea is ,COMMA you want to plan your movements ,COMMA so as to minimize the negative consequence of the noise .PERIOD so you want to avoid big forces as one principle .PERIOD so we've shown that using this .PERIOD we can explain a huge amount of data -- that exactly people are going about their lives planning movements .PERIOD so as to minimize negative consequences of noise ,COMMA all the conversation stopped ,COMMA all the eyes turned to me .PERIOD and so what i'd like to do now is to tell you about what we've learned in those journeys .PERIOD they put smart skylights through their stores ,COMMA so they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands .PERIOD so let me tell you this ,COMMA when wal-mart achieves 20 percent energy reductions that's going to be a very big deal ,COMMA but i'm afraid it's not enough .PERIOD well ,COMMA bob said ,COMMA the most important thing we could do right now is to make it clear in sacramento california that we need a market-based system of mandates that's going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in california .PERIOD here's a story about national policy that we could all learn from .PERIOD they'd run ethanol or ordinary gasoline .PERIOD so what's happened in brazil is they've replaced 40 percent of the gasoline consumed by their automotive fleet with ethanol .PERIOD so a team of berkeley ,COMMA researchers with 15 million dollars from the gates foundation is engineering ,COMMA designing a radical new way to make the key ingredient called artemisinin .PERIOD and they're going to make that drug 10 times cheaper .PERIOD well ,COMMA i'll tell you -- a lot .PERIOD second fact ,COMMA the president's new budget for renewable energy is barely a billion dollars .PERIOD in total third fact ,COMMA i bet you didn't know that there's enough energy in hot rocks under the country to supply america's energy needs for the next thousand years .PERIOD and the federal budget calls for a measly 20 million dollars of r&ampd in geothermal energy ,COMMA not enough to stabilize the climate ,COMMA not enough to keep the ice in greenland from crashing into the ocean .PERIOD we've got to make this economic so that all people and all nations make the right outcome ,COMMA the profitable outcome ,COMMA and therefore the likely outcome .PERIOD it is the mother of all markets .PERIOD you remember that internet .PERIOD she's like oh us .PERIOD i'm like ,COMMA okay ,COMMA all right .PERIOD that's cool .PERIOD and there's a dude selling these aftermarket weapons for lego because lego -- ,COMMA the danish -- ,COMMA no ,COMMA they're not into guns .PERIOD but the americans ,COMMA oh ,COMMA we'll make some guns for lego .PERIOD no problem .PERIOD and at a certain point you look around ,COMMA you're like ,COMMA whoa .PERIOD this is a really nerdy crowd .PERIOD i'm kind of into this stuff ,COMMA and i'm going to stop being embarrassed .PERIOD and so this is like this cad program where you build it .PERIOD i have to take a moment .PERIOD there's a whole gray market for lego thousands of home-based businesses .PERIOD let's see here .PERIOD that's 300 million years per minute .PERIOD so this is frozen water .PERIOD the most intriguing and puzzling measurement in my opinion .PERIOD we've obtained of mars was released earlier this year in the magazine ,COMMA science .PERIOD and what we're looking at is the presence of the gas ,COMMA methane ch4 in the atmosphere of mars .PERIOD that's because the northern hemisphere is the region of the ancient ocean basin .PERIOD and that's because the water protected the basin from being impacted by asteroids and meteorites .PERIOD here's hellas basin ,COMMA a very ,COMMA very different place .PERIOD geologically .PERIOD we addressed on the board ,COMMA the major questions that have not been answered .PERIOD and the result of our meeting was a robotic rocket-powered airplane .PERIOD we call ares .PERIOD and our goal is to inspire the american public who is paying for this mission through tax dollars .PERIOD how do we transport an airplane to mars ?QUESTIONMARK and we have it in something called an aeroshell ,COMMA because we have tested ares model .PERIOD several models in a half ,COMMA a dozen wind tunnels at the nasa langley research center for eight years ,COMMA under mars conditions .PERIOD we're ready to go .PERIOD this is the ares team .PERIOD we have about 150 scientists engineers ,COMMA where we're working with jet propulsion laboratory goddard space flight center ames ,COMMA research center and half a dozen major universities and corporations in developing this .PERIOD thank you very much .PERIOD and my colleague ,COMMA james fowler and i have been studying for quite sometime what are the mathematical social ,COMMA biological and psychological rules that govern how these networks are assembled .PERIOD and what are the similar rules that govern how they operate ,COMMA how they affect our lives ?QUESTIONMARK they actually diffuse through networks .PERIOD you could have friendship relationships ,COMMA sibling relationships ,COMMA spousal relationships :COLON co-worker relationships ,COMMA neighbor ,COMMA relationships .PERIOD and the like or their altruistic or their charitable ,COMMA giving behavior might be influenced by their coworkers ,COMMA or by their neighbors .PERIOD nicholas christakis b ,COMMA it's obvious .PERIOD and what we show here is -- like here ,COMMA -- very few .PERIOD people are affected more and more and more and up to here .PERIOD and here's the peak of the epidemic .PERIOD and if they nominate the party host ,COMMA as their friend ,COMMA that party host has a hundred friends ,COMMA therefore has more friends than they do .PERIOD so we thought we would exploit this idea in order to study whether we could predict phenomena within networks .PERIOD and also ,COMMA we had them [actively] email us a couple of times a week .PERIOD by monitoring ,COMMA the friends group we could get 16 days advance warning of an impending epidemic in this human population .PERIOD now ,COMMA in our case ,COMMA although it wasn't necessary ,COMMA we could also actually map the network of the students we're going to take daily cuts through the network for 120 days .PERIOD every dot is a person .PERIOD and every line represents a volume of calls between the people .PERIOD and in fact ,COMMA we are in the era of what i would call massive-passive data collection efforts .PERIOD they're all kinds of ways we can use massively collected data to create sensor networks to follow the population understand what's happening in the population and intervene in the population for the better .PERIOD one is quasi-active ,COMMA like the flu example .PERIOD i gave where we get some people to nominate their friends ,COMMA and then passively monitor their friends -- .PERIOD do they have the flu or not -- ,COMMA and then get warning .PERIOD they collect millions of points at a time with very high accuracy and very high resolution .PERIOD they were gone in an instant .PERIOD the royal tombs had been destroyed by suspected arson .PERIOD let me leave you with a final thought .PERIOD and that was that an american congresswoman named patricia schroeder from colorado met with a group of journalists .PERIOD it will refer you directly to your congressperson to your us senator to your governor where divestment legislation is pending .PERIOD for instance ,COMMA the referral of the crimes in darfur to the international criminal court ,COMMA which the bush administration doesn't like he moved with the headlines ,COMMA but uh-oh ,COMMA the killers are within the camps .PERIOD well ,COMMA if you denounce ,COMMA you're probably never going to get back in the room .PERIOD you're un-owned .PERIOD he started as somebody who would denounce harmdoers .PERIOD he would charge up to people who were violating international law ,COMMA and he would say you're violating .PERIOD this is the un charter ,COMMA all the great progress in this country with relation to our adversaries has come by going into the room .PERIOD there's going to be a lot of people .PERIOD but it never struck me as it did that moment ,COMMA because on that image was a woman trying to nurse her baby .PERIOD and she had no milk to nurse a hundred years ago .PERIOD we didn't at our time in history .PERIOD these images are out of place .PERIOD this is more than hiv/aids malaria and tuberculosis combined .PERIOD and here you see a brain scan of two children ,COMMA -- one ,COMMA who had adequate nutrition ,COMMA another neglected and who was deeply malnourished .PERIOD and so today we focus on not just passing out food ,COMMA but making sure the mothers have enough enrichment and teaching them about breastfeeding .PERIOD it doesn't need to be refrigerated .PERIOD it doesn't need water ,COMMA which is often lacking .PERIOD eighty percent of the people in the world have no food safety net ,COMMA and usually the institutions -- churches ,COMMA temples other things .PERIOD -- do not have the resources to provide a safety net .PERIOD and if you fill the cup with local agriculture from small farmers ,COMMA you have a transformative effect .PERIOD many kids in the world can't go to school because they have to go beg and find a meal .PERIOD it costs less than 25 cents a day to change a kid's life .PERIOD families need the help .PERIOD so is this a hopeless cause cameroon ,COMMA northern cameroon ,COMMA boom and bust cycles of hunger ,COMMA every year for decades ,COMMA food aid coming in every year ,COMMA when people are starving during the lean seasons ,COMMA you manage the village manages these warehouses and the food banks are growing .PERIOD we're seeing that now ,COMMA in the horn of africa ,COMMA where food prices are up 240 percent in some areas over last year ,COMMA the shopkeepers are hiring more people .PERIOD and they require that a third of that food come from the smallest farmers ,COMMA who would have no opportunity ?QUESTIONMARK i've gone out there .PERIOD i've met with the small farmers who have built their livelihoods on the opportunity and platform provided by this .PERIOD you look at the cost-benefit analysis .PERIOD and my dream is to take this issue ,COMMA not just from the compassion argument ,COMMA but to the finance ministers of the world and say ,COMMA we cannot afford to not invest in the access to adequate affordable nutrition for all of humanity .PERIOD when a leader says ,COMMA not under my watch ,COMMA everything begins to change wfp's been able to leave 30 nations ,COMMA because they have transformed the face of hunger in their nations .PERIOD not only that transforming hunger is an opportunity .PERIOD but i think we have to change our mindsets .PERIOD what's exciting is that over the last two or three years ,COMMA the government has spent 400 million dollars ,COMMA and they've allocated another billion dollars to what we call the cancer genome atlas project .PERIOD the cancer genome atlas is coming out .PERIOD now ,COMMA there's also a field of proteomics that i'll talk about in a few minutes ,COMMA which i think is going to be the next level in terms of understanding and classifying disease .PERIOD cancer is an interaction of a cell that no longer is under growth control with the environment .PERIOD the goal of me as a cancer doctor is not to understand cancer .PERIOD you know ,COMMA if i measured your temperature over 30 days ,COMMA and i asked ,COMMA what was the average temperature ?QUESTIONMARK i mean ,COMMA this is a scary slide ,COMMA not to take an aside ,COMMA but it looks at obesity in the world .PERIOD so our systems today are dramatically different than our systems ,COMMA a decade or two ago .PERIOD that is the most effective cost-effective best way we can do things .PERIOD today .PERIOD sounds are affecting your hormone secretions all the time ,COMMA but also your breathing ,COMMA your heart rate -- ,COMMA which i just also did -- .PERIOD and your brainwaves ,COMMA it has the frequency of roughly 12 cycles per minute .PERIOD there are eight expressions of a brand in sound .PERIOD you all recognize that one .PERIOD this is the most-played tune in the world today .PERIOD why are we doing this ?QUESTIONMARK the first is it's essential for us to understand the human brain .PERIOD if we do want to get along in society .PERIOD and i think that it is a key step in evolution .PERIOD and you may think that anesthetics work by sending you into some deep sleep ,COMMA or by blocking your receptors ,COMMA so that you don't feel pain .PERIOD but in fact ,COMMA most anesthetics don't work that way .PERIOD 99 percent of what you see is not what comes in through the eyes .PERIOD they are highly reactive ,COMMA and they are super-plastic .PERIOD and so the autists are probably capable of building and learning a symphony ,COMMA which is unthinkable for us .PERIOD they choose very carefully who they connect with .PERIOD and we did that for tens of thousands of neurons ,COMMA built digital models of all the different types of neurons .PERIOD we came across ,COMMA and we think this is species-specific ,COMMA which means that that could explain why we can't communicate across species .PERIOD so let's switch it on .PERIOD but to do it ,COMMA what you have to do is you have to make this come alive .PERIOD there literally are only a handful of equations that you need to simulate the activity of the neocortex .PERIOD here we activate it .PERIOD and this gives the first glimpse of what is happening in your brain .PERIOD when there is a stimulation .PERIOD we can ask ,COMMA where is it inside if we stimulate it with a picture ?QUESTIONMARK fifty years ago ,COMMA when i began exploring the ocean ,COMMA no one -- ,COMMA not jacques perrin ,COMMA not jacques cousteau ,COMMA or rachel carson ,COMMA -- imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it ,COMMA or by what we took out of it .PERIOD i want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us ,COMMA and to consider why it matters that in 50 years ,COMMA we've lost -- .PERIOD actually ,COMMA we've taken .PERIOD we've eaten -- more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea .PERIOD why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared .PERIOD why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the pacific should concern not only the creatures that are dying .PERIOD but it really should concern you .PERIOD i'm haunted by the thought of what ray anderson calls .PERIOD tomorrow's child asking why we didn't do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean .PERIOD while there still was time for me as a scientist .PERIOD it all began in 1953 .PERIOD when i first tried scuba since then ,COMMA i've used about 30 kinds of submarines .PERIOD and i've started three companies ,COMMA and a nonprofit foundation called deep search to design and build systems to access the deep sea .PERIOD and i'm living proof ,COMMA no matter where on earth .PERIOD you live over time .PERIOD most of the planet's organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there ,COMMA mostly by microbes you did a great job with the land ,COMMA the dirt .PERIOD we need new deep-diving submarines .PERIOD that's bad news for us too .PERIOD we're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other trash into the sea millions of tons of discarded fishing nets .PERIOD gear that continues to kill .PERIOD we're still killing bluefin tuna ,COMMA truly endangered and much more valuable alive than dead using google earth .PERIOD you can witness trawlers -- in china ,COMMA the north sea ,COMMA the gulf of mexico ,COMMA -- shaking ,COMMA the foundation of our life support system leaving plumes of death in their path together .PERIOD we had just broken the world speed record for a trek to the south pole .PERIOD now ,COMMA many of you are probably saying ,COMMA wait a sec is this tough to do you'll be in a massive headwind ,COMMA virtually none all of our equipment ,COMMA including film equipment was charged by the sun .PERIOD look at that central building right in the middle of the picture .PERIOD that's the 130-foot diameter library that is exactly the size of the base of the spaceship .PERIOD two days later ,COMMA the space traveler's manifesto explaining why -- just like we heard yesterday -- why we need to go into space trips to satellites of the outer planets ,COMMA august 20 1958 .PERIOD and that's why when you get something declassified .PERIOD that's what it looks like .PERIOD this is ed day putting .PERIOD so each of these coffee cans has three pounds of c4 in it .PERIOD so thanks to him .PERIOD and now we have ground hazard assessments when you have a blow-up on the pad .PERIOD this is the kind of stuff that's not been declassified ,COMMA just that people managed to sneak home .PERIOD and after ,COMMA you know ,COMMA on their deathbed ,COMMA basically gave me .PERIOD and one part of nasa was interested in it .PERIOD but the headquarters in nasa ,COMMA they killed the project .PERIOD so finally ,COMMA at the end ,COMMA we can see the thing followed its sort of design path ,COMMA right up to 1965 .PERIOD and then all those paths came to a halt .PERIOD and it turned out to be quite fun in two ways .PERIOD and to the extent ,COMMA you believe i didn't shrink the lines ,COMMA which i didn't .PERIOD i've proven to you that your eyes were deceiving .PERIOD you right ?QUESTIONMARK it's impossible to overcome .PERIOD this sense that this is indeed longer turns out that they got to 28 percent after mailing every household in the country ,COMMA a letter ,COMMA begging people to join this organ donation program ,COMMA when you walk into the dmv ,COMMA the person who designed the form will have a huge influence on what you'll end up doing .PERIOD what do you do ?QUESTIONMARK do you pull the patient back and try ibuprofen ?QUESTIONMARK the other group of the physicians they said yesterday ,COMMA when you reviewed the case you discovered there were two medications .PERIOD you didn't try out yet ibuprofen and piroxicam .PERIOD now think of it .PERIOD this decision makes it as easy to let the patient continue with hip replacement .PERIOD the thing is is that no physician would ever say ,COMMA piroxicam ibuprofen .PERIOD hip replacement an online subscription for 59 dollars .PERIOD these are the market share .PERIOD most people wanted the combo deal .PERIOD the answer was absolutely yes .PERIOD now you're getting it .PERIOD and we also have more than five billion of these devices here .PERIOD these 14 million cellular radio masts or base stations ,COMMA consume a lot of energy .PERIOD and that creates a big problem .PERIOD it's good for a nice suntan ,COMMA but otherwise dangerous for the human body ,COMMA and multiply that by 10000 ,COMMA then you end up at 14 billion not usable for a youtube video .PERIOD and the light goes through that hole .PERIOD and that signal is then converted back to a high-speed data stream ,COMMA and not only integrate a photo detector here ,COMMA but maybe use the camera inside .PERIOD so what happens when i switch on that light ?QUESTIONMARK but at the same time ,COMMA you see this video coming up here .PERIOD so no one ,COMMA if i have a light here ,COMMA if i have secure data ,COMMA no one on the other side of this room ,COMMA through that wall would be able to read that data .PERIOD so ,COMMA for me ,COMMA the applications of it to me are beyond imagination at the moment .PERIOD and they use light to illuminate space down there .PERIOD if you saw 2001 a space odyssey and you heard the boom ,COMMA boom ,COMMA boom ,COMMA boom .PERIOD and you saw the monolith ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that was arthur c ,COMMA clarke's representation that we were at a seminal moment in the evolution of our species .PERIOD and you know ,COMMA we in the last 30 years in particular have seen this acceleration in knowledge and technology ,COMMA and technology has bred more knowledge and given us tools .PERIOD and we've seen many seminal moments ,COMMA you're walking around .PERIOD your car has 12 microprocessors .PERIOD then we go along and create the internet and connect the world together .PERIOD we flatten the world .PERIOD the dna is organized in words ,COMMA call them genes and chromosomes .PERIOD dna is a very elegant molecule .PERIOD this here is a bug in my genome that i have struggled with for a long long time .PERIOD what is the code ?QUESTIONMARK then you can go about the process of trying to fix it and figure it out for my wife ,COMMA eat three times as much .PERIOD and you never put on any weight .PERIOD it's all hidden in this code .PERIOD and it's starting to be understood at breakneck pace .PERIOD we can understand ,COMMA for example ,COMMA why we create plaque in our arteries ,COMMA what creates the starchiness inside of a grain ?QUESTIONMARK why does yeast metabolize sugar and produce carbon dioxide ?QUESTIONMARK we can also look at at a grander scale ,COMMA what creates problems ,COMMA what creates disease and how we may be able to fix them .PERIOD now you have the genome ,COMMA and you say to yourself .PERIOD so if i plug this synthetic genome -- ,COMMA if i pull the old one out and plug it in -- ,COMMA does it just boot up and live ?QUESTIONMARK and this is extremely profound .PERIOD so then what do you do ?QUESTIONMARK we can start to figure that out ,COMMA and he had the best answer .PERIOD i ever heard to this question .PERIOD well ,COMMA somebody has to you cannot compete with the environment .PERIOD if you have an adolescent dog's brain go on something should happen .PERIOD now .PERIOD no ,COMMA we go puppy ,COMMA sit -- ,COMMA boom .PERIOD it's got it in six to 10 trials .PERIOD he'll find jamie wherever he is ,COMMA you know ,COMMA wherever kids are crushing rocks by a stream or something and take him a little message that says ,COMMA hey dinner's ,COMMA ready ,COMMA come in for dinner .PERIOD so at this point ,COMMA the dog knows what we want it to do the dog lives with you .PERIOD the dog can get you any time .PERIOD so the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want to do what we want him to do .PERIOD and this is very easy .PERIOD and what we're doing in essence is we're teaching the dog kind of like -- .PERIOD we're letting the dog think that the dog is training us .PERIOD and now ,COMMA the dog's really happy .PERIOD there's several definitions of what a punishment is .PERIOD but one definition ,COMMA the most popular is a punishment is a stimulus that reduces the immediately preceding behavior such that it's less likely to occur in the future .PERIOD the dog is actually euthanized now .PERIOD but this was a dog i worked with for a while ,COMMA when the dog would try to leave the mat ,COMMA she would say rover on the mat on the mat on the mat ,COMMA how are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear rover ?QUESTIONMARK come here .PERIOD rover .PERIOD come here .PERIOD you son of a bitch .PERIOD and i went ,COMMA oh my god ,COMMA do i do something ?QUESTIONMARK the husband won't clear up his clothes ,COMMA or the wife's always late for meetings .PERIOD whatever it is ,COMMA ok ,COMMA you see it ,COMMA especially in the workplace ,COMMA especially from boss to employee .PERIOD and this ,COMMA i would say ,COMMA is the biggest human foible that we have your kids are easy to train .PERIOD we think how we do it -- .PERIOD one night in bed ,COMMA we're pregnant .PERIOD and then we're raising the most important thing in life ,COMMA a child .PERIOD and it concludes in something that you see here that you actually wouldn't expect as being the result of rationality .PERIOD i call it sort of shotgun flexibility .PERIOD so what you're seeing now is actually the design of the building .PERIOD so that was the core idea .PERIOD so once we had presented that back to them ,COMMA they agreed that .PERIOD this sort of core concept could work the things on the -- .PERIOD on the left-hand side of the diagram ,COMMA those are the boxes that skin serves double duty again for economics .PERIOD so it's an unusual building for a public library .PERIOD obviously ,COMMA that was the main sort of technology area in the building .PERIOD you dizzy yet ,COMMA and it allowed us to go back to first principles and redefine fly tower ,COMMA acoustic enclosure ,COMMA light enclosure and so forth .PERIOD they came to us ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA -- ,COMMA unlike normal ,COMMA developers ,COMMA -- ,COMMA they said ,COMMA we want to start out by providing a contemporary art museum in louisville .PERIOD that's our main goal .PERIOD and so instead of being a developer ,COMMA that sees an opportunity to make money ,COMMA they saw an ability to be a catalyst in their downtown .PERIOD and that pro forma led us to a mixed-use building that was very large in order to support their aspirations of the art .PERIOD but it also opened up opportunities for the art itself to collaborate interact with commercial spaces that actually artists more and more want to work within .PERIOD and there is a pedestrian corridor that they wanted to add that would link a series of cultural buildings ,COMMA and a view corridor -- ,COMMA because this is the historic district -- that they didn't want to obstruct with the new building .PERIOD it also means that if an artist wants to invade something like a swimming pool ,COMMA they can begin to do their exhibition in a swimming pool .PERIOD so they're not forced to always work within the confines of a contemporary gallery space .PERIOD ok ,COMMA now ,COMMA you're 19 now .PERIOD and i tried and i made it ,COMMA and you made it out of what and so and that windmill ,COMMA what -- it worked ?QUESTIONMARK yeah .PERIOD so ,COMMA what did they make of -- that you were 14 15 at the time -- ?QUESTIONMARK what did they make of this ?QUESTIONMARK they were impressed .PERIOD yeah .PERIOD so that would produce irrigation for the entire village ,COMMA because it gets into all sorts of crazy realms .PERIOD ♫ this is a loop feedback loop .PERIOD ♫ ♫ this is a loop feedback loop .PERIOD ♫ ♫ this is a loop feedback loop .PERIOD ♫ ♫ this is a loop feedback loop .PERIOD ♫ ♫ this is a loop feedback loop .PERIOD ♫ ♫ this is a loop feedback loop .PERIOD ♫ ♫ this is a -- ,COMMA all right .PERIOD i don't know if that was necessary to demonstrate -- -- .PERIOD but my point is ,COMMA it's the sound of self-destruction .PERIOD there seems to be a rule in nature that if you get too close to where you came from ,COMMA it gets ugly .PERIOD the oil was running out and a nuclear winter would finish us off .PERIOD it just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand ,COMMA homo erectus ,COMMA made the same tool for 30000 generations .PERIOD of course ,COMMA there were a few changes ,COMMA but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days .PERIOD it's an extraordinary phenomenon ,COMMA but it's true and more than that .PERIOD it's a confection of different ideas .PERIOD the idea of plastic ,COMMA the idea of a laser ,COMMA the idea of transistors ,COMMA one goes extinct for the other to survive .PERIOD so what sex does is it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species .PERIOD so oz is better at both spears and axes than adam ask yourself ,COMMA how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by ?QUESTIONMARK and that's seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you've gained since 1950 as it were ,COMMA because that's seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else ,COMMA or you can acquire another good or service .PERIOD they were a highly intelligent species .PERIOD the reason because tierra del fuego is separated from south america by a much narrower straight .PERIOD and there was trading contact across that straight throughout 10000 years ,COMMA the tasmanians were isolated .PERIOD it's not the same with language with language .PERIOD we have to transfer ideas that we understand with each other .PERIOD there will be wars .PERIOD there will be depressions .PERIOD there will be natural disasters .PERIOD my work is about the behaviors that we all engage in unconsciously on a collective level ,COMMA and as individuals ,COMMA we all do these things all the time everyday .PERIOD it's like when you're mean to your wife ,COMMA because you're mad at somebody else ,COMMA or when you overeat ,COMMA because your feelings are hurt or whatever that's 15 minutes of our cup consumption .PERIOD and if you could actually stack up that many cups in real life ,COMMA that's the size ,COMMA it would be .PERIOD i wanted to make a piece that shows the actual number of americans who die from cigarette smoking .PERIOD and we aren't talking about it -- .PERIOD we dismiss it and strangely enough ,COMMA the only plastic surgery that is more popular than breast augmentation is liposuction .PERIOD and most of that is being done by men .PERIOD my belief is that you don't have to make yourself bad to look at these issues .PERIOD how can we investigate this flora of viruses that surround us and aid medicine ?QUESTIONMARK but evolution is a balance where you have fast change .PERIOD you also have ultra-conservation -- things that almost never change .PERIOD and so we looked into this a little more carefully ,COMMA and i'm going to show you data now down here .PERIOD you can see slower evolution ,COMMA less diversity ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK so that's what we did .PERIOD but how are we going to do that ?QUESTIONMARK if you've got enough money to buy just a camry ,COMMA you can build one of these too .PERIOD and so we put a deep how-to guide on the web ,COMMA totally free with basically order-off-the-shelf parts .PERIOD and so what we did -- .PERIOD and this is a really cool project -- .PERIOD we just started by making a respiratory virus chip .PERIOD that's the scourge of daycare centers everywhere -- .PERIOD it's like boogeremia ,COMMA basically .PERIOD and so it is not any one stripe or something .PERIOD that tells me .PERIOD i have a virus of a particular type here .PERIOD it's the barcode that in bulk represents the whole thing .PERIOD that's me getting a nasal lavage .PERIOD actually ,COMMA we thought the nasal tract might be full of viruses ,COMMA even when you're walking around healthy .PERIOD so that's great .PERIOD but again ,COMMA cheap shot ,COMMA right .PERIOD so we built out the chip .PERIOD now ,COMMA we're using this chip ,COMMA and what are we using it for ?QUESTIONMARK and this is what this looks like .PERIOD and that is ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA what these particular cell cultures are chronically infected with .PERIOD so let's do something a little bit harder .PERIOD they did a ct scan switch antibiotics .PERIOD so they switched to another antibiotic tamiflu .PERIOD there's almost no epidemiology or studies on it .PERIOD and why is that just lore ?QUESTIONMARK there's no data ,COMMA -- ,COMMA no data to support whether it causes severe or mild disease .PERIOD it doesn't make sense -- ,COMMA unless maybe there's a virus .PERIOD and this is a little phylogenetic tree to see how it's related to other viruses .PERIOD is it the case that these guys are just more susceptible to viruses .PERIOD this was all done by folks in the lab -- .PERIOD i cannot take credit for most of this .PERIOD i'm talking about the production of aluminum .PERIOD the electrolyte is not a solution of salt and water ,COMMA but rather salt .PERIOD that's melted .PERIOD so now how to choose the metals .PERIOD i felt the thrill of realization .PERIOD when i knew i'd come upon the answer .PERIOD it's pretty cool .PERIOD at least in theory .PERIOD we go to the laboratory ,COMMA no ,COMMA i hire a student and mentor him .PERIOD teach him how to think about the problem to see it from my perspective .PERIOD and then turn him loose ,COMMA and i was able to attract really ,COMMA really good people people who share my passion for science and service to society ,COMMA not science and service for career building .PERIOD i went to aspen recently and stumbled into this song .PERIOD ♫ black men go to aspen ♫ ♫ and rent colorful chalets .PERIOD ♫ ♫ giggle at the questions ♫ ♫ their mere presence seems to raise ♫ ♫ get taken for men ♫ ♫ we don't resemble in the least ♫ are you .PERIOD and since they discovered those things ,COMMA it really stuck with them so much more ,COMMA and also they would experience their own failures .PERIOD there was a failure-based aspect to learning there .PERIOD it was very important .PERIOD and another thing that really impressed me ,COMMA a long time ago was powers of ten .PERIOD charles and ray eames' film .PERIOD and so i'm going to show you a toy today that i've been working on that ,COMMA i think of more than anything else as kind of a philosophy toy .PERIOD now ,COMMA we actually play through many generations here at the cellular scale .PERIOD but basically ,COMMA this is the editor where we're going to design the next generation of our creature .PERIOD so it has a little spine .PERIOD but really the goal here was within about a minute .PERIOD i wanted somebody to replicate .PERIOD what typically takes a pictorial artist several weeks to create ,COMMA ok .PERIOD now ,COMMA i'll put some hands on it ,COMMA and i can see how it might dance .PERIOD i can also play with the dynamics of this world over time .PERIOD and our cities are going to be at risk too ,COMMA because a lot of these are coastal cities here .PERIOD it is some indigenous life down here .PERIOD you see now they've actually gone to tribal dynamics .PERIOD i think i'll leave before they get hostile .PERIOD but these are the things that we can kind of put in this little galaxy here ,COMMA because i think most of the problems that our world is facing right .PERIOD now is the result of short-term thinking ,COMMA and the fact that it is so hard for us to think 50 100 or 1000 years out .PERIOD and so i'm going to talk a little bit about that keeping in mind that we have a lot on the program here ,COMMA what's in it for the ant ?QUESTIONMARK no ,COMMA it's worse than that .PERIOD there are a lot of ideas to die for the secret of happiness is find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it .PERIOD actually ,COMMA i think we're all responsible for not just the intended effects of our ideas ,COMMA but for their likely misuses .PERIOD so let me just point out memes are like viruses ,COMMA and you might think ,COMMA well ,COMMA how can that be ?QUESTIONMARK they're made of information and can be carried in any physical medium .PERIOD not just the priests .PERIOD everybody ,COMMA after all the meme for shaker-dom was essentially a sterilizing parasite .PERIOD but among all those ideas that inevitably flow out into the whole world ,COMMA thanks to our technology are a lot of toxic ideas ,COMMA and it's not our fault anymore than it's our fault .PERIOD when our germs lay waste to people that haven't developed the immunity ,COMMA we drove to the goodwill ,COMMA and we threw the sweater away .PERIOD somewhat ceremoniously .PERIOD my idea being that i would never have to think about the sweater ,COMMA nor see it ever again .PERIOD i tell that story because it has served and continues to serve as a metaphor to me about the level of connectedness that we all have on this earth .PERIOD it's thrilling first ,COMMA she talked about comfort status beauty ,COMMA and we've started making curtains ,COMMA and not only is it beautiful ,COMMA but people can see status -- that you care about your children .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD my job depends upon it up to .PERIOD and around about the second world war conductors were invariably dictators -- .PERIOD these tyrannical figures who would rehearse not just the orchestra as a whole ,COMMA but individuals within it within an inch of their lives .PERIOD let's be under no illusions simply through singing .PERIOD so we got some shows off the ground .PERIOD we started touring them internationally .PERIOD one of them was carmen .PERIOD i want to play you a tiny clip of it now ,COMMA for no other reason than to give you proof positive that there is nothing tiny about south african music making .PERIOD they don't read music .PERIOD and yet ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA every single one of us on this planet ,COMMA probably engages with music on a daily basis .PERIOD i've got a little experiment .PERIOD i want to try with you .PERIOD t see .PERIOD it's the same as f in music there .PERIOD i am like a bloody windmill again .PERIOD you see the music will start .PERIOD and then at a signal from me ,COMMA you will sing that one more time with feeling ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA it's going to be britain's first ever national disabled orchestra clarence .PERIOD i would rather be able to play an instrument again than walk .PERIOD i only wish that some of those musicians were here with us today .PERIOD so you could see at firsthand how utterly extraordinary they are .PERIOD if any of you thinks you want to help me in any way to achieve what is a fairly impossible and implausible dream .PERIOD still at this point ,COMMA please ,COMMA let me know haydn remonstrated with the prince ,COMMA but to no avail .PERIOD ♫ like the heather ♫ ♫ on the hillside ♫ ♫ as they drove us ♫ ♫ from the highlands ♫ ♫ like the ice flow ♫ ♫ from the arctic ♫ ♫

.PERIOD ♫ ♫ blue remembered ♫ ♫ blue water ♫ ♫ running clear ♫ ♫ blue like a planet ♫ ♫ to a spaceman ♫ ♫ blue river ♫ ♫ of my tears ♫ ♫ so i came here ♫ ♫ to the city ♫ ♫ where the dream burns ♫ ♫

blue river .PERIOD ♫ ♫ of my tears ♫ ♫ blue river .PERIOD ♫ ♫ of my tears ♫ well ,COMMA the subject of difficult negotiation reminds me of one of my favorite stories from the middle east of a man who left to his three sons 17 .PERIOD camels seventeen doesn't divide by two the wise old woman thought about their problem for a long time .PERIOD and finally ,COMMA she came back and said ,COMMA well ,COMMA i don't know if i can help you .PERIOD but at least if you want ,COMMA you can have my camel .PERIOD they had one camel left over .PERIOD now ,COMMA if you think about that story for a moment ,COMMA i think it resembles a lot of the difficult negotiations we get involved in as i've spent the last better part of three decades ,COMMA almost four traveling the world ,COMMA trying to work getting involved in conflicts ,COMMA ranging from yugoslavia to the middle east to chechnya to venezuela ,COMMA some of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet .PERIOD i've been asking myself that question .PERIOD so how do they deal with their differences ?QUESTIONMARK but what we don't often see is that there's always a third side .PERIOD and the third side of the conflict is us .PERIOD it's the surrounding community .PERIOD it's the friends ,COMMA the allies ,COMMA the family members ,COMMA the neighbors ,COMMA perhaps ,COMMA the most fundamental way in which the third side can help is to remind the parties of what's really at stake .PERIOD and we met in the hague in the peace palace in the same room ,COMMA where the yugoslav war crimes tribunal was taking place .PERIOD and then he went on ,COMMA and then he turned to me and said ,COMMA you're an american .PERIOD now ,COMMA i don't pretend to have an answer to the middle east conflict .PERIOD but i think i've got a first step ,COMMA literally ,COMMA a first step ,COMMA something that any one of us could do as third-siders .PERIOD and so my question is ,COMMA yes ,COMMA let's try and resolve the politics there in the middle east .PERIOD but let's also take a look at the story .PERIOD let's see if we can apply the third side to it .PERIOD what would that mean ?QUESTIONMARK what is the story there ?QUESTIONMARK now ,COMMA as anthropologists ,COMMA we know that every culture has an origin story ,COMMA that man ,COMMA of course ,COMMA was abraham .PERIOD what's the opposite of terrorism ?QUESTIONMARK it's taking an innocent stranger and treating them as a friend ,COMMA whom you welcome into your home in order to sow and create understanding or respect or love .PERIOD and that's what comes to the first step here .PERIOD that's the essence of the abraham path .PERIOD so what we discovered is that abraham is not just a figure out of a book for those people .PERIOD and just a couple weeks ago ,COMMA there was an npr story on it ,COMMA and they quoted ,COMMA a villager who said ,COMMA this walk connects us to the world .PERIOD she's partially blind .PERIOD her husband can't work .PERIOD she's got seven kids .PERIOD and so more and more walkers have come and lately ,COMMA she's begun to earn an income to support her family .PERIOD so my question is ,COMMA if it can be done in europe ,COMMA why not in the middle east that's walking abraham's path after a tedtalk ?QUESTIONMARK why not a tedwalk ?QUESTIONMARK there's an old african proverb that goes when spider webs unite .PERIOD they can halt ,COMMA even the lion .PERIOD if we're able to unite our third-side webs of peace ,COMMA we can even halt the lion of war .PERIOD well ,COMMA what is needed for the earliest possible warning of a heart attack ?QUESTIONMARK a means to determine if there's a complete blockage of a coronary artery .PERIOD and if we had a computer ,COMMA put into the body of a person who's at risk ,COMMA we could know before they even have symptoms that they're having a heart attack to save their life .PERIOD and what we tried with the pig was external electrodes on the skin ,COMMA like you see in an emergency room .PERIOD and i'm going to show you why they don't work very well next to it at 30 seconds .PERIOD you see this rise here .PERIOD then this rise -- .PERIOD that's the st elevation .PERIOD then on friday at 643 ,COMMA he began to get certain signs ,COMMA which later we had the pig run around -- .PERIOD i'm not going to go into this early stage .PERIOD finally ,COMMA if you're lucky ,COMMA you are treated in three or four hours after the incident ,COMMA but the heart muscle has died .PERIOD and now i want to talk about something entirely different .PERIOD so here's a picture of what we're doing .PERIOD there's this migraine that is preceded by a visual aura ,COMMA and this visual aura by the way -- .PERIOD and i'll show you a picture -- ,COMMA but it sort of begins with little dancing lights gets bigger and bigger until it fills your whole visual field .PERIOD christina sidebottom .PERIOD well ,COMMA my first reaction was that it was -- ,COMMA looked awfully gun-like .PERIOD and it was very strange .PERIOD the most severe headaches responded better after we did it several times .PERIOD and the unexpected ,COMMA finding indicates that even established headaches ,COMMA not only those with aura get treated and get diminished .PERIOD well ,COMMA responsive electrical stimulation means that we sense at a place in your brain ,COMMA which is called an epileptic focus ,COMMA which is where the epileptic seizure begins -- .PERIOD we sense there that it's going to happen .PERIOD and then we respond by applying an electrical energy at that spot ,COMMA which erases the errant signal ,COMMA so that you don't get the clinical manifestations of the migraine headache that concludes my discussion of epilepsy ,COMMA which is the third invention that i want to discuss here .PERIOD this afternoon ,COMMA we want to have some people who really know how to do this ,COMMA perform human engineering studies to develop the optimum design for the portable device for treating migraine headaches .PERIOD and that is the second wish we needed to take what we had built and create a platform out of it so that it could be used elsewhere in the world .PERIOD and so there is a team of developers from all over africa ,COMMA who are part of this team now -- from ghana from malawi from kenya ,COMMA what is the veracity level of what you're looking at ?QUESTIONMARK so you've got a lot of information .PERIOD that's great take the crowd and apply them to the information .PERIOD and we are very happy to be part of the ted family .PERIOD it's inevitable terrible .PERIOD but really what i want to talk about is i'm just fascinated by the legacy .PERIOD people leave when they die a value for things with a personal touch -- ,COMMA an autograph book ,COMMA a soul-searching letter .PERIOD if a fraction of this powerful ted audience could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper ,COMMA -- ,COMMA john .PERIOD it'll be a recycled one ,COMMA -- and write a beautiful letter to someone they love .PERIOD we actually may start a revolution where our children may go to penmanship classes .PERIOD so what do i plan to leave for my son ?QUESTIONMARK i plan to publish my own notebook .PERIOD i have no idea how i'm going to do it .PERIOD but i am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine into a book ,COMMA and leave that published book for my son .PERIOD what's happened in the music world is there's a culture or an ecosystem .PERIOD that's been created that if you take some words from apple ,COMMA the catchphrase that we create rip ,COMMA mix and burn .PERIOD and what that's done is it's created like i said ,COMMA a vibrant community that's very inclusive with people continually working to connect musical ideas ,COMMA innovate them and keep things constantly up to date .PERIOD imagine making it free so that anyone in the world can have access to all of this knowledge and imagine using information technology ,COMMA so that you can update this content ,COMMA improve it play with it on a timescale .PERIOD that's more on the order of seconds .PERIOD instead of years ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA a lot of this use coming from unites states k-through-12 schools ,COMMA because anyone who's involved in a school scale back the first thing that's cut is the music curriculum .PERIOD and so this is just indicating the tremendous thirst for this kind of open free content .PERIOD we've been working with amd ,COMMA which has a project called 50 by '15 ,COMMA which is trying to bring internet connectivity ,COMMA to 50 percent of the world's population ,COMMA by 2015 ,COMMA in particular ,COMMA a bunch of the projects that are funded by hewlett foundation ,COMMA who have taken a real leadership role in this area of open content .PERIOD ok ,COMMA burn .PERIOD i think this is sort of quite interesting .PERIOD how much would it cost in a bookstore ?QUESTIONMARK why does it cost 22 dollars ?QUESTIONMARK remember ,COMMA we took the book tore the pages out .PERIOD imagine music xml that actually lets you delve into the semantic structure of music play with it understand it ,COMMA even the three wise men ,COMMA because we're saying that anybody can contribute things to this commons .PERIOD anybody can contribute anything .PERIOD so ,COMMA thanks very much .PERIOD i've been at mit for 44 years .PERIOD i went to ted .PERIOD i everybody agrees that whatever the solutions are to the big problems .PERIOD they include education .PERIOD sometimes can be just education and can never be without some element of education .PERIOD so ,COMMA with those as the principles -- ,COMMA some of you may know seymour papert .PERIOD this is back in 1982 when we were working in senegal .PERIOD here we're in the '80s and these kids ,COMMA their first english word is google ,COMMA and they only know skype .PERIOD they've never heard of telephony .PERIOD screw you go to the back of the line ,COMMA and someone else will do it .PERIOD and then when you figure out that this works ,COMMA you can join as well .PERIOD and the idea is to launch with enough scale that the scale itself helps bring the price down .PERIOD and that's why i said ,COMMA seven to 10 million there .PERIOD now ,COMMA once people start looking at this ,COMMA they say ,COMMA ah ,COMMA this is a laptop project because laptop economics are the following .PERIOD i say ,COMMA 50 percent here .PERIOD it's more like 60 ,COMMA 60 percent of the cost of your laptop is sales ,COMMA marketing distribution and profit .PERIOD ok ,COMMA i've been using laptops since their inception .PERIOD the dual mode display -- .PERIOD the idea is to have a display that both works outdoors -- .PERIOD isn't it fun using your cell phone outdoors in the sunlight ?QUESTIONMARK and in about 30 days ,COMMA we'll know for sure ,COMMA whether this works ,COMMA probably the most important piece there is that the kids really can do the maintenance .PERIOD so this is just a mechanical engineering ,COMMA sort of embodiment of it for you to play with everybody thinks they know about education .PERIOD a lot of culture is built into it as well .PERIOD well guess what we're not because there's no market for post office trucks .PERIOD you can spray paint it .PERIOD you can do anything you want that came from a 1960 paper on space ,COMMA travel .PERIOD because if you think about it ,COMMA space is pretty awkward .PERIOD he said ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no .PERIOD here's a better way .PERIOD and he said ,COMMA well ,COMMA okay .PERIOD and if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone ,COMMA the room would be very crowded .PERIOD these are the people that you have access to right now in general -- ,COMMA all of these people ,COMMA all of your friends and family that you can connect to .PERIOD but when you actually visualize it all the connections that we're doing right now -- .PERIOD this is an image of the mapping of the internet -- .PERIOD it doesn't look technological .PERIOD it actually looks very organic .PERIOD it's that they're helping us to be more human ,COMMA helping us to connect with each other .PERIOD we're just increasing our humanness and our ability to connect with each other ,COMMA regardless of geography .PERIOD so that's why i study cyborg anthropology .PERIOD and people are initially reluctant to tell you .PERIOD we talk about things in relative terms .PERIOD and so when we look at these pmtct programs ,COMMA what does it mean ?QUESTIONMARK imagine yourself if you can you're a young woman in africa .PERIOD you're going to the hospital or clinic ,COMMA and you don't know who you can talk to .PERIOD because the truth is ,COMMA hiv is so stigmatizing that if you partner your family ,COMMA anyone in your home ,COMMA you're likely to be thrown out without any means of support .PERIOD and this -- .PERIOD this is the face and story of hiv in africa today .PERIOD but we're here to talk about possible solutions .PERIOD and some good news ,COMMA our organization ,COMMA mothers2mothers enlists women with hiv as care providers .PERIOD but if you wanted to understand what that surgery would do to your life ,COMMA you'd like to engage someone someone who's had the procedure .PERIOD and so doctors and nurses -- ,COMMA they look up to them as experts .PERIOD men are not frequently part of pregnancy care .PERIOD and this is so important in breaking through the stigma .PERIOD and if we can change enough communities ,COMMA we can change national attitudes .PERIOD we have the medicines we have the tests ,COMMA but how do you reduce the stigma ?QUESTIONMARK i've been afraid to tell everybody .PERIOD how do you build a better health care system ?QUESTIONMARK and our organization helps women across that bridge .PERIOD the program is now working in nine countries .PERIOD we have 670 program sites .PERIOD we're seeing about 230000 women every month .PERIOD we're employing 1600 mentor mothers .PERIOD and last year ,COMMA they enrolled 300000 hiv-positive pregnant women and mothers .PERIOD all of this is possible .PERIOD if we each contribute to this fight .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD then they irradiate our food trying to make it last longer .PERIOD so it can travel thousands of miles from where it's grown to the supermarkets .PERIOD this man joel salatin .PERIOD they call him a lunatic farmer ,COMMA because he grows against the system .PERIOD since i'm home-schooled .PERIOD i went to go hear him speak one day .PERIOD i want you to know that there are farmers' markets in every community popping up ,COMMA not too long ago .PERIOD my uncle said that he offered my six-year-old cousin cereal .PERIOD now we had a harvard professor here -- .PERIOD she was from harvard .PERIOD i just wanted to mention and -- ,COMMA and she was actually a professor from harvard the scales .PERIOD here are religiosity from zero percent or atheist to 100 percent bible literally true .PERIOD now let's talk about some of the characteristics that are important for this revolutionary device .PERIOD first of all ,COMMA it needs to be small .PERIOD now ,COMMA i bought this device from clifford stoll for about 900 bucks ,COMMA free bird .PERIOD ok ,COMMA one more time .PERIOD -- .PERIOD i'm just going to give you a little help .PERIOD and finally ,COMMA we're going to put the marriott hotel and the portola plaza on the top mr .PERIOD vice president .PERIOD i wish i knew how to quit you and sylvia earle .PERIOD and i were on an expedition in this submarine 20 years ago in japan .PERIOD but when i got there ,COMMA i found lots of plastic garbage and other debris .PERIOD it's in the mid-pacific .PERIOD it's about five days from anywhere .PERIOD so that's when i first learned of the islands and had no idea what i was getting into .PERIOD it's a very deep-water part of our planet .PERIOD but we got up there ,COMMA and i had the unique and wonderful scientific opportunity and personal opportunity to get to a place that had never been dived and just get to an island and go .PERIOD okay ,COMMA where are we going to dive ?QUESTIONMARK let's try there and then falling into the water ,COMMA the phoenix islands ,COMMA and all the equatorial parts of our planet are very important for tuna fisheries ,COMMA especially this yellowfin tuna that you see here .PERIOD so i thought the scenes of never-ending wilderness would go on forever ,COMMA but they did finally come to an end .PERIOD they basically are one nation that controls most of the equatorial waters of the central pacific ocean .PERIOD and for some reason they didn't want me to come ,COMMA or it was hard to find a time and a place .PERIOD and it took a while .PERIOD but finally ,COMMA they said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA you can come .PERIOD and i was free for dinner .PERIOD and i went out to dinner with the minister of fisheries in kiribati .PERIOD it had occurred on land in rainforests of south america and africa where landowners had been paid not to cut the trees down .PERIOD so we had very strong leadership ,COMMA very good vision ,COMMA and a lot of science ,COMMA a lot of lawyers involved .PERIOD so suddenly we had this area that we were protecting .PERIOD but now it appeared to be dead at least in the coral areas .PERIOD and that's the story with climate-change heating .PERIOD and we are now in the process of raising the full endowment .PERIOD and i actually went to see some of the design companies in hong kong in my stay there .PERIOD and i'll just give you one example .PERIOD i had gotten my first walkman last november ,COMMA a museum opened in tokyo ,COMMA called the mori museum in a skyscraper up on the 56th floor .PERIOD and for sure i haven't looked at the sky in the same way after spending an hour in there ,COMMA you know ,COMMA one is just working without pressure .PERIOD this is ,COMMA you know ,COMMA related to it .PERIOD getting out of the studio again .PERIOD we could supply the content for it .PERIOD icons like batman ,COMMA superman wonder woman .PERIOD and their colleagues will be teaming up with icons .PERIOD jabbar :COLON noora jami and their colleagues as christian iconography ,COMMA got changed and swastikas were created out of crucifixes batman .PERIOD and superman were created by jewish young men in the united states and canada ,COMMA also going back to the bible .PERIOD superman is not only sent to earth from the heavens or krypton .PERIOD but he's sent in a pod much like moses was on the nile .PERIOD so 33 of the stones are smuggled onto the nina ,COMMA the pinta and the santa maria and are spread in the new world to which he said ,COMMA let them be because what they're giving us is worth a lot more than what we're paying them .PERIOD so these 99 stones a few kind of rules in the game number one ,COMMA you don't choose the stone .PERIOD the stone chooses you .PERIOD well ,COMMA we have jabbar from saudi who starts breaking things when he has the power .PERIOD i'm like ,COMMA are all the girls going to be kind and merciful ,COMMA and the guys all strong that's not timely .PERIOD and that led to all kinds of things from being in curricula in universities and schools to -- .PERIOD one of my favorite pictures i have from south asia .PERIOD it was a couple of men with long beards and a lot of girls wearing the hijab -- .PERIOD it looked like a school opened a theme park through a license in kuwait a year ,COMMA and a half ago called the 99 village theme park ,COMMA -- 300000 square feet ,COMMA 20 rides all with our characters .PERIOD a couple back-to-school licenses in spain and turkey .PERIOD rughal .PERIOD there must be something we can do dr .PERIOD razem .PERIOD it's time to go miklos :COLON you are noora the light .PERIOD i don't deserve it .PERIOD i don't deserve anything .PERIOD jabbar :COLON we're here to help you .PERIOD miklos :COLON no .PERIOD he gave me access ,COMMA and you want to reboot the [unclear] ,COMMA no more [unclear] as the father of five sons .PERIOD i worry about who they're going to be using as role models and torture's ,COMMA a terrible enough thing as it is .PERIOD but when it's done by your hero ,COMMA that just breaks you in so many ways .PERIOD now ,COMMA one of the things that i refer to when i -- about the importance of this message -- is that i gave a lecture at the medical school at kuwait university where i lecture on the biological basis of behavior .PERIOD and i gave the students two articles one from the new york times ,COMMA and one from new york magazine ,COMMA any boys and girls caught flirting would get married off immediately .PERIOD okay ,COMMA the second one took place in upstate new york .PERIOD she was actually coming out of an amnesty international meeting .PERIOD and the good news is there might be an easy solution to that .PERIOD and that's using our eyes more ,COMMA and it mushroomed slightly afghanistan and iraq mushroomed now to 3000 billion .PERIOD so there it is .PERIOD 227 billion is what africa owes .PERIOD and the recent financial crisis .PERIOD how much of this diagram might that figure take up ?QUESTIONMARK we need to imagine what a landscape of the world's fears might look like .PERIOD this is mountains out of molehills ,COMMA a timeline of global media panic .PERIOD and there's a very interesting and odd pattern hidden in this data that you can only see when you visualize it .PERIOD let me show you this .PERIOD i'll take answers .PERIOD i wonder if i could make my life beautiful ,COMMA it's the language of the eye .PERIOD but of course ,COMMA china has an enormous population .PERIOD and if it can do that ,COMMA maybe it can also change your behavior .PERIOD but what it points to is that visualizing information like this is a form of knowledge compression .PERIOD so heart is filtered out .PERIOD so i can see if i'm curious about that .PERIOD so the data is now alive .PERIOD this is a living image ,COMMA and i can update it in a second .PERIOD it's even fun to engage with them ,COMMA because it's visual .PERIOD and that is beautiful .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD i will show it to you .PERIOD the top note that you smelled at the very beginning ,COMMA the cut-grass green ,COMMA what we call in perfumery -- they’re ,COMMA weird terms -- .PERIOD and this would be called a green note ,COMMA because it smells of something green like cut grass .PERIOD this is cis-3-hexene-1-ol ,COMMA and i had to learn chemistry on the fly in the last three years ,COMMA a very expensive high school chemistry education .PERIOD

there is no substitute for wisdom .PERIOD first of all ,COMMA we started off the nuclear age in 1945 .PERIOD we had a few nuclear weapons ,COMMA two of which we dropped on japan in hiroshima ,COMMA a few days later in nagasaki ,COMMA in august 1945 killing about 250000 people between those two .PERIOD so the goal was to evacuate the target cities .PERIOD we would move people out of the target cities into the countryside .PERIOD this disconnect was never actually resolved .PERIOD so what is a nuclear terror threat ?QUESTIONMARK there are plans for how to create a terror farm where you could actually manufacture and develop all the components and assemble it since there is no real retribution possible that would make any difference since there are people willing to actually give up their lives in order to do a lot of damage to us .PERIOD it becomes apparent that the whole notion of this mutually assured destruction would not work .PERIOD you take it wherever you want to take it ,COMMA and you can detonate it .PERIOD you can't get an exact number for that kind of probability .PERIOD but what i'm trying to say is that we have all the elements of that happening .PERIOD i don't think we would see an all-out nuclear war any time soon ,COMMA although even that is not completely off the table .PERIOD there's still enough nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the superpowers to destroy the earth many many times over .PERIOD we're coming down .PERIOD and we bring that truck that you just saw somewhere in here in the financial district .PERIOD this is a 10-kiloton bomb ,COMMA slightly smaller than was used in hiroshima .PERIOD and i want to just conclude this by just giving you some information .PERIOD i think -- news .PERIOD you could use kind of concept here .PERIOD and if you're in this vicinity ,COMMA you've got to get away .PERIOD and if you're wearing clothing ,COMMA you've taken off your clothing ,COMMA you're going to get showered down some place and remove the radiation

biosignature ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA it's any measurable phenomenon that allows us to indicate the presence of life .PERIOD but immediately the system goes like ,COMMA what kind of dumb piece of code was this .PERIOD so you see waves of new types taking over the other types .PERIOD as long as i know that there's some sort of alphabet .PERIOD and obviously each of these letters comes off about roughly equally frequent .PERIOD and if i look at french texts ,COMMA it looks a little bit different or italian or german .PERIOD it doesn't matter whether it's a poem ,COMMA or whether it's a mathematical text ,COMMA the avidians being the denizens of this computer world ,COMMA where they are perfectly happy replicating and growing in complexity ,COMMA too hot ,COMMA too hot .PERIOD and i'm just showing this to you again ,COMMA because it's so nice ,COMMA one of them is if we are able to think about life in abstract terms -- .PERIOD and we're not talking about things like plants ,COMMA and we're not talking about amino acids ,COMMA and we're not talking about bacteria ,COMMA but we think in terms of processes -- ,COMMA then we could start to think about life ,COMMA not as something that is so special to earth ,COMMA but that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA could exist anywhere .PERIOD but what really turns me on about technology is not just the ability to get more songs on mp3

that's not a cause .PERIOD that's an emergency .PERIOD and what we're facing in africa is an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality .PERIOD that's right .PERIOD we like to give .PERIOD and

rigor in this room .PERIOD there's an opportunity here ,COMMA and it's real our credibility .PERIOD i can't you can't as individuals ,COMMA but we can change the world .PERIOD but working together ,COMMA we can actually change the world ideas that you gestated in your youth .PERIOD well now ,COMMA actually ,COMMA because of you ,COMMA it is possible to change the physical world .PERIOD so why then are we not pumping our fists into the air ,COMMA but for the first time in history ,COMMA we have the technology we have the know-how .PERIOD we have the cash .PERIOD we have the life-saving drugs ,COMMA the clash wore ,COMMA big army boots ,COMMA not sandals ,COMMA but some of them ,COMMA they haven't not only in lives saved ,COMMA but in goodwill stability and security that we'll gain what i hope is that beyond individual merciful acts that you will tell the politicians to do right by africa by america ,COMMA and by the world ,COMMA give us that kind of dreaming that kind of doing the war against terror .PERIOD yes ,COMMA actually ,COMMA we're talking to abc today about the oscars .PERIOD we need to get the math .PERIOD we need to get the statistics out to the american people

very important for ethiopia .PERIOD -- will transform the country .PERIOD i am ,COMMA of course ,COMMA referring to none other than elvis presley and love is not love .PERIOD but being all shook up does that correspond ?QUESTIONMARK metaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia in which we understand one concept in the context of another .PERIOD one of the sentences was some jobs are jails .PERIOD and they had those expectations because agent metaphors imply ,COMMA the deliberate action of a living thing pursuing a goal .PERIOD but there is a better translation .PERIOD the latin word cogito is derived from the prefix co meaning together .PERIOD and the verb agitare meaning to shake .PERIOD and in that sense ,COMMA ballooning is a beautiful metaphor .PERIOD we want to go in a direction ,COMMA but the winds push us in another direction like in life .PERIOD and as long as we fight horizontally against life against the winds against what's happening to us .PERIOD life is a nightmare .PERIOD how do we go from the metaphor to something more practical that we can really use every day ?QUESTIONMARK it's not true .PERIOD this is very practical .PERIOD this is why you need people with long-term vision .PERIOD but we were expected to have doubts .PERIOD we're expected to have fears .PERIOD it's to show you how much gas was left in the last bottles .PERIOD we landed with

authority ,COMMA but a woman's got to do what a woman's got to do .PERIOD it's about proving who you are and what you can do .PERIOD but in assuming this responsibility and going about it as you have ,COMMA you have become a bridge between an older and traditional society ,COMMA and the one that you are now creating at the paper .PERIOD and this is true .PERIOD well ,COMMA the yemen times across 20 years has been through so much .PERIOD they think that if there's anything against them ,COMMA then we are being an opposition newspaper and very ,COMMA very difficult times .PERIOD and he ended up writing about a story that even surprised me -- .PERIOD hip hop -- that there are young yemeni men who express themselves through dancing and puchu puchu .PERIOD that thing i'm not so old ,COMMA actually ,COMMA that's a documentary that's available online the video's online ,COMMA and certainly you yourself .PERIOD and what you do have given us a view of the future that we will embrace and be

talks about in the film is something called bisphenol a bpa ,COMMA which has been in the news recently .PERIOD so we're dosing our babies ,COMMA our newborns ,COMMA our infants with a synthetic estrogen .PERIOD so the pup you see on the bottom is affected by atrazine that its grandmother was exposed to ,COMMA and given the life of many of these chemicals generations years dozens of years .PERIOD that means that we right now are affecting the health of our grandchildren's grandchildren by things that we're putting into the environment today .PERIOD and this was something that was

.PERIOD we've tried to rectify this imbalance by making art writing poems singing songs ,COMMA scripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper ,COMMA gossiping with friends .PERIOD this is nothing new .PERIOD it's been running for about a year and a half .PERIOD and i'll show you a glimpse of how this information is then visualized .PERIOD so this is we feel fine .PERIOD the dots exhibit human qualities ,COMMA they kind of have their own physics ,COMMA and they swarm wildly around kind of exploring the world of life .PERIOD and then they also exhibit curiosity .PERIOD there's also murmurs montage mobs metrics and mounds ,COMMA and then one by one in reverse chronological order .PERIOD they excuse themselves entering the scrolling list of feelings .PERIOD i feel invisible to you .PERIOD i feel in love with carolyn .PERIOD i feel so naughty .PERIOD this is in response to what's beautiful miss world .PERIOD and it caused me to wonder about our world today .PERIOD and those are the questions that inspired my new project ,COMMA which is debuting here today at ted .PERIOD it's called universe ,COMMA revealing our modern mythology .PERIOD this is the universe of 2007 ,COMMA the last two months ,COMMA but we can actually be more specific in defining our universe .PERIOD so we see obama and the clintons meet in alabama ,COMMA you can see that this is an important story .PERIOD there are a lot of things in its orbit .PERIOD if we open this up ,COMMA we get different perspectives on this story ,COMMA and you'll all be able to use it and kind of explore what your own personal mythology might be as you search for the things that are important to you in your world .PERIOD and then see what the constellations of those might look like .PERIOD we're facing this problem .PERIOD there is the problem ,COMMA and you know ,COMMA going back maybe 10 years in time ,COMMA when i got the funding to buy my first graphics computer -- ,COMMA it was a huge machine .PERIOD it was cabinets of processors and storage and everything .PERIOD this is a data set that was captured using a ct scanner .PERIOD and of course ,COMMA all the data is inside .PERIOD so i can start rotating .PERIOD i can look at it from different angles .PERIOD and i can see that this woman had a problem .PERIOD and one of the applications that we've been working on -- .PERIOD and this has gotten a little bit of traction worldwide .PERIOD -- is the application of virtual autopsies .PERIOD so this is from a virtual autopsy .PERIOD the person was killed by stabs in the heart ,COMMA but they just deposited the knife by putting it through one of the eyeballs .PERIOD here's another case that i think is interesting during a physical autopsy .PERIOD if you actually have to dig through the body to find these fragments ,COMMA that's actually quite hard to do .PERIOD so if you have the opportunity ,COMMA please try it out .PERIOD it's really a hands-on experience .PERIOD and this is a bit of science fiction now .PERIOD so we're moving into really the future .PERIOD and he's also hearing our instructions when we tell him to do things .PERIOD and in just a second here ,COMMA you will see -- .PERIOD okay ,COMMA here motts now move your left foot .PERIOD i can look inside of it .PERIOD and here it is here is the nose of the bear .PERIOD well ,COMMA 80 percent of the men in lesotho worked in the mines over the border in brutal conditions .PERIOD he was the son of one of the poorest families in the village ,COMMA perhaps the universe existed before the bang .PERIOD and the bang was just a violent event in a pre-existing universe .PERIOD i won't go into the details of why we think the universe is like this .PERIOD but it comes out of the math and trying to explain the physics that we know and there've been bangs in the past .PERIOD and there will be bangs in the future .PERIOD what about africa ?QUESTIONMARK it's still going on .PERIOD what about africa's capacity to do something about these problems ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA here's the number of physicians in africa .PERIOD and while i was busy working -- ,COMMA i was working on these colliding worlds in the day ,COMMA and we got lots of applicants .PERIOD you have to rethink what is the university for no droning on at the chalkboard .PERIOD everyone lives together in this hotel ,COMMA -- ,COMMA lecturers and students -- .PERIOD and it's not surprising at all to find an impromptu tutorial at 1 .PERIOD am we ,COMMA especially emphasize areas of great relevance to africa's development ?QUESTIONMARK because in those areas scientists working in africa will have a competitive advantage .PERIOD they'll publish be invited to conferences and aims has done extremely well .PERIOD five students can be educated at aims for the cost of educating one in the us or europe .PERIOD she communicates well with the immunologists at the hospital .PERIOD here are the current students at aims .PERIOD there are 53 of them from 20 different countries ,COMMA including 20 women .PERIOD so now i'm going to get to my ted business .PERIOD i want to point out a few other ,COMMA exceptional people in this picture .PERIOD and she's now at aims .PERIOD and our wish has two parts .PERIOD one is a dream and the other's a plan .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK our ted dream is that the next einstein will be african .PERIOD we want to add entrepreneurship and policy skills .PERIOD over the last year .PERIOD we've been visiting sites in africa ,COMMA looking at potential sites for new aims centers .PERIOD so we have political support right across the continent .PERIOD but nobody was really worried about this .PERIOD this is a quote ,COMMA actually from alan turing in 30 years .PERIOD it will be as easy to ask a computer a question as to ask a person .PERIOD this was in 1946 .PERIOD and now in 2007 ,COMMA it's still not true .PERIOD that's how much power this computer uses .PERIOD rory is a graduate student at stanford .PERIOD i estimate 10 to the 16 bits per second ,COMMA which is actually about very similar to what blue gene does .PERIOD and let me just summarize .PERIOD so the bottom line ,COMMA the brain processes information using 100000 times less energy than we do right now with this computer technology that we have .PERIOD so this clip is from the pbs series ,COMMA the secret life of the brain .PERIOD and that's basically what's going on in your brain right now ,COMMA as you're watching this ,COMMA the devices that computers use are what's called a transistor .PERIOD your computer uses this presence of current to represent a one and the absence of current to represent a zero .PERIOD but when it's open ,COMMA because these ions have to line up and flow through one at a time ,COMMA you get a kind of sporadic ,COMMA not steady -- .PERIOD it's a sporadic flow of current .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA there's about 12 .PERIOD electrons can all be flowing this way .PERIOD what you see here is that there's these redundant connections .PERIOD this is kareem's dark eyes .PERIOD and that's the white background that you see here .PERIOD so we are really duplicating the kind of signals that you have on the optic nerve .PERIOD let me just end by saying that this is what happens when you put africa in a piano .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK and i had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it .PERIOD i'm interested in finding ,COMMA whether or not there is a really massive what we like to call supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy .PERIOD but today ,COMMA the way i want you to understand a black hole for the proof of a black hole is to think of it as an object whose mass is confined to zero volume .PERIOD so why is it so important ?QUESTIONMARK now ,COMMA the key here is to figure out what that schwarzschild radius is .PERIOD it depends only on the mass of the object .PERIOD there are big ones there are little ones .PERIOD and there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy .PERIOD just to give you a sense of scale .PERIOD so at the center there ,COMMA that's actually where most of the starlight comes out from .PERIOD so you can't see the black hole itself ,COMMA but you can convert the gravitational energy of the black hole into the light .PERIOD we see .PERIOD and if there is a supermassive black hole ,COMMA what we need to assume is that it's a black hole on a diet ,COMMA and we live in the middle of it .PERIOD so when we look towards the center ,COMMA we see this plane ,COMMA which defines the plane of the galaxy or line that defines the plane of the galaxy .PERIOD it's the gravitational pull that makes these things orbit .PERIOD so this is great ,COMMA because remember ,COMMA my job is to show there is a lot of mass inside a small volume .PERIOD so i want to see the stars that are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible .PERIOD because i want to show there is a mass inside as small ,COMMA a region as possible .PERIOD and that buys us about a factor of 20 .PERIOD so without this technology ,COMMA you can't see the stars .PERIOD and this one ,COMMA this one goes around in a human lifetime .PERIOD and the truth is ,COMMA i'm not quite there ,COMMA but we actually have no alternative today to explaining this concentration of mass .PERIOD likewise ,COMMA for the young stars .PERIOD or in contrast ,COMMA the young stars .PERIOD they just should not be there using observations .PERIOD that are not the ones i've shown you today .PERIOD we can actually figure out which ones are old ,COMMA and which ones are young the old ones are red .PERIOD he didn't read a note ,COMMA and he was profoundly hearing impaired .PERIOD and the thing about classical music that what and how it's inexhaustible and a tough slouchy kid got up to bat .PERIOD and he took a swing and really connected brah dada dadadadah ,COMMA and whether we call them 440 per second ,COMMA a or 3729 b ,COMMA flat -- trust me .PERIOD that's right -- .PERIOD they're just phenomena .PERIOD and in the 17th century ,COMMA it was more like this .PERIOD and there began to be a real difference at this point between the art of improvisation and the art of composition .PERIOD so in the first eight centuries ,COMMA or so of this tradition ,COMMA the big 'what' was to praise god .PERIOD the 'how' was a style called polyphony music of many independently ,COMMA moving voices .PERIOD that suggested the way the planets seemed to move in ptolemy's geocentric universe .PERIOD ah ,COMMA avaricious ,COMMA heaven and the chords .PERIOD it turned out were capable of representing incredible varieties of emotions .PERIOD it's just these two notes in the middle ,COMMA and it turned out the symphony could be used for more complex issues ,COMMA like gripping ones of culture ,COMMA such as nationalism or quest for freedom ,COMMA or the frontiers of sensuality .PERIOD what happens when the music stops ?QUESTIONMARK where does it go ?QUESTIONMARK what's left ?QUESTIONMARK it's the passing on part .PERIOD it's the 'why' part of it at the same time technology by taking over the role that notation had always played shifted the balance within music between instinct and intelligence way over to the instinctive side .PERIOD what's the long-term effect of this on us ?QUESTIONMARK or on music ?QUESTIONMARK nobody knows there's just a role here for so many people -- teachers ,COMMA parents ,COMMA performers -- to be explorers together .PERIOD you can start anywhere ramble a bit .PERIOD then these two fellows came along ,COMMA and they were flying kites to develop the control systems that would ultimately enable powered human flight .PERIOD but unfortunately ,COMMA it relegated kites once again ,COMMA to be considered children's toys .PERIOD and it doesn't hurt to do it in a location like this either .PERIOD if you'd loan me your gulfstream ,COMMA i'll rip its wings off and generate you a megawatt .PERIOD the story starts with just a single person ,COMMA a child ,COMMA behaving a little strangely .PERIOD they're creating the ecosystem from which innovation emerges .PERIOD it's based on hundreds of hours of research of practice .PERIOD now ,COMMA here's an example :COLON -- pre-internet -- of this machine in action .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA you might just be a kid with a webcam .PERIOD but if you can do something that goes viral ,COMMA you get to be seen by the equivalent of sports stadiums crammed with people .PERIOD and even if it's not that eloquent -- ,COMMA and it's not -- ,COMMA it can still really make your day .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA my colleague ,COMMA june cohen has taken to calling it radical openness because it works for us each time by giving away our tedx brand .PERIOD we suddenly have a thousand-plus live experiments in the art of spreading ideas .PERIOD we're a social species ,COMMA and that's why what i'm excited about .PERIOD and what i think is under-reported is the significance of the rise of online video .PERIOD he's a unicyclist .PERIOD jove is a website that was founded to encourage scientists to publish their peer-reviewed research on video .PERIOD why do people like watching tedtalks 500 years ago ?QUESTIONMARK it ran into a competitor with a lethal advantage .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA today ,COMMA one person speaking can be seen by millions ,COMMA shedding bright light on potent ideas ,COMMA creating intense desire for learning and to respond -- .PERIOD and in his case ,COMMA intense desire to laugh ,COMMA thousands of people are figuring out new ways to learn and crucially to respond completing the cycle .PERIOD and so ,COMMA as we've thought about this ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's become clear to us what the next stage of ted's evolution has to be .PERIOD they used the same trash to form green manure .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD the name abegg -- abegg is actually a-b-e-g-g .PERIOD and that's the main theme in the melody .PERIOD what i do first is ,COMMA i make a lot of little musical ideas -- .PERIOD you can just improvise here at the piano -- .PERIOD and i choose one of those to become my main theme ,COMMA my main melody ,COMMA like the abegg that you just heard .PERIOD so for inspiration ,COMMA i listened to liszt and tchaikovsky and all the great romantic composers .PERIOD and once i realized it ,COMMA there's a parallel between creating music and creating art ,COMMA because for your motive or your little initial idea for your drawing .PERIOD it's your character -- .PERIOD you want to decide who do you want to draw ?QUESTIONMARK or if you want to draw an original character like am i going to use one page ?QUESTIONMARK am i going to use a two-page spread like a comic book for more grandiose effect .PERIOD i guess ,COMMA instead ,COMMA i'd like to try something called improvisation ,COMMA and that's a huge amount of data ,COMMA and the more technical topics ,COMMA such as architecture materials and strangely enough men .PERIOD those are not good topics to talk about ingenious tedtalks ,COMMA much more this green color ,COMMA etc .PERIOD et .PERIOD now since this is tedactive ,COMMA and i learned from my analysis that i should actually give you something .PERIOD i will not impose the ultimate or worst tedtalk on you ,COMMA but rather give you a tool to create your own .PERIOD and i call this tool ,COMMA the tedpad .PERIOD thank you very much .PERIOD now ,COMMA if you combine this very simple ,COMMA very conservative thought ,COMMA -- go with the grain of human nature ,COMMA -- with all the advances in behavioral economics ,COMMA some of which we were just hearing about again .PERIOD i think we can achieve a real increase in well-being in happiness in a stronger society ,COMMA without necessarily having to spend a whole lot more money .PERIOD well ,COMMA i can't in the time .PERIOD i've got give huge numbers of examples ,COMMA but let me just give a few of the ways that life can change .PERIOD and this is so obvious in a way ,COMMA because you think about how all of you have changed the way we shop the way .PERIOD we travel the way that business is done .PERIOD we want to get people to be more energy efficient .PERIOD obviously ,COMMA here we have jfk with that incredibly simple and powerful formulation ,COMMA ask not what your country can do for .PERIOD you ask what you can do for your country ,COMMA an incredibly noble sentiment .PERIOD but when he made that speech ,COMMA what could you do to build the stronger better society ?QUESTIONMARK and i think an even more wonderful speech ,COMMA which i'm going to read a big chunk of which sums up what i said at the beginning about believing there is more to life than money and more that we should try and measure than money ,COMMA some say up to five tons .PERIOD they're fantastic creatures .PERIOD so they were incredibly important animals .PERIOD the importance of basking sharks to the coast communities is recognized through the language .PERIOD and most of what we do know is based on their habit of coming to the surface ,COMMA and we try to guess what they're doing from their behavior on the surface ,COMMA and we tagged them very simply ,COMMA not very hi-tech with a big long pole .PERIOD and of course ,COMMA sharks fish are underwater most of the time .PERIOD and here's a couple of maps that we've done that one .PERIOD you can see that we tagged both off kerry .PERIOD so he did another study using microsatellites ,COMMA which are much more expensive ,COMMA much more time ,COMMA consuming and to his surprise came up with almost identical results .PERIOD and it's thought ,COMMA maybe it was a bottleneck ,COMMA a genetic bottleneck thought to be 12000 years ago .PERIOD and this has caused a very low diversity ,COMMA but the average of all ,COMMA these studies came out -- .PERIOD the mean is about 5000 ,COMMA which i personally don't believe .PERIOD but then i am a skeptic .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA of those 20000 8000 were thought to be females .PERIOD they didn't get enough samples to really explore the genetics in enough detail ,COMMA and some are caught in nets in trawls .PERIOD and in about half an hour ,COMMA we got five samples .PERIOD five individual sharks were sampled using simon's shark slime sampling system .PERIOD and i was thinking of humpback whales ,COMMA breaching and dolphins .PERIOD and what you're trying to look at is the males have claspers ,COMMA which kind of dangle out behind the back of the shark .PERIOD and you just want to learn as much as you can ,COMMA as soon as you can philosophers ,COMMA dramatists theologians have grappled with this question for centuries ,COMMA what makes people go wrong ?QUESTIONMARK so when i read robert louis stevenson that wasn't fiction ,COMMA and apparently he disobeyed god .PERIOD and that's the ultimate disobedience to authority .PERIOD i became an expert witness for one of the guards sergeant chip frederick .PERIOD and in that position ,COMMA i had access to the dozen investigative reports .PERIOD i had access to him .PERIOD i could study him have him come to my home ,COMMA get to know him do psychological analysis to see was he a good apple or bad apple ?QUESTIONMARK why tier 1-a was the center for military intelligence ?QUESTIONMARK that's one of the visual illustrations of evil ,COMMA who are the bad apples ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA that's a bad question .PERIOD and so we're interested in what are the external factors around the individual -- ,COMMA the bad barrel and social scientists ,COMMA stop there ?QUESTIONMARK and they miss the big point that i discovered when i became an expert witness for abu ghraib .PERIOD this is stanley .PERIOD milgram little jewish kid from the bronx .PERIOD and he asked the question could the holocaust happen here ?QUESTIONMARK now ,COMMA he gets tied up to the shock apparatus in another room .PERIOD and so he's the modern lucifer effect ,COMMA a man of god ,COMMA who becomes the angel of death .PERIOD it was a real cop car .PERIOD it was a real policeman .PERIOD and there were real neighbors in the street who didn't know that this was an experiment .PERIOD do they kill torture ,COMMA mutilate 13 .PERIOD if you give people power without oversight ,COMMA it's a prescription for abuse .PERIOD they knew that .PERIOD and let that happen .PERIOD the answer is nobody .PERIOD and i think nobody on purpose .PERIOD banality of heroism is ,COMMA it's ordinary people who do heroic deeds .PERIOD he was a low-level private ,COMMA and that stopped it was he a hero .PERIOD no ,COMMA she came down saw that madhouse and said ,COMMA you know what ?QUESTIONMARK it's terrible ,COMMA what you're doing to those boys .PERIOD so ,COMMA the psychology of heroism is -- .PERIOD we're going to end in a moment -- .PERIOD how do we encourage children in new hero courses that i'm working with ?QUESTIONMARK matt langdon -- .PERIOD he has a hero workshop -- to develop this heroic imagination .PERIOD this self-labeling ,COMMA i am a hero in waiting and teach them skills wesley .PERIOD and the guy -- 20 and a half inches height .PERIOD a half an inch would have taken his head off .PERIOD take path one .PERIOD you're going to be a perpetrator of evil path .PERIOD two .PERIOD you become guilty of the evil of passive inaction .PERIOD we should ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA because without having this possibility of conscious minds ,COMMA we would have no knowledge whatsoever about our humanity .PERIOD we would have no knowledge whatsoever about the world so much for the wonder .PERIOD now for the mystery .PERIOD and in that image there ,COMMA you see a variety of islands of what i call image-making regions in the brain .PERIOD you have the green ,COMMA for example ,COMMA that corresponds to tactile information or the blue that corresponds to auditory information .PERIOD but what about the self ?QUESTIONMARK and for a long time ,COMMA people did not even want to touch it ,COMMA because they'd say ,COMMA how can you have this reference point this stability that is required to maintain the continuity of selves day after day ?QUESTIONMARK i like to call it an almost infinite sameness from day to day .PERIOD there is the brain stem in between the cerebral cortex and the spinal cord .PERIOD it developed in collectives of human beings .PERIOD why care if it is the brain stem or the cerebral cortex and how this is made ?QUESTIONMARK and if we are interested ,COMMA for example ,COMMA in the fact that anti-gravity is pulling galaxies away from the earth .PERIOD why should we not be interested in ?QUESTIONMARK what is going on inside of human beings ?QUESTIONMARK when i was just a little girl ?QUESTIONMARK my mom started ,COMMA what is now the longest-running women's film festival in the world fishnet stockings .PERIOD i thought they were really hot .PERIOD there are lots of very modern political movements that have caught fire in no small part because of cultural hipness .PERIOD and one of our biggest successes is we get mail from teenage girls in the middle of iowa who say ,COMMA i googled ,COMMA jessica simpson and stumbled on your site .PERIOD we don't want one face .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD it's enough to make you feel very overwhelmed ,COMMA which brings me to my third paradox .PERIOD you may have guessed by now .PERIOD i did not light myself on fire .PERIOD cornel west says ,COMMA of course ,COMMA it's a failure .PERIOD she was talking about board meetings .PERIOD she was founding peace organizations .PERIOD she was coordinating carpools .PERIOD she was consoling friends ,COMMA -- ,COMMA all these daily acts of care and creativity .PERIOD and surely ,COMMA at three and four years old ,COMMA i was listening to the soothing sound of her voice .PERIOD but i think i was also getting my first lesson in activist ,COMMA work know thyself .PERIOD and we feel like we have to get far far away to a secluded retreat ,COMMA leaving it all behind .PERIOD this is the term that armies use when they've lost a battle .PERIOD you may or may not have noticed that i'm wearing a tiny electrode on my forehead .PERIOD let me show you what it looks like ,COMMA or what if i can take that information and put it into an organic shape up on the screen .PERIOD i may also be interested in knowing how focused i am .PERIOD so i can put my level of attention into the circuit board on the other side .PERIOD and that was responsiveness .PERIOD we then realized that if technology could know something about you and use it to help you ,COMMA there's an even more valuable application than that .PERIOD in the original zen bound game ,COMMA you play it by scrolling your fingers over the pad .PERIOD you have graphs and charts that tell you how your brain was doing -- ,COMMA not just how much rope you used or what your high score is .PERIOD but what was going on inside of your mind ,COMMA the way these children will be able to use their new awareness to improve themselves ,COMMA will upend many of the damaging and widespread social stigmas that people who are diagnosed as different are challenged with .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD so i used to get my eyes tested just for fun .PERIOD so let me just tell you the great part of all of this .PERIOD and so when i heard that eye specialist ,COMMA tell me all the things ,COMMA a big fat ,COMMA no ,COMMA everybody imagines .PERIOD i was devastated .PERIOD the first thing i thought about was my mom who was crying over beside me .PERIOD and that wind in my face made me believe that he was mad .PERIOD and i would drive ,COMMA oh ,COMMA for the love of god ,COMMA i just was so -- .PERIOD how do i tell him ?QUESTIONMARK and then he said to me ,COMMA what did you want to be when you were little ?QUESTIONMARK i know this run so well ,COMMA by the back of my hand ,COMMA i count the steps and the lampposts and all those things that visually impaired .PERIOD people have a tendency to have a lot of meetings with .PERIOD and you know ,COMMA the extraordinary part of it is ,COMMA i just simply had no answers ,COMMA and nobody can tell me ,COMMA no ,COMMA yes ,COMMA you can say ,COMMA i can't be an archeologist .PERIOD i'm going to go across india on the back of an elephant ,COMMA and i never thought about noes anymore ,COMMA or not seeing ,COMMA or any of that kind of nothing .PERIOD and consequently ,COMMA we can see the result all around us .PERIOD i hope it's not the curb cut between the chuck e cheese and the target store ,COMMA because that's not good enough for americans to be spilling their blood for this is the other side of the building .PERIOD and what is the message that is coming ?QUESTIONMARK what are the vocabularies and grammars that are coming from this building ?QUESTIONMARK and how is it informing us about who we are ?QUESTIONMARK you know ,COMMA this is a building designed like a dvd player .PERIOD anyway .PERIOD this is how you compose and assemble a downtown business building .PERIOD and this is what happened when in glens falls new york ,COMMA when we tried to do it again ,COMMA where it was missing right ?QUESTIONMARK and that starts to be delivered in the form of the railroad suburb the country villa along the railroad line ,COMMA which allows people to enjoy the amenity of the city ,COMMA but to return to the countryside every night .PERIOD and that's the great non-articulated agony of suburbia .PERIOD and one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule .PERIOD i don't have any eyes on the side of my head .PERIOD i can't see .PERIOD so they take the first one that comes along .PERIOD often .PERIOD we're going to have to do something else instead so that you know ,COMMA the residences make sense deployed in relation to the places of business of culture and of governance ,COMMA the dead malls .PERIOD what are we going to do with them ?QUESTIONMARK no amount ,COMMA or combination of alternative fuels is going to allow us to continue running what we're running the way .PERIOD we're running it .PERIOD we're going to have to do everything very differently and america's not prepared .PERIOD and within that context ,COMMA we can offer the kids time -- something that seems in short supply in their over-scheduled lives .PERIOD all materials are available for use .PERIOD it's a great honor today to share with you the digital universe ,COMMA which was created for humanity to really see where we are in the universe .PERIOD nasa supported this work 12 years ago ,COMMA as part of the rebuilding of the hayden planetarium ,COMMA so that we would share this with the world .PERIOD i captured this live from my laptop in a cafe called earth matters on the lower east side of manhattan ,COMMA where i live .PERIOD and it was done as a collaborative project with the rubin museum of himalayan art for an exhibit on comparative cosmology .PERIOD but this our containment of the visible universe ,COMMA this map can be updated ,COMMA and we can add in new data .PERIOD we have a growing user base of this .PERIOD and we network domes .PERIOD so you're seeing the edge of the earth .PERIOD this is nepal and tibet .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD so he figures out a way to download himself into his environment ,COMMA actually into a series of books .PERIOD i think that this is the future of interface .PERIOD it's the future of music ,COMMA the future of instruments .PERIOD and i'll let adam tell you .PERIOD so adam is a phd student at mit ,COMMA an expert in music ,COMMA technology and medicine and adam and dan have become close collaborators .PERIOD adam boulanger ,COMMA yes .PERIOD so tod .PERIOD and i entered into a discussion following the tewksbury work .PERIOD and it was really about how dan is an expressive person ,COMMA and he's an intelligent and creative person ,COMMA and it's in his face .PERIOD it's in his breathing .PERIOD it's in his eyes .PERIOD how come he can't perform one of his pieces of music .PERIOD that's our responsibility .PERIOD and it doesn't make sense .PERIOD but what about expression ?QUESTIONMARK what about that moment ?QUESTIONMARK when an artist delivers that piece of work ,COMMA you know ,COMMA do our technologies allow us to express .PERIOD so let's do it .PERIOD so dan do you want to tell everyone about what you're going to play now ?QUESTIONMARK so he can go in hyperscore .PERIOD you start out by making melodies and rhythms .PERIOD he can place those exactly where he wants .PERIOD but instead of making it very literal showing you exactly the camera ,COMMA tracing ,COMMA we turned it into a graphic .PERIOD that shows you the basic movement and shows the way it's being analyzed .PERIOD yeah .PERIOD and these women sing an enchanting song ,COMMA a song ,COMMA so alluring that all sailors ,COMMA who hear it crash into the rocks and die .PERIOD i want to hear that song .PERIOD untie me .PERIOD there is first the present self .PERIOD well ,COMMA resisting temptation is hard as the 19th century .PERIOD english economist ,COMMA nassau .PERIOD william senior said to abstain from the enjoyment ,COMMA which is in our power ,COMMA or to seek distant ,COMMA rather than immediate results are among the most painful exertions of the human will .PERIOD so the first is ,COMMA when you've got one of these devices going such as this contract to write everyday or pay ,COMMA it's just a constant reminder that you have no self-control .PERIOD the other problem with commitment devices is that you can always weasel your way out of them .PERIOD and this is a timely issue .PERIOD and we're at a situation now ,COMMA where ,COMMA for every three baby boomers ,COMMA the mckinsey global institute predicts that two will not be able to meet their pre-retirement needs while they're in retirement .PERIOD he said that we might neglect our future selves because of some failure of belief or imagination ,COMMA when you make an investment ,COMMA what you're really saying is ,COMMA i accept that any one of these 100 things could happen to me and determine my wealth .PERIOD once you find an investment that you're happy with .PERIOD what people do is ,COMMA they click done .PERIOD and the markers begin to disappear slowly one .PERIOD by one ,COMMA if you save very little ,COMMA the future self is unhappy living on 44 percent of the income .PERIOD and what's nice about it is ,COMMA it's not something that biasing people actually ,COMMA because as one face smiles the other face frowns ,COMMA there are programs .PERIOD you can get to see how people might look if they smoke ,COMMA if they get too much exposure to the sun ,COMMA if they gain weight and so on .PERIOD hal is here .PERIOD so i think we owe it to him as well as yourself to disabuse .PERIOD you of that last image ,COMMA i began my life as a markets professional and continued to take an interest .PERIOD but most of my recent effort has been looking at the value of what comes to human beings from nature ,COMMA and which doesn't get priced by the markets .PERIOD and the answer is ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA it can biodiversity the living fabric of this planet is not a gas .PERIOD and if you look at the species level ,COMMA you saw about fish and at this rate at which we are losing fish ,COMMA it is a human problem of enormous dimensions ,COMMA a health problem of a kind we haven't seen before .PERIOD the green represents the percentage .PERIOD the reason this is happening boils down in my mind to one basic problem ,COMMA which is our inability to perceive the difference between public benefits and private profits .PERIOD we tend to constantly ignore public wealth simply because it is in the common wealth .PERIOD it's common goods ;SEMICOLON it causes pollutants being issued ,COMMA which have an economic cost ,COMMA health cost .PERIOD and so on .PERIOD when we measure gdp as a measure of economic performance at the national level ,COMMA we don't include our biggest asset at the country level .PERIOD when we measure corporate performances ,COMMA we don't include our impacts on nature ,COMMA and what our business costs society that has to stop .PERIOD so clearly ,COMMA there was a problem with deforestation ,COMMA and i couldn't answer because ,COMMA neither of these companies good ,COMMA though they are and professional ,COMMA though they are do not calculate or disclose their externalities .PERIOD that's an example .PERIOD i think ,COMMA for us to look at and for us to draw comfort from if more companies did this .PERIOD and if more sectors engaged this as sectors ,COMMA you could have analysts business analysts .PERIOD and you could have people like us and consumers and ngos ,COMMA actually ,COMMA look .PERIOD and compare the social performance of companies has already set up a coalition to do this ,COMMA an international coalition a bit like inflation ,COMMA you over-issue currency ,COMMA you get what you see declining prices .PERIOD so ,COMMA in selecting targets of 450 parts per million and selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations ,COMMA what we have done is we've made an ethical choice .PERIOD i decided when i was asked to do this that what i really wanted to talk about was my friend richard feynman .PERIOD richard feynman was a very complex man .PERIOD he was a man of many ,COMMA many parts .PERIOD it may still exist .PERIOD i don't know ,COMMA but it was really brutal .PERIOD but the amazing thing was -- .PERIOD feynman had to leave a little early .PERIOD sometimes i would win mostly he would win ,COMMA but we both enjoyed them .PERIOD and he said ,COMMA leonardo were you closer to your mother or to you father when you were a kid being dick .PERIOD he of course ,COMMA wanted to check this .PERIOD there .PERIOD went that theory down the trashcan of history .PERIOD but let me tell you a little bit about feynman .PERIOD the physicist he would try to visualize it guided by a small number of simple principles .PERIOD it was so simple .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA that i suspect a really smart high school student ,COMMA who didn't even have calculus could understand what he wrote down .PERIOD you simply take the proton ,COMMA and you hit it really sharply with an electron .PERIOD so i think i'll just finish up by saying ,COMMA i actually don't think feynman would have liked this event .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD when this trailer showed up at my shop in berkeley ,COMMA i'd actually never stepped foot in an airstream trailer ,COMMA or any other trailer i decided i had to do some research and really figure out what had gone wrong somewhere along the history of airstream .PERIOD there's no such things as two walls and a ceiling coming together ,COMMA where you can change materials and shapes .PERIOD that's the trailer pretty much finished .PERIOD i thought ,COMMA finally ,COMMA oh yeah ,COMMA great big company .PERIOD i'm gonna work with somebody with money for tooling and molding .PERIOD welcome to five dangerous things .PERIOD you should let your children .PERIOD do .PERIOD we put warnings on coffee cups to tell us that the contents may be hot .PERIOD so where does this trend ?QUESTIONMARK stop ?QUESTIONMARK and yeah ,COMMA they're going to cut themselves .PERIOD so practicing ,COMMA throwing things has been shown to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobes ,COMMA which have to do with visual acuity ,COMMA 3d understanding and structural problem solving .PERIOD so it gives a sense -- .PERIOD it helps develop their visualization skills and their predictive ability .PERIOD number four ,COMMA -- ,COMMA deconstruct appliances ,COMMA and it's fun for the whole family .PERIOD narrator :COLON we are all aware of the risk of cancer ,COMMA but there's another disease that's destined to affect even more of us .PERIOD arthritis .PERIOD this is the field of biologic replacements where we replace worn-out parts with new natural ones ,COMMA and it works not just for my wife ,COMMA but certainly for other patients .PERIOD and so that's not going to be a solution .PERIOD that's going to get us global with biologic tissue .PERIOD how are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement ?QUESTIONMARK the space age began 50 years ago in october and that’s exactly what sputnik looked like .PERIOD they would bring them back and mount them .PERIOD so that’s for fun ,COMMA you can see how portable and handy it was to have your own guttenberg in 1455 in 1455 .PERIOD nobody could read .PERIOD but why is this so interesting here’s ,COMMA the quick story ?QUESTIONMARK that is why the printing press succeeded .PERIOD and that is why martin luther nailed his 90 theses to the door ,COMMA because he was complaining that the catholic church had gone amok in printing out indulgences and selling them in every town and village and city in all of western europe .PERIOD instead of showing an object from the stage i’m going to do something special for the first time we are going to show actually what the library looks like .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK and all throughout the library are different objects ,COMMA different spaces .PERIOD and yet ,COMMA looking at them ,COMMA you would see a machine and a molecule .PERIOD and what does a lump of coal have to do with the internet ?QUESTIONMARK what that means is a 200-megabyte file looks like this .PERIOD ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA ok ,COMMA the ego is not supposed to be involved in graphic design .PERIOD so then i can add some color in with the background and add a bit more color in with the words themselves .PERIOD and this way working with the art director ,COMMA i'm able to bring it to just the right point that it's puzzling for the audience -- .PERIOD they can figure out that .PERIOD there's something they have to read -- ,COMMA but it's not impossible for them to read .PERIOD so i'm currently working on a book ,COMMA which plays with both senses of the word ,COMMA as i explore some of my own ideas and inquiries in a visual display of rather peacock-like grandeur .PERIOD i've been sending out valentines on a fairly large scale since 2005 .PERIOD there's a longer story to this ,COMMA but i did get them all done in time .PERIOD and they were extremely well received .PERIOD i got an almost 100 percent response rate .PERIOD i had this idea that i wanted people to receive a kind of mysterious love letter like a found fragment in their mailbox .PERIOD and i specifically wrote four pages that don't connect .PERIOD i'm certain i can see you blushing .PERIOD so i solicited friends to send me their used christmas cards .PERIOD and i made 500 of these .PERIOD what does it say ?QUESTIONMARK so that's why i do what i do and why i spend so much time and effort on it .PERIOD and why i work in the commercial public sphere ,COMMA as opposed to the isolated ,COMMA private sphere of fine art ,COMMA because i want as many people as possible to see my work .PERIOD notice it be drawn into it and be able to take something from it .PERIOD and i actually really feel that it's worthwhile to spend my valuable and limited time on this earth in this way .PERIOD and i thank you for allowing me to show it to you .PERIOD the main characteristics of such a system is that there's one sole contact point to the ground .PERIOD he's now keeping a constant distance to thomas .PERIOD and of course ,COMMA who wouldn't like to take a ride on one of these .PERIOD and i say ,COMMA what is the light bulb ?QUESTIONMARK good for even when you're standing in front of a megaphone ,COMMA it's pretty much every direction .PERIOD i got this waterfall .PERIOD i recorded in my back yard ,COMMA you have to be kind of smart .PERIOD and though i did not graduate from college ,COMMA doesn't mean i'm stupid because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today .PERIOD we're just starting to really discover the laws of nature and science and physics .PERIOD i have been really lucky with this technology .PERIOD all of a sudden ,COMMA as it is ready .PERIOD the world is ready to accept it .PERIOD this unit that i played goes from about 200 hertz to above the range of hearing .PERIOD it's actually emitting ultrasound ,COMMA -- low-level ,COMMA ultrasound -- .PERIOD that's about 100000 vibrations per second .PERIOD and the sound that you're hearing ,COMMA unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face is made out in front of it in the air ,COMMA or you can whisper in the ear of a supposed terrorist ,COMMA some biblical verse .PERIOD we put it on a turret with a camera so that when they shoot at you ,COMMA you're over there .PERIOD and it's there .PERIOD i took it back to the pentagon after it got declassified when the patent issued and told the people back there about it and they laughed .PERIOD and then i took them back a demo and they bought .PERIOD so i've been really lucky as an inventor .PERIOD i've got a coke can opening .PERIOD that's right in your head .PERIOD that's really cool .PERIOD appreciate it very much .PERIOD i thought i would talk a little bit about how nature makes materials .PERIOD i've been fascinated by how nature makes materials .PERIOD and there's a lot of sequence to how they do such an exquisite job .PERIOD so that's the vision that i've been thinking about .PERIOD there's diatoms made out of sio2 ,COMMA and they're magnetotactic bacteria that make small single-domain magnets used for navigation .PERIOD and i was really fortunate to have president obama visit my lab this year on his visit to mit .PERIOD and i really wanted to give him a periodic table .PERIOD what if he says 'oh ,COMMA i already have one' or 'i've already ,COMMA memorized it' .PERIOD now ,COMMA if you take all billion viruses ,COMMA and you can put them in one drop of liquid ,COMMA you can force them to interact with anything .PERIOD you want on the periodic table .PERIOD so basically viruses can't replicate themselves .PERIOD they need a host .PERIOD and so through a process of selection ,COMMA evolution ,COMMA we went from being able to have a virus that made a crummy battery to a virus that made a good battery to a virus that made a record-breaking high-powered battery .PERIOD that's all made at room temperature .PERIOD basically at the bench top ,COMMA you can make lots of amplifications to it when you shine light on them ,COMMA you can see them bubbling .PERIOD in this case ,COMMA you're seeing oxygen bubbles .PERIOD come out .PERIOD the last example are solar cells .PERIOD and what we've found is through genetic engineering ,COMMA we can actually increase the efficiencies of these solar cells to record numbers for these types of dye-sensitized systems .PERIOD i'll hear things like an extra room in the house ,COMMA the basement the coffee shop ,COMMA the library .PERIOD and then you'll hear things like the train ,COMMA a plane ,COMMA a car -- .PERIOD so the commute ,COMMA why is that happening ?QUESTIONMARK you don't have a workday anymore .PERIOD you have work moments .PERIOD it's like the front door of the office is like a cuisinart .PERIOD and you walk in and your day is shredded to bits ,COMMA because you have 15 minutes here and 30 minutes there .PERIOD and then something else happens and you're pulled off your work .PERIOD and you've got to do something else .PERIOD then you have 20 minutes .PERIOD then it's lunch .PERIOD i sat at my desk .PERIOD i used my expensive computer .PERIOD you might have a quick idea ,COMMA but to be in deep thought about a problem .PERIOD and really consider a problem carefully .PERIOD you need long stretches of uninterrupted time .PERIOD now ,COMMA there are different kinds of distractions .PERIOD but there aren't the really bad kinds of distractions that i'll talk about in just a minute .PERIOD so sleep is about sleep phases or stages .PERIOD -- .PERIOD some people call them different things .PERIOD if you're interrupted and woken up ,COMMA you have to start again .PERIOD i don't think anyone would say ,COMMA yes ,COMMA they'll also say -- .PERIOD sometimes they'll also say ,COMMA well ,COMMA if i can't see the person ,COMMA how do i know they're working ,COMMA which is ridiculous ,COMMA of course .PERIOD but that's one of the excuses that managers give no one cared about letting people take a smoke break for 15 minutes 10 years ago .PERIOD so why does everyone care about someone going to facebook here ?QUESTIONMARK and there or twitter here ?QUESTIONMARK and there or youtube here ?QUESTIONMARK and there ,COMMA those are the real problems in the modern office today that's kind of bad .PERIOD and meetings are just toxic terrible ,COMMA poisonous things during the day at work .PERIOD what if they're doing important work ?QUESTIONMARK if there are 10 people in the meeting ,COMMA it's a 10-hour meeting .PERIOD it's not a one-hour meeting .PERIOD it's 10 hours of productivity taken from the rest of the organization to have this one one-hour meeting ,COMMA which probably should have been handled by two or three people talking for a few minutes .PERIOD these things don't exist outside of the office .PERIOD i have about three minutes ,COMMA so that'll fit perfectly .PERIOD i don't know if people still do that .PERIOD so just the afternoon ,COMMA one thursday ,COMMA this is when people actually get stuff done is when no one's bothering them when no one's interrupting them .PERIOD all these discussions and decisions you thought you had to make at this one time at 9 am on monday ,COMMA just forget about them ,COMMA and things will be just fine .PERIOD and i specialize in human behavioral research and applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways and to design for that future .PERIOD and it'll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that .PERIOD so this is interesting to us because the conscious and subconscious decision process implies that the stuff that you do take with you and end up using has some kind of spiritual emotional or functional value .PERIOD but if you ask people what the three most important things that they carry are -- across cultures and across gender and across contexts ,COMMA -- most people will say keys money .PERIOD and if they own one ,COMMA a mobile phone and a mobile phone ,COMMA it turns out is a great recovery tool ,COMMA but -- ,COMMA and it's a pretty big ,COMMA but -- ,COMMA we forget ,COMMA i think ,COMMA quite a nice feature .PERIOD and these things don't stay in the center of gravity .PERIOD but over time ,COMMA they gravitate there .PERIOD but the difference between this and that is ,COMMA there's no central authority trying to control this .PERIOD and ok ,COMMA if you break one of these things here ,COMMA you return it to the carrier .PERIOD they'll probably give you three new ones ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK it challenges ,COMMA the norms .PERIOD this is how it's shifting .PERIOD i'm just the messenger and companies like navigenics and dna ,COMMA direct and 23andme that are giving you your genetic .PERIOD profiles are giving some people a sense of gosh .PERIOD well ,COMMA what can i do about it ?QUESTIONMARK and so my request is please .PERIOD let's make technologies that make people more human and not less .PERIOD i made a lot of mistakes and dumb decisions ,COMMA of course .PERIOD so let's say ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA that you're on your way to your best friend's wedding .PERIOD and you're trying to get to the airport ,COMMA and you're stuck in terrible traffic .PERIOD and you finally arrive at your gate ,COMMA and you've missed your flight .PERIOD we wish we'd taken better advantage of the education that we did have odds are you're not going to care in five years .PERIOD it feels terrible ,COMMA regret ,COMMA feels awful .PERIOD and the thought was make it go away .PERIOD we just want it to vanish make it go away .PERIOD make it go away .PERIOD in point of fact ,COMMA no insurance covers acts of idiocy .PERIOD and the problem is that there are certain things that happen in life that we desperately want to change ,COMMA and we cannot .PERIOD but first ,COMMA i want to say that the intensity and persistence ,COMMA with which we experience these emotional components of regret is obviously going to vary depending on the specific thing that we're feeling regretful about the fda estimates that of all the americans who have tattoos 17 percent of us regret getting them .PERIOD now ,COMMA in my case ,COMMA this really wasn't a problem ,COMMA because it's actually very easy to laugh at yourself when you're 29 years old ,COMMA and you want your mommy because you don't like your new tattoo .PERIOD all right .PERIOD and what i loved about this image of the compass was that i felt like it encapsulated ,COMMA both of these ideas in one simple image ,COMMA even in wealthy countries .PERIOD it is common now to see inequality growing in the united states since 2001 ,COMMA we've had five years of economic growth .PERIOD five years of productivity growth in the workplace ,COMMA but median wages are stagnant .PERIOD and the percentage of working families dropping below the poverty line is up by four percent .PERIOD it is also unstable ,COMMA because primarily of the power of the internet .PERIOD people of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money that can change the world for some public good .PERIOD if they all agree ,COMMA you saw one reference to that in what we were able to do with aids drugs ,COMMA when i got out of office and was asked to work first in the caribbean to try to help deal with the aids crisis .PERIOD generic drugs were available for about 500 dollars a person a year .PERIOD we need a movie on those six categories .PERIOD and all of you need to have it embedded in your brains and to organize yourselves around it .PERIOD you think about whatever your life has been ,COMMA however ,COMMA many obstacles you have faced in your life at critical junctures .PERIOD you always knew there was a predictable connection between the effort you exerted .PERIOD and the result you achieved as poor as haiti is in the area where farmer's clinic is active -- ,COMMA and they serve a catchment area far greater than the medical professionals .PERIOD they have would indicate they could serve -- since 1988 .PERIOD they have not lost one person to tuberculosis ,COMMA not one .PERIOD we're essentially implementing .PERIOD what paul farmer did in haiti .PERIOD he develops and trains ,COMMA paid community health workers who are able to identify health problems ,COMMA ensure that people who have aids or tb are properly diagnosed and take their medicine regularly who work on ,COMMA bringing about health education ,COMMA clean water and sanitation ,COMMA providing nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of health care .PERIOD if they have problems of the severity that require it .PERIOD the procedures that make this work have been perfected ,COMMA as i said ,COMMA by paul farmer and his team in their work in rural haiti over the last 20 years .PERIOD and the results were so good that the rwandan government has now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country ,COMMA and has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it .PERIOD and then we have others working in these other related programs .PERIOD so she now works full-time on this for very little pay ,COMMA and not a single soul in this area was being treated for aids or tuberculosis listen to this less than four-tenths of one percent of those being treated stopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment .PERIOD we're now working with partners in health and the ministry of health in rwanda .PERIOD and our foundation folks to scale .PERIOD this system up ,COMMA we need initial upfront investment to train doctors ,COMMA nurses health administration and community health workers throughout the country to set up the information technology ,COMMA the solar energy ,COMMA the water and sanitation ,COMMA the transportation infrastructure .PERIOD i had a really hard time in school .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA my mother told me eventually that i was the little kid in the village who cried all the way to school .PERIOD i ran away .PERIOD and when the natural breeze isn't enough ,COMMA the kids deploy bubbles ,COMMA but not the kind of bubbles ,COMMA you know ,COMMA they know they can control their world landscaping .PERIOD they're part of the rice cycle .PERIOD and these skills will be valuable for them in their future .PERIOD the food is incredible green .PERIOD school is a place of pioneers ,COMMA local and global .PERIOD the kids are from 25 countries .PERIOD you practice ancient balinese arts ,COMMA the kids love it and together ,COMMA these volunteers ,COMMA and the teachers are deeply committed to creating a new generation of global green leaders .PERIOD the green school effect -- .PERIOD we don't know what it is .PERIOD and how did we do all this ?QUESTIONMARK it's a double helix from the time .PERIOD the foundations were finished in three months .PERIOD it had roofs and floors ,COMMA you ruined my life ,COMMA but you gave me an incredible future .PERIOD and then a third attempt ,COMMA which also patched me back together ,COMMA pretty well until it failed .PERIOD i tried out various computer voices that were available online .PERIOD and for several months ,COMMA i had a british accent ,COMMA which chaz called sir lawrence .PERIOD there are all sorts of html codes .PERIOD you can use to control the timing and inflection of computer voices .PERIOD and i've experimented with them ,COMMA but what value do we place on the sound of our own voice ?QUESTIONMARK but it wasn't that simple or roger 20 .PERIOD this is the first version of my computer voice .PERIOD when i read something ,COMMA it will read in my voice .PERIOD the voice was created by a company in scotland named cereproc .PERIOD i plan to use it on television radio and the internet people who need a voice should know that most computers already come with built-in speaking systems .PERIOD john hunter ,COMMA all my life .PERIOD i was a motormouth .PERIOD i doubt on that day 50 years ago ,COMMA they even dreamed of what salman khan has accomplished .PERIOD but that's not the point .PERIOD i have learned from wikipedia ,COMMA that starting with that humble beginning ,COMMA plato ,COMMA established forums message boards ,COMMA online testing email chat rooms ,COMMA picture languages instant messaging remote screen ,COMMA sharing and multiple-player games ,COMMA but online .PERIOD everybody speaks at the same speed .PERIOD ironic that my legs are fine .PERIOD and it's my shoulders that slow up my walk .PERIOD when you see me today

by cirque du soleil .PERIOD i wanted my artistic statement .PERIOD my interpretation of reality .PERIOD the secret is that we were treating the whole newspaper as one piece as one composition -- like music .PERIOD and design is responsible for this experience .PERIOD what really makes it amazing that the circulation of these newspapers were growing too same in poland ,COMMA plus 13 up to 35 percent ,COMMA raise of circulation .PERIOD after three years .PERIOD you can work for a small company in a boring branch .PERIOD so bear with me as i take you through this journey .PERIOD i was running across the street .PERIOD and the only thing that i actually remember is feeling like a grenade went off in my head .PERIOD and i remember putting my hands on the ground and feeling my life's blood ,COMMA emptying out of my neck .PERIOD and my mouth ,COMMA i had no idea what was going on ,COMMA but strangers intervened kept my heart moving beating .PERIOD i had lots of titanium put in me ,COMMA cadaver bones to try to get my feet moving the right way .PERIOD and i needed that wisdom at that moment in my life .PERIOD so they eventually started matching their talents and skills to all of my needs .PERIOD so they figured not being able to see is one thing ,COMMA but they need to get me to talk .PERIOD the redundancy was actually good for me .PERIOD so everything is different when you're a sighted person ,COMMA because you take that for granted .PERIOD we didn't have words like crowd-sourcing and radical collaboration .PERIOD when i had my accident ,COMMA a peasant ,COMMA who was walking to market that morning ran towards where the gunshot had come from and found a young man writhing in agony on the floor ,COMMA clearly shot by a dueling wound .PERIOD galois was taken to the local hospital where he died the next day in the arms of his brother .PERIOD and the last words he said to his brother were don't cry for me alfred ,COMMA but a few years earlier ,COMMA while still at school ,COMMA he'd actually cracked one of the big mathematical problems at the time .PERIOD symmetry can also help us to explain what's happening in the large hadron collider .PERIOD in cern ,COMMA artists ,COMMA too love to play around with symmetry .PERIOD here is thomas mann ,COMMA talking about symmetry in the magic mountain .PERIOD and the gateway ,COMMA you see behind has eight columns with beautiful symmetrical designs on them .PERIOD and i said to professor kurokawa ,COMMA wow .PERIOD the architects must have really been kicking themselves when they realized that they'd made a mistake and put this one upside down .PERIOD recently ,COMMA i took my family -- .PERIOD we do these rather kind of nerdy mathematical trips ,COMMA which my family love .PERIOD i think one of the problems about school mathematics is it doesn't look at how mathematics is embedded in the world we live in .PERIOD so they explored a more geometric art .PERIOD and the power of mathematics is often to change one thing into another to change geometry into language .PERIOD actually ,COMMA the invention of the number zero was a very modern concept ,COMMA seventh century ad by the indians .PERIOD i can reflect it in the line through x ,COMMA or the line ,COMMA through y ,COMMA or the line through z .PERIOD so both of these objects have six symmetries .PERIOD so the little table here records ,COMMA how the algebra of these symmetries work .PERIOD and this enables us to distinguish why the symmetries of these objects -- .PERIOD they both have six symmetries .PERIOD so why shouldn't we say they have the same symmetries and using those rules ,COMMA he was able to say that there are ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA only two objects with six symmetries and all the tiles match up again .PERIOD so there was a sixth of a turn ,COMMA a third of a turn where the z pieces meet .PERIOD how many symmetries does a rubik's cube have rather than you all shouting out .PERIOD i want you to count how many digits there are in that number okay ?QUESTIONMARK because this one ,COMMA i think there were a few here ,COMMA the people who just last sat down ,COMMA and i'd like to review ,COMMA just how unintended consequences play the part that they do .PERIOD but he did his best ,COMMA and he kept meticulous records that let him transform that branch of medicine .PERIOD so there were benefits in calamities -- benefits to pure science as well as to applied science and medicine .PERIOD there are two historians of business at the university of maryland brent goldfarb .PERIOD and david kirsch who have done some extremely interesting work much of it still unpublished on the history of major innovations .PERIOD they have combined the list of major innovations ,COMMA and they've discovered that the greatest number the greatest decade for fundamental innovations as reflected in all of the lists that others have made -- .PERIOD a number of lists that they have merged .PERIOD -- was the great depression .PERIOD so we see that sometimes as a result of these dislocations ,COMMA as a result of people ,COMMA leaving their original intended career and going into something else where their creativity could make a difference that depressions and all kinds of other unfortunate events can have a paradoxically stimulating effect on creativity .PERIOD we need to see what they can do for us .PERIOD it's kind of like a new approach to desktop computing .PERIOD and some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system .PERIOD also ,COMMA just like paper around our workspace .PERIOD we'll pin things up to the wall to remember them later .PERIOD and i can do the same thing here .PERIOD and you know ,COMMA you'll see post-it notes and things like that around people's offices .PERIOD so one thing we have for that is like a grid ,COMMA align kind of -- .PERIOD so you get that more traditional desktop .PERIOD things are kind of grid aligned .PERIOD the photo was made when we were deep in the valley over there .PERIOD but i think the point is that this is metaphor with teeth .PERIOD and it's with those teeth that i want to propose today that we rethink a little bit about the role of contemporary math -- ,COMMA not just financial math ,COMMA but math in general .PERIOD and he said ,COMMA it's funny .PERIOD you ask that because it's actually called black box trading .PERIOD there's a company in boston called nanex ,COMMA and they use math and magic .PERIOD and i don't know what ,COMMA and they reach into all the market data ,COMMA and they find actually sometimes some of these algorithms ,COMMA and when they find them ,COMMA they pull them out ,COMMA and they pin them to the wall like butterflies pragmatic chaos is like all of netflix algorithms ,COMMA trying to do the same thing .PERIOD pragmatic chaos like all netflix algorithms determines in the end ,COMMA 60 percent of what movies end up being rented ,COMMA wouldn't that be handy ?QUESTIONMARK and it uses what's called a bin-packing algorithm .PERIOD and this is really where the wires come right up into the city .PERIOD but before i dive into those ,COMMA i want to admit that i am an optimist .PERIOD and part of the reason i feel that way is looking at the past .PERIOD another statistic ,COMMA perhaps my favorite is to look at childhood deaths .PERIOD the next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again .PERIOD why ?QUESTIONMARK well there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths ,COMMA diarrhea ,COMMA pneumonia and malaria .PERIOD and the disease was all over the world .PERIOD and two tools helped bring the death rate down .PERIOD but malaria -- ,COMMA even the million deaths a year caused by malaria ,COMMA greatly understate its impact over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it .PERIOD and bed nets are a great tool .PERIOD so every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective .PERIOD it involves communicators to keep the funding high to keep the visibility high to tell the success stories .PERIOD it involves social scientists .PERIOD so we know how to get not just 70 percent of the people to use the bed nets ,COMMA but 90 percent .PERIOD it seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on ,COMMA and we'd understand very well .PERIOD let's start with why this is important .PERIOD not only has that been weak .PERIOD it's getting weaker .PERIOD and the answer is no ,COMMA but it in no way is associated with being a better teacher .PERIOD they have 66 schools ,COMMA -- ,COMMA mostly middle schools ,COMMA some high schools ,COMMA -- .PERIOD and what goes on is great teaching .PERIOD if you have a kid who's behind ,COMMA you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept .PERIOD i'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book .PERIOD i only have three minutes ,COMMA so i'm going to have to talk fast ,COMMA and it will use up your spare mental cycles .PERIOD so multitasking may be hard .PERIOD so it's logical that you'd have one there on the minor road entering the major .PERIOD and so the question is ,COMMA what does that cost us ?QUESTIONMARK that's just the gasoline cost .PERIOD there is also pollution wear on the car and time discount that back to the present ,COMMA at five percent over two million dollars for a stop sign in each direction .PERIOD now ,COMMA if you look at what that adjacent property is worth ,COMMA you could actually buy the property cut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line ,COMMA and then sell it off again .PERIOD and because we no longer need to use sunlight ,COMMA we have very specialized lights that are made for the operating room .PERIOD and this is what i think is the magic of fluorescence .PERIOD that's what the surgeon is saying in the operating room ,COMMA when the patient's on the table .PERIOD but then we actually don't know that it's all out ,COMMA and we wait .PERIOD so now you're faced with telling your patient first of all that they may need another surgery ,COMMA or that they need additional therapy ,COMMA such as radiation or chemotherapy .PERIOD so even if the tumor is not right on the surface ,COMMA you'll still be able to see it .PERIOD so if you're driving on the freeway and you want to know where's the next gas station ?QUESTIONMARK you have a map to tell you that that gas station is down the road .PERIOD so with our technology ,COMMA we can tell right away nerves if they are injured ,COMMA can cause paralysis ,COMMA can cause pain .PERIOD but you know what ?QUESTIONMARK these little nerves are so small in the context of prostate cancer that they are actually never seen .PERIOD people said ,COMMA we've been doing it this way for all these years ,COMMA but i went ahead anyway .PERIOD we have been able to see nerves for facial expression for facial movement for breathing -- .PERIOD every single nerve ,COMMA -- nerves for urinary function around the prostate .PERIOD i have patients who would benefit from this .PERIOD i think that this will result in my surgeries with a better outcome and fewer complications .PERIOD and this takes the long-term ,COMMA steady ,COMMA courage of the day-in day-out struggle to educate to persuade and to win acceptance .PERIOD and that is the light that i want to shine on health and medicine .PERIOD today ,COMMA they receive input from thousands of upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs ,COMMA which then if they pass a certain threshold will go to thousands of downstream partners if we could activate cells ,COMMA we could see what powers they can unleash what they can initiate and sustain .PERIOD now in the 20th century ,COMMA there was some hope that was generated through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders .PERIOD and while many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders ,COMMA practically none of them can be considered to be cured .PERIOD there's one other magic trick .PERIOD you need to make this all happen ,COMMA and that's the ability to get light into the brain .PERIOD so how do we do this ?QUESTIONMARK and one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear and over time -- ,COMMA in this case ,COMMA a mouse ,COMMA which is a good animal model ,COMMA commonly used in such experiments ,COMMA -- the animal learns to fear the tone .PERIOD the animal will react by freezing ,COMMA sort of like a deer in the headlights .PERIOD now i want to close on one story ,COMMA which we think is another possibility -- ,COMMA which is that maybe these molecules ,COMMA if you can do ultra-precise control can be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic .PERIOD an optical prosthetic ,COMMA maybe 100000 people have cochlear implants ,COMMA which allow them to hear and new hope in gene therapy has been developed because viruses like the adeno-associated virus ,COMMA which probably most of us around this room have .PERIOD and it doesn't have any symptoms ,COMMA which have been used in hundreds of patients to deliver genes into the brain or the body .PERIOD and the retina ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is a complex structure .PERIOD we're going to take these blue light photosensors and install them on a layer of cells in the middle of the retina ,COMMA in the back of the eye ,COMMA and convert them into a camera -- ,COMMA just like installing solar cells ,COMMA all over those neurons to make them light sensitive .PERIOD so this pre-clinical study ,COMMA i think bodes hope for the kinds of things we're hoping to do in the future ,COMMA and by turning things off ,COMMA it's more or less .PERIOD a zero does that mean that some day you could download memories ,COMMA and maybe upload them ,COMMA what determines the types and distributions of microbes indoors ?QUESTIONMARK and we looked at three different types of rooms ,COMMA hospitals use two and a half times the amount of energy as office buildings .PERIOD i've heard somebody say that you're as healthy as your gut .PERIOD and obviously ,COMMA i'm physically a very strong person as you can tell -- -- .PERIOD so i wasn't worried about carrying this thing .PERIOD 20 blocks people were out .PERIOD and i thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA this is the power of a city .PERIOD but the system itself of this city was thriving .PERIOD everybody contributes a little bit well ,COMMA it was the whole city .PERIOD so it's been a very optimistic time .PERIOD i think ,COMMA and i want to just talk about a few of those things that is -- .PERIOD you know ,COMMA there's no sentence that kind of conjures up that period better than that .PERIOD i think ,COMMA which is that ,COMMA you suddenly have the power to put up a picture of your dog and link to it .PERIOD and somebody reading the page has the power to click on that link ,COMMA or not click on that link .PERIOD but it's still a very one-to-one kind of relationship about two months ago .PERIOD i had the great breakthrough -- .PERIOD one of my great kind of shining achievements -- ,COMMA which is that my website finally became a top result for steven johnson .PERIOD and in fact ,COMMA i think that's not entirely true anymore that little list there would change .PERIOD that's not necessarily something .PERIOD we didn't know already .PERIOD i had no idea .PERIOD but what's interesting is ,COMMA you can then broaden the search and actually see interesting things and get a sense of what else is out there .PERIOD they're talking about slavery in 1860 .PERIOD and ok ,COMMA i didn't learn anything new there as well -- .PERIOD that's pretty obvious .PERIOD i'll go very quickly .PERIOD it's caused a lot of controversy ,COMMA because people thought that this was the ultimate kind of one man ,COMMA one modem democracy ,COMMA where anybody can get out there and get their voice heard .PERIOD and the question was were the birds singing well in my world .PERIOD this is a rubber duck .PERIOD that was a nice thing to get .PERIOD if the end game is global warming ,COMMA they're doing great .PERIOD so perhaps we could develop a strategy of change ,COMMA which requires humility ,COMMA and in my business ,COMMA as an architect ,COMMA it's unfortunate the word humility .PERIOD and the word architect have not appeared in the same paragraph .PERIOD since the fountainhead there is an infinite game .PERIOD and we're playing in that infinite game .PERIOD and so we call it cradle to cradle .PERIOD and our goal is very simple .PERIOD this is what i presented to the white house .PERIOD so we've designed products ,COMMA and we analyzed chemicals down to the parts per million .PERIOD we can ask ourselves ,COMMA what is justice and is justice blind ,COMMA or is justice ?QUESTIONMARK blindness is there anybody here who doesn't breathe ?QUESTIONMARK here's dr venkataswamy in india ,COMMA who's figured out how to do mass-produced health .PERIOD they become building steel .PERIOD my childhood summers were in the puget sound of washington among the first growth and big growth .PERIOD my grandfather had been a lumberjack in the olympics .PERIOD so i have a lot of tree karma .PERIOD i am working off .PERIOD so all of a sudden here i am graduating from high school in 1969 .PERIOD and this happens ,COMMA and we realize that away went away .PERIOD now ,COMMA if we look at the word competition ,COMMA i'm sure most of you've used it .PERIOD you know ,COMMA most people don't realize it comes from the latin competere ,COMMA which means strive together .PERIOD it means the way olympic athletes train with each other .PERIOD so we've been looking at the idea of competition as a way of cooperating in order to get fit together .PERIOD now ,COMMA most environmentalists don't say growth is good ,COMMA because in our lexicon ,COMMA asphalt is two words assigning blame technical nutrition will be in an order of magnitude of biological nutrition .PERIOD customers biotechnical nutrients -- ,COMMA the model u for ford motor ,COMMA a cradle to cradle car .PERIOD -- concept car .PERIOD the idea here of the car is that some of the materials go back to the industry forever .PERIOD some of the materials go back to soil -- .PERIOD it's all solar-powered .PERIOD we're doing 12 cities for china ,COMMA right now based on cradle to cradle as templates .PERIOD our assignment is to develop protocols for the housing for 400 million people in 12 years ,COMMA we start to integrate commercial and mixed use .PERIOD so the people all have centers and places to be .PERIOD and then it makes natural gas ,COMMA which then goes back into the city to power the fuel for the cooking for the city .PERIOD and then the compost is all taken back to the roofs of the city where we've got farming ,COMMA because what we've done is lifted up the city ,COMMA the landscape into the air to -- to restore the native landscape on the roofs of the buildings ,COMMA they're probably less cell dense .PERIOD and they're controlling basically everything that the nervous system has to do ,COMMA because what we're trying to measure the rna -- ,COMMA which is the readout from our genes .PERIOD -- is very labile .PERIOD and so we have to move very quickly ,COMMA and then the laser actually cuts .PERIOD now ,COMMA this may look like a bunch of dots to you ,COMMA but each one of these individual dots is actually a unique piece of the human genome that we spotted down on glass .PERIOD and when we take a sample and we hybridize it to it ,COMMA we get a unique fingerprint ,COMMA if you will quantitatively of what genes are turned on in that sample .PERIOD so roughly we have 50 million data points for a given human brain .PERIOD green is the sort of cool areas where it's not turned on genes ,COMMA send the instructions to make proteins so drugs bind to proteins and either turn them off ,COMMA etc .PERIOD it's as interesting a side effect as it could be one other thing you can do with such a thing is you can because it's a pattern matching exercise because there's unique fingerprint .PERIOD we can actually scan through the entire genome and find other proteins that show a similar fingerprint .PERIOD now they can come in ,COMMA and they can start to get clues about activity .PERIOD and then we find some outliers some things that lie beyond the cloud .PERIOD and those genes are interesting ,COMMA but they're very subtle .PERIOD these are things where genes are turned on in an individual cell type .PERIOD i think these resources are incredibly valuable .PERIOD and there is something else .PERIOD i believe in the back of your mind ,COMMA you also know .PERIOD and worst of all we will never know .PERIOD and the reason is that -- take africa .PERIOD for example ,COMMA africans have already got a lot of aid .PERIOD we don't know .PERIOD and a third question education .PERIOD and in this way ,COMMA you can take the guesswork out of policy-making by knowing what works what doesn't work and why it's going from intention to action .PERIOD we cannot keep giving lentils to people .PERIOD we can just run an experiment .PERIOD second thing is ,COMMA how about the use ?QUESTIONMARK well in business ?QUESTIONMARK that's certainly not the way we would go about it .PERIOD now ,COMMA i'm going to show you what we get with various education interventions .PERIOD so now i started from the big problem ,COMMA and i couldn't answer it in haiti about 200000 .PERIOD people died -- actually a bit more by the latest estimate .PERIOD so why is that with deworming ?QUESTIONMARK you can get an extra year of education for three dollars .PERIOD so this evidence is powerful .PERIOD it can prompt action these economics .PERIOD i'm proposing it's like 20th century medicine ,COMMA fantastic tales ,COMMA anecdotes from speakers and turnarounds are part and parcel of what i have focused on for most of my professional career .PERIOD and she said ,COMMA i want to write a case .PERIOD euvin -- a case on a public-sector leader that has lessons for the corporate world .PERIOD the first thing that i saw was north america at night -- glowing in all its glory ,COMMA a warm feeling ,COMMA light entrepreneurs dynamic people people with hope .PERIOD so let's start shedding light on this amazing eclectic continent that has so much to offer .PERIOD so i want to share with you some of these bellwether signals or signs ,COMMA and winds of change that are sweeping this continent .PERIOD and let's start at the high level on the macro-factors egypt from the 16 percent to about 84 percent .PERIOD but what were they there for to acquire assets ,COMMA guarantee trust bank ?QUESTIONMARK recently ,COMMA issued the first euro bond out of africa .PERIOD and this excludes south africa ,COMMA 22 to 24 million barrels of oil a day ,COMMA -- the same league as kuwait the same league as venezuela .PERIOD so let's unpack those very quickly .PERIOD and i'm going to move through these very ,COMMA very ,COMMA very fast ,COMMA because i can see that clock counting down what else is going on there ,COMMA egypt close to the mediterranean ,COMMA near alexandria ,COMMA -- textiles petrochemicals .PERIOD so what are the signs that things are fundamentally changing what's going on in some of the other countries ?QUESTIONMARK but in any investment decision ,COMMA the key question is ,COMMA what is my alternative investment ?QUESTIONMARK now ,COMMA when looking at africa vis-a-vis other things and countries in africa ,COMMA vis-a-vis other things ,COMMA comparisons become important in 1899 ,COMMA joseph conrad released the heart of darkness ,COMMA a tale of grim ,COMMA horror along the congo river brain magic to me indicates that area of magic dealing with psychological and mind-reading effects .PERIOD so now you can see how easy it is for me to manipulate the human mind .PERIOD once you know how no ,COMMA but you're ,COMMA ok ,COMMA yes ,COMMA that is weird .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD now ,COMMA i'm going to give you some demonstrations up here .PERIOD live right now .PERIOD and let's see down at the end here .PERIOD can you also come up real quick now .PERIOD it's very important for everybody here to realize i haven't set anything up with you guys .PERIOD you don't know what's about to happen is that agreed ?QUESTIONMARK ok ?QUESTIONMARK would you mind just standing over here for a moment ?QUESTIONMARK your name is ok .PERIOD a little bit closer come over -- .PERIOD they look really nervous up here voodoo besides ,COMMA who's next no ,COMMA ok .PERIOD i want you to be aware of the sensations ,COMMA but don't say anything until i ask you and don't open your eyes until i ask you ,COMMA yes ,COMMA or no .PERIOD did you feel anything ?QUESTIONMARK yeah .PERIOD i walk around nightclubs all night like this .PERIOD and can you take a seat right over here for me if you don't mind ,COMMA and i want you to hold it there just for a moment .PERIOD and i only want you to allow your hand to sink and drift and float back to the tabletop at the same rate and speed as you drift and float into this relaxed state of awareness and allow it to go all the way down to the tabletop .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK and only when you feel the pressure go back .PERIOD i want you to allow your hand to slowly drift back to the tabletop .PERIOD but only when you feel the pressure allow it to stick firmly to the tabletop .PERIOD keep your eyes closed .PERIOD can you stand up ?QUESTIONMARK imagine a connection between you and him point directly at his forehead .PERIOD now ,COMMA i want you to be aware that in a moment ,COMMA when i snap my fingers ,COMMA your eyes will open again .PERIOD it's nearly impossible to break a coke bottle .PERIOD you see ,COMMA psychokinesis is the paranormal ,COMMA influence of the mind on physical events and processes be careful because it is sharp just hold on to it for a moment .PERIOD and i want you to release that negative energy by shaking it from side to side .PERIOD there's five letters in the title .PERIOD there's a k in his name .PERIOD there is a k .PERIOD you knew no one in the audience and just to help you out .PERIOD i'll block them from view .PERIOD so nobody can see what you're doing ,COMMA but i don't want you to know either .PERIOD so swivel around on your chair ,COMMA your right hand is that -- ?QUESTIONMARK no ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK ok .PERIOD tell me when to stop .PERIOD yes .PERIOD there's one .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK do you think it's here .PERIOD yes or no ,COMMA neither oh ,COMMA ok ,COMMA we're the only creatures with fully developed moral sentiments .PERIOD after 10 years of experiments ,COMMA i found it .PERIOD it can't be that important turns out it wasn't so easy .PERIOD and when it's produced ,COMMA it has a three-minute half-life and degrades rapidly at room temperature .PERIOD then i had to measure morality .PERIOD so i started smaller .PERIOD so poor countries are by and large low trust countries .PERIOD so we recruit some people for an experiment .PERIOD we give them lots of instruction ,COMMA and we never ever deceive them .PERIOD so think about this experiment for minute ,COMMA but why two things ?QUESTIONMARK i didn't know for sure oxytocin caused trustworthiness .PERIOD i used everything short of a drill to get oxytocin into my own brain .PERIOD these include massage ,COMMA dancing and praying .PERIOD in this book smith argued that we are moral creatures ,COMMA not because of a top-down reason ,COMMA but for a bottom-up reason .PERIOD so if i do something that hurts ,COMMA you ,COMMA i feel that pain .PERIOD i'm working at a gas station on the outskirts of santa barbara ,COMMA california ,COMMA tell that guy to wait half an hour .PERIOD so this is a classic con called the pigeon drop .PERIOD and i was the pigeon .PERIOD they have many of the attributes of psychopaths .PERIOD one is through improper nurturing .PERIOD so we've studied sexually abused women and about half .PERIOD those don't release oxytocin on stimulus .PERIOD she had the biggest increase in oxytocin .PERIOD so i think it tells us that we've designed this ritual to connect us to this new couple ,COMMA connect us ,COMMA emotionally .PERIOD so my penchant for hugging other people has earned me .PERIOD the nickname dr love .PERIOD we have found that people who release more oxytocin are happier ,COMMA and they're happier because they have better relationships of all types .PERIOD i'll play at these rock shows be on stage standing completely still .PERIOD and they're like what's she doing ?QUESTIONMARK what's she doing ?QUESTIONMARK so ,COMMA basically ,COMMA with both of your hands ,COMMA you're controlling pitch and volume ,COMMA and kind of trying to create the illusion that you're doing separate notes when really it's continuously going .PERIOD maybe we'll go into the next tune because i totally lost where this is going .PERIOD it was invented around the 1920s and the inventor ,COMMA léon ,COMMA theremin -- .PERIOD he also was a musician ,COMMA besides an inventor -- .PERIOD he came up with the idea for making the theremin .PERIOD i think when he was working on some shortwave radios ,COMMA and then also you're trying to stay very ,COMMA very ,COMMA very still because little movements with other parts of your body will affect the pitch ,COMMA or sometimes ,COMMA if you're holding a low note ,COMMA -- -- and breathing will make it .PERIOD and it's meant to kind of reflect how we engage with histories or stories on the internet in a less linear form .PERIOD he was sent in 1907 to palestine ,COMMA by the zionist organization to look at areas for jewish settlement ,COMMA and acquire land for jewish settlement .PERIOD during the course of this trial ,COMMA all of the rabbits died except for a few which were euthanized .PERIOD so when you look at a detail of this work ,COMMA you can see the man on the upper-left is the father of the woman sitting next to him during the time i was in bosnia ,COMMA the mortal remains of zumra's .PERIOD eldest son were exhumed from a mass grave .PERIOD however ,COMMA the other individuals are represented by these blue slides ,COMMA which show tooth and bone samples that were matched to dna evidence ,COMMA collected from family members to prove they were the identities of those individuals .PERIOD there's also parents who participated ,COMMA who wouldn't let their children participate ,COMMA because they thought they were too young to decide for themselves .PERIOD it was released in poland to create friction between frank and hitler .PERIOD so that hitler would imagine frank was trying to usurp his power again ,COMMA talking about fate .PERIOD i was interested in the stories ,COMMA and fate of particular works of art .PERIOD chapter 12 ,COMMA highlights people being born into a battle that is not of their making ,COMMA but becomes their own .PERIOD i'm not quite sure ,COMMA whether i really want to see a snare drum at nine o'clock or so in the morning .PERIOD and it sounds quite simple .PERIOD but actually ,COMMA it's quite a big big job .PERIOD i will follow the instructions ,COMMA the tempo ,COMMA markings ,COMMA the dynamics .PERIOD but here ,COMMA i'm being told that the piece of music is very quick .PERIOD just the basic feeling .PERIOD we have to listen to ourselves first of all .PERIOD and i just feel at last one with the stick and one with the drum ,COMMA not just translate them ,COMMA but interpret them can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger there ,COMMA every single one of us ,COMMA depending on where we're sitting will experience .PERIOD this sound quite quite differently .PERIOD do you see what i mean ?QUESTIONMARK so ,COMMA because of this explosion in access to sound ,COMMA especially through the deaf community ,COMMA this has not only affected how music institutions ,COMMA how schools for the deaf ,COMMA treat sound -- ,COMMA and not just as a means of therapy -- ,COMMA although ,COMMA of course ,COMMA being a participator of music ,COMMA that definitely is the case as well may be great there ,COMMA but terrible up there .PERIOD we just -- .PERIOD we go like that .PERIOD and we imagine that that's what deafness is about .PERIOD in a year's time .PERIOD it could be two extra steps for me as a musician ,COMMA who deals with 99 percent of new music .PERIOD it's very easy for me to say ,COMMA oh yes ,COMMA i like that piece .PERIOD oh ,COMMA no ,COMMA i don't like that piece and so on .PERIOD and please try to create that through your clapping .PERIOD try just -- ,COMMA please ,COMMA try very good snow .PERIOD snow .PERIOD have you ever heard snow ?QUESTIONMARK evelyn glennie :COLON well ,COMMA then stop clapping .PERIOD try again .PERIOD see ,COMMA you're awake .PERIOD however ,COMMA not one of you got out of your seats to think right ?QUESTIONMARK how can i clap ?QUESTIONMARK ok ,COMMA maybe i may feel sorrowful or happy or exhilarated or angry .PERIOD when i play certain pieces of music ,COMMA but i'm not necessarily wanting you to feel exactly the same thing .PERIOD the performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound ,COMMA because they're hearing the contact of the stick on the drum ,COMMA or the mallet on the bit of wood ,COMMA or the bow on the string ,COMMA etc ,COMMA or the breath that's creating the sound from wind and brass .PERIOD it's a video game move from star fox .PERIOD and we've gone from one board to 48 boards ,COMMA what the site's known for ,COMMA because it has this environment is it's fostered the creation of a lot of internet phenomena ,COMMA viral videos and whatnot known as memes .PERIOD and so there are three that i want to show you specifically .PERIOD it is where a third of all .PERIOD the traffic is going .PERIOD they got it taken offline and managed to piss off part of the internet .PERIOD so we've got this activist group .PERIOD that's this grassroots group .PERIOD that's come out of the site .PERIOD dusty is the name that we've given to this cat .PERIOD we're sacrificing a lot of that ,COMMA and i think in doing so moving towards those things .PERIOD we're losing something valuable .PERIOD you're lucky that this is not being streamed to them live right now .PERIOD well ,COMMA you never know some of them -- .PERIOD we've got people in 75 countries out there watching don't tell and saying ,COMMA whatever you like ,COMMA i think ,COMMA is powerful .PERIOD and the thing is ,COMMA i didn't make it into that presentation ,COMMA because i can't read to you anything that they said more or less .PERIOD okay .PERIOD well ,COMMA you've got this surprising semi-underground influence ,COMMA but it's not making you a lot of money .PERIOD yet .PERIOD yeah ,COMMA they still didn't know what to think of that ,COMMA though ,COMMA within five 10 million years of the bolide impact ,COMMA we had a whole variety of animals going into the water .PERIOD why didn't they do that ?QUESTIONMARK you want to measure it by diversity .PERIOD this slide was shown before .PERIOD this is the famous jurassic bird archaeopteryx .PERIOD if we could roll that first video clip ,COMMA but one with an immense chalkboard in the middle ,COMMA with lots of little areas of dinosaur rock ,COMMA if you could survive an expedition and the kinds of teams they bring in .PERIOD so you are finding yourself also in an amazing cultural milieu .PERIOD you're really rubbing shoulders with the world's last great nomadic .PERIOD people .PERIOD here's the animal that was causing it trouble .PERIOD it is an incredible view of life .PERIOD and it really began when we began to understand the depth of time .PERIOD we prototyped by cat-scanning the brain out of this animal .PERIOD now ,COMMA this field is just -- .PERIOD and of course ,COMMA science in general -- is just -- adventure .PERIOD narrator :COLON if they can just land it ,COMMA this croc will provide useful data helping paul in his quest to understand sarcosuchus .PERIOD i've got it .PERIOD i've got the back legs .PERIOD paul sereno .PERIOD let's get this tape measure on him .PERIOD put it right there .PERIOD wow .PERIOD anyway ,COMMA you find other things too .PERIOD these are all landlubbing animals .PERIOD there's a couple of choices ,COMMA and you take those four instances ,COMMA and you realize you have a complex problem .PERIOD they did it within two or three degrees of the pole to maintain similarity between continents .PERIOD now ,COMMA we have divergence over time ,COMMA but we've created the third dimension of area .PERIOD i was a total failure in school ,COMMA not really headed to graduate high school .PERIOD what about all the kids like me that were in school -- kids ,COMMA like some of you out there -- that were in school and didn't get a chance ,COMMA and will never get a chance to participate in science and technology .PERIOD because when you go out there as a scholar ,COMMA and you try to find out longitudinal studies track records like that ,COMMA there essentially are very few if none .PERIOD thank you very much .PERIOD and as a little girl ,COMMA i loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us much more like a helpful .PERIOD trusted sidekick -- something that would delight us enrich our lives and help us save a galaxy or two .PERIOD i almost lost it this week ,COMMA leo .PERIOD this is cookie monster .PERIOD we looked at psychological involvement ,COMMA -- ,COMMA how much empathy did you feel for the other person ?QUESTIONMARK we looked at their desire to cooperate today .PERIOD we know that families are living further and further apart .PERIOD and that definitely takes a toll on family relationships and family bonds over distance .PERIOD and as grandma-bot ,COMMA she can now play really play with my sons with her grandsons in the real world ,COMMA with his real toys .PERIOD another was a computer that ran the same touch-screen interface ran exactly the same dialogues .PERIOD the quality of advice was identical .PERIOD we've invited a lot of kids into this space ,COMMA and they think it's pretty cool .PERIOD that's her competition ,COMMA paula radcliffe .PERIOD the one person who is sure to snatch the big paycheck out of derartu tulu's under-underdog hands .PERIOD suddenly grabs her leg and starts to fall back .PERIOD they're not doing 26 miles .PERIOD they're doing 100 150 miles at a time and apparently without injury ,COMMA without problems .PERIOD and if you know it ,COMMA then you are smarter than anybody else on planet earth .PERIOD australopithecus had a tiny little pea brain .PERIOD the only problem is the first edged weapons only appeared about 200000 years ago .PERIOD we're not fast her uterus would be torn .PERIOD then you go beyond 26 miles into the distance that medical science also told us would be fatal to humans .PERIOD -- remember pheidippides died when he ran 26 miles -- .PERIOD you get to 50 and 100 miles .PERIOD and suddenly it's a different game .PERIOD well ,COMMA emily baer -- ,COMMA 500 runners ,COMMA -- .PERIOD she finishes in eighth place in the top 10 ,COMMA even though she stopped at all the aid stations to breastfeed her baby during the race ,COMMA -- and yet ,COMMA beat 492 other people ,COMMA and you'll get slower and slower ,COMMA until eventually you're back to running the same speed .PERIOD you were at age 19 .PERIOD now ,COMMA i defy you to come up with any other physical activity -- .PERIOD and please don't say golf -- something that actually is hard -- where geriatrics are performing as well as they did as teenagers .PERIOD maybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal .PERIOD well ,COMMA if that's true a couple other things had to be true as well .PERIOD the key to being part of a hunting pack is the word pack .PERIOD you need to have those 27-year-old studs at the peak of their powers ,COMMA ready to drop the kill .PERIOD and you need to have those teenagers there who are learning the whole thing all involved .PERIOD you can't be hauling all your crap around trying to chase the antelope .PERIOD he pissed me off let him go chase his own antelope .PERIOD geronimo used to say that my only friends are my legs .PERIOD i only trust my legs that's because an apache triathlon used to be .PERIOD you'd run 50 miles across the desert ,COMMA engage in hand-to-hand ,COMMA combat steal ,COMMA a bunch of horses and slap leather for home .PERIOD i didn't do yoga .PERIOD i'm not ready .PERIOD so ,COMMA hopefully it's something .PERIOD we can all benefit from .PERIOD i show a number of photographs and films ,COMMA but i also make television programs books .PERIOD and some advertising all with the same concept .PERIOD i was fascinated by this phenomenon .PERIOD so i wondered could one erase the image of diana ,COMMA actually ,COMMA quite crudely and physically .PERIOD momentum was being built .PERIOD i then went on wondering whether i could actually replace her image .PERIOD so i got a look-alike of diana and posed her in the right positions and angles and created something that was in or existed in the public imagination .PERIOD so this is an image of diana looking at camilla kissing her husband .PERIOD and this was a sequence of images ,COMMA all this imagery was creating a lot of fuss .PERIOD and i was cited as a disgusting artist .PERIOD the press were writing about this ,COMMA giving full pages about how terrible this was .PERIOD but then this changed .PERIOD suddenly ,COMMA i was sitting next to someone at dinner the other day ,COMMA and they were saying ,COMMA there's this great image of the queen sitting outside william hill .PERIOD i explored with actually dressing up as the celebrities myself and me as the queen .PERIOD i then continued on to make a whole body of work about marilyn -- ,COMMA the biggest icon of all -- and trying to titillate by shooting through doorways and shutters and so on and so forth ,COMMA and only showing certain angles to create a reality that obviously is completely constructed .PERIOD i did an advertising campaign for schweppes ,COMMA which is coca-cola .PERIOD and so that was very interesting in terms of the legalities tony blair and cherie .PERIOD and again ,COMMA the legalities -- .PERIOD we had to be very careful ,COMMA and the press were interviewing .PERIOD and i was signing my book .PERIOD and in fact ,COMMA george bush and tony blair are having great fun during all of this .PERIOD so there was a lot of meaning in my life ,COMMA because i was performing this type of research during the day .PERIOD my left hemisphere -- .PERIOD our left hemisphere .PERIOD -- is a very different place .PERIOD our left hemisphere is all about the past .PERIOD and it's all about the future .PERIOD it's that ongoing brain chatter that connects me and my internal world to my external world .PERIOD i become a single solid individual separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you .PERIOD and i looked down at my body ,COMMA and i thought ,COMMA whoa ,COMMA i'm a weird-looking thing .PERIOD and it was as though my consciousness had shifted away from my normal perception of reality ,COMMA where i'm the person on the machine having the experience to some esoteric space ,COMMA where i'm witnessing myself having this experience .PERIOD i can't define where i begin ,COMMA and where i end because the atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall .PERIOD and then i would wait for what i call a wave of clarity .PERIOD and so i say to him -- clear in my mind ,COMMA i say to him .PERIOD this is jill .PERIOD i need help nirvana .PERIOD i found nirvana .PERIOD and i remember thinking ,COMMA there's no way i would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body ,COMMA two and a half weeks .PERIOD after the hemorrhage ,COMMA the surgeons went in ,COMMA and they removed a blood clot .PERIOD the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers .PERIOD i believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep

come at a price of about two dollars .PERIOD this is at the heart institute .PERIOD the doctors from anywhere can log in .PERIOD they'll give me that information ,COMMA and we'll make the care of the

everybody thought in pictures .PERIOD ok ,COMMA there is my childhood church that's specific .PERIOD there's some more fort collins .PERIOD but one of the things that really worries me is where's the younger version of those kids going today ?QUESTIONMARK and then there's a verbal mind .PERIOD they know ,COMMA every fact about everything .PERIOD and i came in half an hour beforehand .PERIOD so i could have it put on and kind of get used to it ,COMMA and they got it bent .PERIOD so it's not hitting my chin ,COMMA because think about it .PERIOD an animal is a sensory-based thinker .PERIOD not

system in real time ,COMMA being formed on a smaller scale .PERIOD so it's like a test bed for it .PERIOD now you think that those rings are very large objects that was [unclear] also -- .PERIOD you know ,COMMA because we were worried about the risk of it ,COMMA but it worked pretty well .PERIOD so people believe now that titan is most likely what we call a pre-biotic planet ,COMMA because it's so cold ,COMMA organic material did not get to the stage of becoming biological material ,COMMA and therefore life could have evolved on it .PERIOD so here we have a cycle of a planet ,COMMA which is like our earth ,COMMA but is all made of ethane and methane and organic material and being the current day .PERIOD of course ,COMMA we started our own facebook group .PERIOD now ,COMMA why am i telling you this story ?QUESTIONMARK and what does this have to do with the future of health ?QUESTIONMARK what i'd like to talk about today is understanding these exponential technologies and coming

had their teacher taught them .PERIOD the truth is that we know that the images themselves don't change the world .PERIOD but we're also aware that since the beginning of photography ,COMMA images have provoked reactions in people .PERIOD and those reactions have caused change to happen .PERIOD it changed our view of the physical world .PERIOD some would argue that it is those images that did more to fuel the insurgency in iraq than virtually any other single act .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA these images became the voices of protest themselves .PERIOD i was the only human being in an area

performance that was actually performing terribly .PERIOD and he pulled the whole mean down destroying my statistical significance of the test .PERIOD so i looked carefully at this guy ,COMMA and i'm sure that it's something that we all recognize .PERIOD and we see that it happens .PERIOD and that's a much much more difficult lesson to take into account in my mind .PERIOD i was actually a knight trying to help science move along .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA this is all very depressing ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK -- people have conflicts of interest .PERIOD we don't see it .PERIOD and so on .PERIOD this is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist who's been in field of hiv for 15 years ,COMMA worked on four continents ,COMMA and you're looking at her .PERIOD and so everyone lined up all the smackheads in a row .PERIOD and the guy whose birthday it was filled up the fit .PERIOD and he went down and started injecting people .PERIOD so his choice was either to accept that dirty needle or not to get high .PERIOD so what's that about is it like you get a better high if you share or something ?QUESTIONMARK so she was making a politically rational decision .PERIOD i've always been a bit curious about that ,COMMA because i think stigma is a bad thing .PERIOD whereas lots of sex is quite a good thing ,COMMA but we'll leave that be .PERIOD of course ,COMMA you can't get hiv just by having unprotected sex .PERIOD and again ,COMMA it's because of an alignment of the incentives ,COMMA and actually clients don't want to go home with a drip either .PERIOD he's from haiti ,COMMA and he has aids .PERIOD and the other thing is that people are simply not as scared of hiv as they were of aids and rightly so ,COMMA we've got the tools ,COMMA the knowledge and the cash and commitment

,COMMA exactly i was in afghanistan .PERIOD would you like to see civil war sectarian killing ?QUESTIONMARK they found something called facebook .PERIOD this is what they were telling .PERIOD this is

civilization .PERIOD they have been detached from their people from the masses .PERIOD and now we are seeing them collapsing one after the other ,COMMA i felt the responsibility to phone our

especially in the west -- from thinking ,COMMA about that part of the world ,COMMA based on oil interest ,COMMA or based on interests of the illusion of stability and security ,COMMA is this a

,COMMA even opposition leaders ,COMMA including political parties .PERIOD thank you so much .PERIOD and i'm going to have michael manring ,COMMA play bass with me .PERIOD she got mad .PERIOD i took a

,COMMA my mother hoped that we learned from that the value of hard work .PERIOD no ,COMMA we learned something else .PERIOD the first thing i learned that day was that i never ever wanted to work that hard again ,COMMA but that day in the cotton field out there picking ,COMMA when those people started singing ,COMMA i realized i was in the very heart of real music .PERIOD and that's where i've wanted to be ever since good news chariot's coming .PERIOD it was a few years ago ,COMMA but i sort of remembered this story ,COMMA and i told it at a concert ,COMMA my mom was in the audience .PERIOD i just wanted you boys to learn the value of hard work .PERIOD and i don't want it to leave me behind .PERIOD i just break off another bottleneck and play .PERIOD these steel guitar blues .PERIOD they were about my age .PERIOD it had three chemicals .PERIOD we were really surprised to see sulfur potassium nitrate and charcoal .PERIOD we tore everything down and buried it in his backyard .PERIOD we have about 120 million dollars ,COMMA and we want to do it .PERIOD well ,COMMA the first thing that anybody who knows science and has been around science is that the stuff you learn in school as a scientific method is wrong .PERIOD there is no method i’m ,COMMA not going to read them all to you because i’m ,COMMA not in teacher mode .PERIOD and i want to talk about three stages in that evolution .PERIOD in that year ,COMMA we are not available for any of our clients .PERIOD we are totally closed .PERIOD quite the similar idea .PERIOD then a perfume packaged in a book in a die .PERIOD cut ,COMMA i likely already look forward to the weekend on thursdays europe .PERIOD and the us didn't really feel enticing because i knew them too well ,COMMA so asia it was .PERIOD so i looked for furniture .PERIOD so one of the things that we pursued in bali was pieces of furniture .PERIOD and i think ,COMMA by the time this lamp came about .PERIOD i had finally made peace with those dogs .PERIOD i also started meditating for the first time in my life in bali .PERIOD his latest numbers are fairly impressive .PERIOD so i became my own intern .PERIOD i had fun financially seen over the long term .PERIOD it was actually successful .PERIOD we were asked to design an identity for casa da musica the rem koolhaas-built music center in porto in portugal .PERIOD it has a more transparent identity ,COMMA some of you might have seen it .PERIOD so ,COMMA after eight hours ,COMMA that's pretty much all that was left of the whole thing .PERIOD so i'll just give you my message up .PERIOD front .PERIOD try not to go extinct .PERIOD people ask me a lot -- .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA one of the most asked questions i get is why do children like dinosaurs so much every museum wanted a little bigger or better one than anybody else had .PERIOD so everyone was out looking for all these bigger and better dinosaurs ,COMMA and they thought about it .PERIOD and they even wrote papers about it ,COMMA where are the little dinosaurs ?QUESTIONMARK first off scientists have egos and scientists like to name dinosaurs .PERIOD so this is where people went astray again ,COMMA but i have a museum ,COMMA and i collect dinosaurs ,COMMA and i can saw mine open .PERIOD and if you cut into an older dinosaur ,COMMA it's very massive .PERIOD so here's a dinosaur that has spikes sticking out of its head ,COMMA no dome and gnarly stuff on its nose .PERIOD nobody noticed the gnarly stuff sort of looked alike .PERIOD dracorex is the littlest .PERIOD one stygimoloch is the middle size .PERIOD one .PERIOD pachycephalosaurus is the largest one ,COMMA but it didn't give them a clue .PERIOD so we have a whole bunch of them at our museum .PERIOD and then as they grow older ,COMMA the horns grow forward .PERIOD if you look along the edge of the frill ,COMMA they have these little triangular bones that actually grow big as triangles .PERIOD and then they flatten against the frill pretty much like the spikes do on the pachycephalosaurs ,COMMA and we get rid of anatotitan .PERIOD so again ,COMMA real easy to say that tyrannosaurus ontogeny included nanotyrannus .PERIOD and therefore we can take out another dinosaur now as you can imagine ,COMMA this is not very popular with fourth-graders .PERIOD this is soft sell for 42nd street .PERIOD they weren't doing their primary work ,COMMA which was for the government while they were helping us with this .PERIOD and many musicians choose to use the theater glass walls totally open chamber .PERIOD and the notion of chamber has to do with salons and small-scale performances .PERIOD they asked us to bring an intimacy .PERIOD and this is a mockup that is in salt lake city .PERIOD that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full-scale .PERIOD chris has been so nice .PERIOD so nice all week .PERIOD he's the kind of man you could say to chris .PERIOD i'm really sorry .PERIOD i've crashed your car ,COMMA and you know that chris would say ,COMMA thank you ,COMMA emmanuel absolutely .PERIOD so ,COMMA that's going to look pretty shabby now .PERIOD so what i thought i'd do is -- in honor of emmanuel -- is what i can do is to launch today .PERIOD the first ted global auction ,COMMA and he'll say ,COMMA you're offering me things that are infinitely variable .PERIOD and she's desperate to find more evidence for the link .PERIOD this man has swum around the north pole .PERIOD what more evidence do you want ?QUESTIONMARK no ?QUESTIONMARK alright ?QUESTIONMARK it was never exactly 'brokeback mountain' .PERIOD you know ,COMMA i wrote to him just before i left office .PERIOD i said ,COMMA 'can ,COMMA i rely on your support for the next month' .PERIOD and he wrote back ,COMMA he said ,COMMA 'no ,COMMA you can't' ,COMMA which kind of surprised me because i'd never seen 'can't' spelled that way before when you think what's happened to financial services .PERIOD and you see what's happened to the economy .PERIOD you think ,COMMA well ,COMMA there is a man who delivers on his promises ,COMMA and you know ,COMMA iceland .PERIOD it was never going to cut it .PERIOD luckily ,COMMA somebody like george bush was really helpful .PERIOD he summed it up really at a dinner .PERIOD and then you're now .PERIOD well ,COMMA actually ,COMMA that's what this is about .PERIOD well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i'm sorry about that .PERIOD and you want a leader who inspires and challenges and makes you want to be a better citizen ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK so he comes over to this country ,COMMA and he says ,COMMA we need a big fiscal stimulus .PERIOD he goes to prague .PERIOD he says ,COMMA we believe in a nuclear-free world .PERIOD do you remember that george bush ,COMMA a nu-ca-ler ,COMMA who said reach out and touch ?QUESTIONMARK so nelson ,COMMA how would you like a nice water feature ?QUESTIONMARK and we need six to eight waist-high plants per person .PERIOD and it has close to 1200 such plants for 300 occupants .PERIOD our studies have found that there is a 42 percent probability of one's blood oxygen going up by one percent .PERIOD if one stays indoors in this building for 10 hours .PERIOD and the study showed that compared to other buildings ,COMMA there is a reduced incidence of eye ,COMMA irritation by 52 percent respiratory systems ,COMMA by 34 percent headaches ,COMMA by 24 percent lung impairment by 12 percent and asthma by nine percent .PERIOD why is this important ?QUESTIONMARK so how do you feel about that -- the whole -- ?QUESTIONMARK ma ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA it's pretty irritating ,COMMA actually ,COMMA because nobody ever describes what a man is wearing .PERIOD and no guy ever gets criticized ,COMMA but that's the least of it .PERIOD how did you handle that balance between being the tough ,COMMA diplomatic and strong voice of this country to the rest of the world ,COMMA and also how you felt about yourself as a mother ,COMMA a grandmother ,COMMA nurturing .PERIOD and so how did you handle that ?QUESTIONMARK because in her lifetime -- ,COMMA ma ,COMMA that would be so thank you for joining us .PERIOD today ,COMMA my little group of molecular programmers are trying to refashion all of these parts from dna .PERIOD and if you buy all of this ,COMMA and you think life is about computation as i do .PERIOD then you look at big questions through the eyes of a computer scientist .PERIOD this is exactly analogous to the question .PERIOD what's the smallest program ?QUESTIONMARK i can write that will act exactly like microsoft word ,COMMA and just as he's writing ,COMMA you know ,COMMA bacteria that will be smaller .PERIOD he's writing genomes that will work .PERIOD we could write smaller programs that would do what microsoft word does .PERIOD now ,COMMA these are big questions in computer science that holds the long strand like this .PERIOD i wanted to fold dna into something that goes up over the eye down the nose up the nose around the forehead back down and end in a little loop like this .PERIOD it's got a needle like a record needle that goes back and forth over the surface bumps up and down and feels the height of the first surface .PERIOD she wrote all her own software to design and built this dna origami ,COMMA a beautiful rendition of china ,COMMA which even has taiwan .PERIOD and you can see ,COMMA it's sort of on the world's shortest leash right now .PERIOD this is just a single switch ,COMMA and you need half a billion for a computer .PERIOD so we have a long way to go the dna .PERIOD origami is a proof that that compiler actually works .PERIOD the fact is that it does not scale .PERIOD so now we can use this counting to try and get at much bigger things than dna origami could otherwise ,COMMA you can just change a couple of the dna strands in this binary representation ,COMMA and you'll get 96 rather than 32 .PERIOD here is a dna origami rectangle .PERIOD and here are some tiles growing from it .PERIOD so it turns out we actually had this idea nine years ago ,COMMA and that's about the time constant for how long it takes to do these kinds of things .PERIOD so i think we made a lot of progress .PERIOD we've got ideas about how to fix these errors .PERIOD what it's really about is taking computer science ,COMMA and looking at big questions in a new light ,COMMA asking new versions of those big questions and trying to understand how biology can make such amazing things .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD therefore ,COMMA it would be too risky to release these animals both for the released and for the natural populations .PERIOD so this is not new .PERIOD people have been doing this around the world .PERIOD so these genes are indeed going back to the populations .PERIOD so i say ,COMMA let's study more .PERIOD let's shed light on this issue .PERIOD let's do whatever we can this song kind of came out of all of that .PERIOD we ended up being the first medical response team in every incident location and transported 125 victims ,COMMA saving life .PERIOD and the other is moksha-yug access ,COMMA which is integrating rural supply chain on the foundations of self-help group-based microfinance .PERIOD now i come back to the idea of the new social enterprise that i'm exploring often .PERIOD it is the constraining or the back-to-the-wall situation that the hapless common man finds himself or herself in that leads him to pay a bribe .PERIOD now let me ask you another question ,COMMA but you also don't have the time resources expertise or wherewithal to fight this like a bribe buster service or 1-800-fight-bribes ,COMMA or wwwstopbribesorg or wwwpreventcorruptionorg .PERIOD i don't want to be haunted by such images ,COMMA any more a set of people actually say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA let me just grant it to them and run away from it .PERIOD but the one thing i want you to notice about them is this ,COMMA even though this is a very long list .PERIOD there isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings .PERIOD and yet ,COMMA when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like ,COMMA they encountered mike who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor because mr jones was out of his bed ,COMMA getting a little exercise ,COMMA trying to build up his strength ,COMMA walking slowly up and down the hall .PERIOD and then there was luke who washed the floor in a comatose young man's room twice ,COMMA because the man's father who had been keeping a vigil for six months .PERIOD didn't see luke do it the first time ,COMMA and his father was angry ,COMMA a wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule as the janitors knew ,COMMA when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives ,COMMA a wise person is like a jazz musician ,COMMA -- using the notes on the page ,COMMA but dancing around them ,COMMA inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation .PERIOD and the people at hand ,COMMA a wise person knows how to use these moral skills in the service of the right aims .PERIOD dad :COLON being an academic had no idea that mike's hard lemonade contained alcohol ,COMMA and they were ready to let the kid go when things go wrong .PERIOD as of course ,COMMA they do .PERIOD we reach for two tools to try to fix them ,COMMA say ,COMMA 75 items in this script to teach a 25-page picture book scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster .PERIOD jazz musicians need some notes -- ,COMMA most of them need some notes on the page .PERIOD we need more rules for the bankers .PERIOD god knows some psychologists went around and polled citizens ,COMMA who were very well informed .PERIOD they said ,COMMA if we paid you six weeks' salary ,COMMA every year ,COMMA would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community ?QUESTIONMARK we see this in medicine .PERIOD i don't know how many of you remember this another moral hero 15 years ago ,COMMA aaron feuerstein ,COMMA who was the head of malden mills in massachusetts ,COMMA -- .PERIOD they made polartec -- .PERIOD the factory burned down .PERIOD and a bonus he's discovering is he's actually going to make even more money in many ways .PERIOD this is the perfect example .PERIOD so there's a lot here at ted and at other places to celebrate .PERIOD there are ordinary heroes ,COMMA even the wisest .PERIOD and most well-meaning people will give up if they have to swim against the current in the organizations in which they work .PERIOD and any moral work depends upon practical wisdom .PERIOD i think there is reason for hope .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD a few years ago ,COMMA i was visited by the guy that runs darpa .PERIOD the people that fund all the advanced technologies that businesses and universities probably wouldn't take the risk of doing .PERIOD now .PERIOD we've got f18s and f22s ,COMMA and if somebody loses an arm ,COMMA we give them a plastic stick with a hook on it .PERIOD if it's the raisin ,COMMA they won't drop it .PERIOD i told them they're nuts .PERIOD it will take the other nine to make it functional and useful .PERIOD i went back ,COMMA and i started putting a team together .PERIOD the best guys i could find with a passion to do this .PERIOD we walked into walter reed ,COMMA and i could not have been more wrong .PERIOD i can give you fast control with low reduction ratios in these gears ,COMMA or i can give you power .PERIOD i can't give you both .PERIOD i lost my right arm ,COMMA but i'm a lefty .PERIOD so we went back .PERIOD so we went back ,COMMA and we've been working harder yet ,COMMA and he was there ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA we needed to come .PERIOD he's got no arms ,COMMA who is going to pay for it .PERIOD those are tough questions .PERIOD i don't know the answers .PERIOD what do we need to do ?QUESTIONMARK there's very polarized answers to that question too .PERIOD and i don't have any answers to that .PERIOD i think ,COMMA eventually we'll make these things extraordinary and whining and complaining about what our foreign policy ought to be .PERIOD and we ought to give it to them that one was way more difficult than i had expected .PERIOD when the rescue workers came ,COMMA they resuscitated him ,COMMA and there was no brain damage .PERIOD so i took that as a challenge basically ,COMMA and i stayed inside of that water tank ,COMMA hoping my core temperature would start to drop .PERIOD so i realized that was completely not going to work .PERIOD so i went to talk to a doctor friend ,COMMA and i asked him ,COMMA how could i do that ?QUESTIONMARK then i actually started thinking about liquid breathing ,COMMA you blow in and out ,COMMA and you're really ridding your body of co2 .PERIOD and his total lung capacity is twice the size of an average person .PERIOD i had to drop 50 pounds in three months ,COMMA every bit of food was exactly what it was for its nutritional value .PERIOD and i started to really adapt my body .PERIOD i assumed that i could put a water tank at lincoln center .PERIOD and if i stayed there a week ,COMMA not eating ,COMMA i would get comfortable in that situation .PERIOD and i would slow my metabolism ,COMMA which i was sure would help me hold my breath longer than i had been able to do it .PERIOD and i thought everything seemed to be on track .PERIOD and by seven minutes ,COMMA i had gone into these awful convulsions .PERIOD this was a different record .PERIOD this was a pure o2 .PERIOD static apnea record that guinness had set the world record at 13 minutes ,COMMA a hypoxic tent is a tent that simulates altitude at 15000 feet ,COMMA but for tv .PERIOD they wanted me to be upright ,COMMA so they could see my face .PERIOD basically that made me extremely nervous raising the heart rate .PERIOD and there is no way to slow my heart rate down .PERIOD and i started having ischemia to the heart .PERIOD my heartbeat would go from 120 to 50 to 150 to 40 to 20 to 150 again .PERIOD so i let my feet out .PERIOD and i started floating to the top .PERIOD they had doctors with the pst ,COMMA you know .PERIOD so sitting there waiting as a magician ,COMMA i try to show things to people that seem impossible .PERIOD and then he stopped walking in front of him was her sure she had aged a little gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically while she filmed him ,COMMA because she was a keen amateur pornographer .PERIOD and that provides the ground for a type of action .PERIOD because consensus

line in it about human evolution .PERIOD if only darwin had nasa ,COMMA this has tremendous implications for our understanding of the evolution of human skin pigmentation ,COMMA and that skin pigmentation itself was a product of evolution .PERIOD so living at the equator .PERIOD we got lots and lots of ultraviolet radiation and the melanin -- .PERIOD this wonderful complex ,COMMA ancient

appreciated this ,COMMA even though he eschewed the importance of climate on the evolution of pigmentation during his own life .PERIOD well ,COMMA the topic i'm going to discuss is one ,COMMA which is

of course ,COMMA it's very easy to weigh it .PERIOD and when you eat it ,COMMA the weight matters -- .PERIOD but suppose you try to measure its surface ,COMMA if you cut with a sharp knife ,COMMA one

actually a surplus of food in the fertile regions of the south parts of the country -- .PERIOD but because in the north people could not access or entitle themselves to that food .PERIOD most africans today by far are farmers ,COMMA it also has very high cost implications speaking of risk .PERIOD we have seen that price volatility of food crops in africa is the highest in the world in the american midwest farmers used to load grain onto barges and send it upriver to the chicago market .PERIOD what's really important is that the ecx will operate a market information system to disseminate prices

go around and travel ,COMMA and look at some of the most beautiful places on the planet .PERIOD we know that hurricanes have always happened in the past .PERIOD we hear a lot about the collapse of cod

chris anderson :COLON while they're taking the podium away .PERIOD just a quick question .PERIOD you're making news out of the things that tell you that we're flourishing ,COMMA but it has to have political leadership .PERIOD the napalm is burning there .PERIOD quite nicely .PERIOD oil doesn't sink .PERIOD it floats .PERIOD and the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water ?QUESTIONMARK it triples ,COMMA the amount of oily messy goo that you have in the water .PERIOD and it makes it very hard to handle when the chemistry of the oil and water also hits our politics .PERIOD it's absolutely explosive .PERIOD they have a eureka moment when we suddenly understand oil in a different context .PERIOD you might notice that many gas pumps ,COMMA including this .PERIOD one are designed to look like .PERIOD atms early journalists ,COMMA looked at these spills .PERIOD and they said ,COMMA this is a filthy industry .PERIOD and the thing about john d is that he went into this chaotic wild-east of oil industry ,COMMA and he rationalized it into a vertically ,COMMA integrated company ,COMMA a multinational .PERIOD and then there's this guy .PERIOD okay .PERIOD so the thing about water oil spills is that they are very politically galvanizing .PERIOD they really influence people everything that we are really stemmed from this period .PERIOD one of the things that happened with the two previous oil spills was that we really worked on some of the symptoms .PERIOD and these guys ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA if they were in the us ,COMMA they might be actually here in this room .PERIOD and then the guy in the exxon uniform stepped out ,COMMA and we realized it was okay .PERIOD so what i'm going to talk to you about now is ,COMMA what do we have to do this time ?QUESTIONMARK we need to kind of get down and do the gritty work of reducing our dependence upon this fuel .PERIOD and these molecules ,COMMA cynthia schneider ,COMMA these programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society .PERIOD people become so engaged that they have volunteers just like political volunteers ,COMMA anyway ,COMMA who fan out over the countryside campaigning for their candidate one of them .PERIOD lima sahar is a pashtun from kandahar ,COMMA a very conservative part of the country .PERIOD it turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value .PERIOD and then a thought came across my mind .PERIOD if things go pear-shaped on this swim ,COMMA how long will it take for my frozen body to sink ,COMMA the four and a half kilometers to the bottom of the ocean ,COMMA nearly two billion people -- .PERIOD so one in three people on this earth -- rely on the water from the himalayas ,COMMA i carried on for another five or six strokes .PERIOD and then i had nothing in my body .PERIOD and i went down to the bottom of the lake .PERIOD it is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have .PERIOD and there we sat down ,COMMA and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong there on mt .PERIOD everest take some time to rest and think about things .PERIOD i say ,COMMA i do hardware because it sort of conveniently encompasses everything i do .PERIOD so this talk is going to be about .PERIOD how do we make things ?QUESTIONMARK and what are the new ways that we're going to make things in the future ?QUESTIONMARK and i was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues .PERIOD i have and said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA well ,COMMA if i have to talk about the future ,COMMA what is it literally think of proteins as subroutines that you can string together to execute a program ?QUESTIONMARK and this is being built by a group of students at zurich for a design competition in biology ,COMMA took me six years at mit ,COMMA and about that many pages to describe what i was doing .PERIOD and it took him one page .PERIOD and so this is our muse tucker and the ribosome here is another little computer that helps in the translation of the proteins .PERIOD these are little mechanical computers .PERIOD these are five-state state machines in a neutral state .PERIOD they won't bind at all .PERIOD so now i'm going to show you the hands-free autonomous self-replication .PERIOD so neil gershenfeld showed you this video on wednesday ,COMMA i believe ,COMMA but i'll show you again .PERIOD and how do we think about materials and structure sort of as an information and computation problem ?QUESTIONMARK this is a machine where you literally define a boundary condition .PERIOD we will be an overwhelmingly urban species .PERIOD and the correlation ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is that denser places tend to have lower emissions -- ,COMMA which isn't really all that difficult to figure out if you think about it .PERIOD and we're basically using mobility to get the access we need .PERIOD and it is possible ,COMMA of course ,COMMA to increase the density of the communities around us .PERIOD do they even take the very waste matter that we have from food and fiber and so forth and turn it back into soil and sequester carbon -- ,COMMA take carbon out of the air in the process of using our cities ?QUESTIONMARK because right now ,COMMA our economy by and large operates as paul hawken said ,COMMA by stealing ,COMMA the future selling it in the present and calling it gdp .PERIOD president clinton :COLON if you're here ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD well ,COMMA why has violence declined ?QUESTIONMARK no ,COMMA one really knows ,COMMA but i have read four explanations ,COMMA all of which i think have some grain of plausibility .PERIOD the first is ,COMMA maybe thomas hobbes ,COMMA got it right ?QUESTIONMARK he was the one who said that life in a state of nature was solitary ,COMMA poor nasty ,COMMA brutish and short ,COMMA not because he argued humans have some primordial thirst for blood or aggressive instinct ,COMMA or territorial imperative ,COMMA but because of the logic of anarchy in a state of anarchy ,COMMA there's a constant temptation to invade your neighbors preemptively before they invade .PERIOD you more recently ,COMMA thomas schelling gives the analogy of a homeowner who hears a rustling in the basement being a good american .PERIOD he has a pistol in the nightstand ,COMMA pulls out his gun and walks down the stairs .PERIOD it removes the need for a hair trigger for retaliation to make your deterrent threat credible .PERIOD and therefore it would lead to a state of peace .PERIOD eisner -- ,COMMA the man who plotted the homicide rates that you failed to see in the earlier slide ,COMMA -- argued that the timing of the decline of homicide in europe ,COMMA coincided with the rise of centralized states .PERIOD this was an argument from the political scientist ,COMMA james payne ,COMMA because we have been doing something right .PERIOD and it sure would be good to find out what it is .PERIOD we learned it in college .PERIOD we have liberia .PERIOD we have congo income per person .PERIOD i can put that here .PERIOD that's why we are so scared about flu .PERIOD isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK and especially it's interesting to see china and the united states during 200 years ,COMMA because i have my oldest son now ,COMMA working for google after google acquired this software ,COMMA mao tse-tung eventually brought health to china .PERIOD and then he died .PERIOD and then deng xiaoping started this amazing move forward .PERIOD and i come now into projections ,COMMA but i have to stop at the door of lehman brothers there ,COMMA you know ,COMMA because -- ,COMMA that's where the projections are not valid any longer east ,COMMA europe ,COMMA latin america and oecd countries .PERIOD it's lincoln here ,COMMA advancing them .PERIOD and we have countries all this way .PERIOD and what has happened in the world .PERIOD we used to boast about fast social progress .PERIOD that's where we were 1900 .PERIOD and you can see ,COMMA it's not that easy that it is war ,COMMA which caused this .PERIOD and here in zambia ,COMMA there is peace .PERIOD if i split tanzania in its income ,COMMA the richer 20 percent in tanzania ,COMMA has more hiv than the poorest one .PERIOD and it's really different within each country .PERIOD it's similar to the pellagra epidemic in mississippi in the '30s .PERIOD we have seen it here in mozambique that used to be the illegal diamond trade from the unita-dominated area .PERIOD in angola ,COMMA don't get confused of the progress of the emerging economies ,COMMA and the great capacity of people in the middle income countries ,COMMA and in peaceful ,COMMA low income countries ,COMMA i am a reformed marketer .PERIOD and i now work in international development .PERIOD he said ,COMMA there's just not in demand .PERIOD and as a marketer ,COMMA i found that curious .PERIOD and it turns out that there are three main messages used by the donor agencies for these condoms ,COMMA fear financing and fidelity .PERIOD they package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of hiv ,COMMA put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them show pictures of your wife or husband ,COMMA and tell you to protect them or to act prudently .PERIOD and so the lesson is this .PERIOD it doesn't really matter what you're selling .PERIOD you just have to think about who is your customer ,COMMA and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior ?QUESTIONMARK it was before the avian flu had reached europe .PERIOD i'll see what i can do .PERIOD ok ,COMMA generations go by somebody says ,COMMA hey ,COMMA why don't we put it on a stick just absolutely delights ?QUESTIONMARK the little ones point is ,COMMA there's obviously collaboration and organization going on beyond national bounds .PERIOD a lot of forms of non-zero-sum behavior in the realm of economics .PERIOD and so on in everyday life often leads to cooperation .PERIOD now ,COMMA this sounds like an intrinsically upbeat worldview in a way ,COMMA because when you think of non-zero ,COMMA you think win-win ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that's good .PERIOD well ,COMMA there are a few reasons that actually it's not intrinsically upbeat .PERIOD i have a whole global governance sermon that i will spare you right now ,COMMA because i don't think that's going to be enough anyway ,COMMA although it's essential that is to say ,COMMA -- -- .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD that is to say ,COMMA remember ,COMMA my whole view of morality is that it boils down to self-interest doing the best .PERIOD i can ,COMMA ok ,COMMA it was kind of along these lines .PERIOD and the allegation was that i have quote affection for terrorists ,COMMA and a kind of saving higher moral level ,COMMA something that kind of literally saves the world .PERIOD yahweh is our savior means .PERIOD he has saved the nation of israel ,COMMA which at the time was a pretty high-level social organization .PERIOD i am very ,COMMA very happy to be amidst .PERIOD some of the most -- .PERIOD the lights are really disturbing my eyes ,COMMA and they're reflecting on my glasses because despair civil war hunger and famine ,COMMA although they're part and parcel of our african reality .PERIOD they are not the only reality ,COMMA but they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship support private investment in africa ,COMMA both domestic and foreign ,COMMA which country is that the productive margin in our governments' search for revenue does not lie in the domestic economy .PERIOD it lies with international donors ,COMMA the imf ,COMMA the world bank and the cartel of good intentions in the world has taken over our rights as citizens .PERIOD and therefore what our governments are doing ,COMMA because they depend on aid is to listen to international creditors ,COMMA rather than their own citizens .PERIOD they talk to international donors ,COMMA where has all the aid gone uganda's ,COMMA recurrent expenditure -- by recurrent .PERIOD what do i mean ,COMMA the editor of discover told us 10 of them ?QUESTIONMARK i'm going to give you the eleventh .PERIOD so they came to me ,COMMA -- ,COMMA cnn -- .PERIOD and they said ,COMMA professor seligman ,COMMA would you tell us about the state of psychology today ?QUESTIONMARK look doctor seligman .PERIOD we can see you're really not comfortable in this medium ,COMMA not good enough .PERIOD and that's what i'm going to be talking about .PERIOD it should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage .PERIOD and starting about six years ago ,COMMA we asked about extremely happy people .PERIOD that's what aristotle was talking about .PERIOD the first life is the pleasant life ,COMMA and it's simply as best we can find it .PERIOD it's having as many of the pleasures ,COMMA as you can as much positive emotion ,COMMA as you can and learning the skills ,COMMA -- savoring ,COMMA mindfulness -- ,COMMA that amplify them that stretch them over time and space in two of the three great arenas of life .PERIOD by the time len was 30 .PERIOD len was enormously successful .PERIOD the first arena was work .PERIOD it turned out that -- len grew up in long island ,COMMA and he played football and watched football and played bridge .PERIOD -- len is in the bottom .PERIOD five percent of what we call positive affectivities when he walks onto the floor of the american exchange at 930 in the morning time ,COMMA stops for him .PERIOD and it stops till the closing bell .PERIOD and we think there's a recipe for it ,COMMA and it's knowing what your highest strengths are .PERIOD just one example .PERIOD one person i worked with was a bagger at genuardi's .PERIOD her highest strength was social intelligence .PERIOD so she re-crafted bagging to make the encounter with her the social highlight of every customer's day .PERIOD now ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA she failed .PERIOD what you get out of that is not smiley-ness .PERIOD i'd like you to remember someone who did something enormously important that changed your life in a good direction ,COMMA and who you never properly thanked .PERIOD i hope all of you have such a person ,COMMA but they were empty .PERIOD and so the parallel thing holds with technology ,COMMA entertainment and design .PERIOD i believe so in conclusion ,COMMA the eleventh reason for optimism .PERIOD in addition to the space elevator is that i think with technology ,COMMA entertainment and design .PERIOD we can actually increase the amount of tonnage of human happiness on the planet .PERIOD and if technology can in the next decade ,COMMA or two increase the pleasant life ,COMMA the good life and the meaningful life ,COMMA it will be good enough .PERIOD here's an example .PERIOD four years ago ,COMMA i was at the beach with my son ,COMMA and he was learning how to swim in this relatively soft surf of the delaware beaches .PERIOD so this represents -- .PERIOD this is a cross-sample of some remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photojournalists working at the very top of their craft -- ,COMMA except one ,COMMA but to be a great photojournalist ,COMMA you have to have more than just one or two great photographs in you .PERIOD but the centerpiece species of zakouma are the elephants .PERIOD and instead created a story that touched our audiences deeply .PERIOD instead of just knowledge of this park ,COMMA he created an understanding and an empathy for the elephants ,COMMA the rangers and the many issues surrounding human-wildlife conflicts .PERIOD he saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part of how the entire urban area functioned .PERIOD we also want to look for solutions .PERIOD jim took what could have been a straight-up medical science story and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply .PERIOD but there are also times when photographers simply encounter things that are when it comes down to it just plain fun .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD and my father was a soldier ,COMMA and my uncle was a fisherman ,COMMA and also a poacher for three times .PERIOD i applied to biomedical science to be a doctor .PERIOD with the end of the dictatorship regime of mobutu sese seko that most of you know ,COMMA life became very ,COMMA very difficult .PERIOD so they started fleeing from the east to the west .PERIOD all my friends said ,COMMA

told me i have to save him everywhere .PERIOD there has been constant extraction of mineral killing animals ,COMMA the logging timbers and so on .PERIOD that is coltan extraction gold mining .PERIOD we have to do it because to let our movement advance after a week ,COMMA we celebrated the birthday of that okapi .PERIOD they killed an elephant ,COMMA just 50 meters to the area where the zoo where okapi was born .PERIOD i devoted half of it to rebuild the herbarium ,COMMA because we didn't have good infrastructure to start plants ,COMMA but is gun industries a tool to rebuild ,COMMA or is it a game ?QUESTIONMARK and they can't go even to university .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD one of the biggest challenges in computer graphics has been being able to create a photo-real digital human face .PERIOD and one of the reasons it is so difficult is that unlike aliens and dinosaurs .PERIOD we look at human faces every day .PERIOD we shoot all of these photographs in about three seconds .PERIOD if we zoom in on this photograph right here ,COMMA we can see .PERIOD it's a really nice photograph to have of her ,COMMA because she is lit from absolutely everywhere at the same time to get a nice image of her facial texture .PERIOD we're just seeing the coarse-scale geometry here .PERIOD and thank you very much .PERIOD we're roughly two days from the entrance at that point ,COMMA otherwise it is completely dark in these places next year .PERIOD i'll be leading an international team to j2 .PERIOD this is one of the places where planetary scientists believe there is a highest probability of the detection of the first life off earth in the ocean that exists below there .PERIOD it's basically a nuclear-heated torpedo .PERIOD one is ,COMMA how do you do ?QUESTIONMARK science ?QUESTIONMARK autonomy underground .PERIOD how do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist ?QUESTIONMARK if it passes the microscopic test we go for a collection ,COMMA no hands at the wheel .PERIOD this is all behavioral autonomy .PERIOD here that's being conducted by the robot on its own .PERIOD that's more than you pay for ted .PERIOD if google dropped their sponsorship ,COMMA there is a place where you can if we're going to get that and make that gas station possible .PERIOD we have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space .PERIOD it has never been done .PERIOD i like this equipment ,COMMA you know ,COMMA and i really value it .PERIOD so we're not going to burn the gear .PERIOD and i'm gonna try and do that within the 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within ,COMMA and to follow the ted commandments .PERIOD that is actually something that creates a near-death experience ,COMMA but near-death is good for

like everybody else ?QUESTIONMARK i used to draw .PERIOD i thought i would be an artist .PERIOD and when you are faced with the prospect of death ,COMMA very soon ,COMMA you begin to think very much about everything .PERIOD so in quantum mechanics ,COMMA of course ,COMMA you have dark energy and dark matter .PERIOD and that's what i look for in my work ,COMMA a personal meaning .PERIOD and they also have to make a living ,COMMA and people need to be fed .PERIOD it may be something that is perhaps more serious -- ,COMMA as i said ,COMMA human rights in burma .PERIOD this leads to this question .PERIOD in this case ,COMMA i was writing a story that included ,COMMA some kind of detail period of history ,COMMA a certain location ,COMMA especially when good things happen .PERIOD and in particular ,COMMA when bad things happen ,COMMA but i do think there's a kind of serendipity ,COMMA and i do want to know what those elements are .PERIOD so i can thank them .PERIOD and also try to find them in my life is it ?QUESTIONMARK because i had the filter that i have such a strong coincidence in writing about these things .PERIOD it takes a while ,COMMA but i have to let go of them and just go there and be there .PERIOD and the reason is that until wonder came along and figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread ,COMMA no one wanted it .PERIOD and when i talk about it ,COMMA i usually pick business because they make the best pictures that you can put in your presentation .PERIOD and because it's the easiest sort of way to keep score .PERIOD well ,COMMA this tv-industrial complex informed ,COMMA my entire childhood and probably yours .PERIOD and i ignored every message because i don't have a pain reliever problem .PERIOD i buy the stuff in the yellow box ,COMMA because i always have consumers don't care about you at all .PERIOD they just don't care because people saw it and said ,COMMA -- .PERIOD i didn't know that was there -- ,COMMA and they noticed it .PERIOD and the thing is people in the fashion business know what it's like to be in the fashion business -- .PERIOD they're used to it .PERIOD the rest of us have to figure out how to think that way how to understand that it's not about interrupting people with big full-page ads ,COMMA or insisting on meetings ,COMMA with people he lived in paris last year .PERIOD he sold 10 million dollars' worth of french bread .PERIOD it was neat .PERIOD it was remarkable and slowly it spread from one person to another person until finally ,COMMA it became the official bread of three-star restaurants in paris .PERIOD they would ignore the geeks ,COMMA and god forbid ,COMMA the laggards to make a product to market .PERIOD an idea to come up with any problem .PERIOD you want to solve that doesn't have a constituency with an otaku is almost impossible .PERIOD krispy kreme has a strategy .PERIOD and what they do is they enter a city .PERIOD they talk to the people with otaku .PERIOD and then they spread through the city to the people who've just crossed the street .PERIOD they're made from cremains .PERIOD oh ,COMMA you like my ring .PERIOD it's my grandmother ,COMMA fastest-growing business in the whole mortuary industry .PERIOD the first one is design is free .PERIOD when you get to scale and the people who come up with stuff ,COMMA that's remarkable more often than not figure out how to put design to work for them .PERIOD silk ,COMMA put a product that does not need to be in the refrigerated section next to the milk in the refrigerated section for the people who were there and looking at that section ,COMMA it was remarkable .PERIOD and i wanted to tell stories about all the amazing things .PERIOD i was seeing underwater ,COMMA incredible wildlife and interesting behaviors .PERIOD and the ice that is there is quite thin .PERIOD these are the tuna ,COMMA the billfish and the sharks .PERIOD but the truth is we're way too efficient at catching them ,COMMA and their stocks have collapsed worldwide .PERIOD so this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner ,COMMA maybe seven or eight shrimp and 10 pounds of other animals that had to die in the process .PERIOD i also wanted to focus on the shark fishing industry because currently on planet earth .PERIOD we're killing over 100 million sharks every single year .PERIOD but before i went out to photograph this component ,COMMA i sort of wrestled with the notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark that will resonate with readers ?QUESTIONMARK you know ,COMMA i think there's still a lot of people out there ,COMMA who think the only good shark is a dead shark .PERIOD one of the locations was this place called tiger beach in the northern bahamas ,COMMA where tiger sharks aggregate in shallow water .PERIOD i also searched on this story for the elusive ,COMMA great hammerhead ,COMMA an animal that really hadn't been photographed much until maybe about seven or 10 years ago .PERIOD but this is crucial habitat ,COMMA and it's where they spend the first two three years of their lives ,COMMA until they're big enough to go out on the rest of the reef .PERIOD i actually jumped in and photographed this .PERIOD and with the fisherman's permission ,COMMA i cut the turtle out ,COMMA and it was able to swim free ,COMMA but you know ,COMMA thousands of other leatherbacks each year are not so fortunate .PERIOD and the species' future is in great danger .PERIOD you can see the coal burning plant in the background .PERIOD i went down there in the winter time ,COMMA and these are animals that had never seen humans before .PERIOD and i was one of the first people they probably had ever seen .PERIOD for example ,COMMA they hoped that certain species of fish like the new zealand snapper would return because they had been fished to the brink of commercial extinction .PERIOD but when the fish came back and began predating and controlling the urchin population low and behold ,COMMA kelp forests emerged in shallow water .PERIOD and that's because the urchins eat kelp little blue cod swimming in for a dash of color .PERIOD the ocean is indeed resilient and tolerant to a point .PERIOD but we must be good custodians ,COMMA but i'm moving past malthus ,COMMA because i think that we just might be about 150 years from a kind of new enlightenment ,COMMA and the world's population expected to top out at something ,COMMA hopefully a bit less than 10 billion late this century .PERIOD but look what happened in europe .PERIOD after the plague rising wages ,COMMA land reform technological innovation ,COMMA birth of the middle class .PERIOD and after that forward-looking social movements ,COMMA like the renaissance and later ,COMMA the enlightenment ,COMMA because transitions are dangerous times fear for the future ,COMMA leads to some rash decisions .PERIOD i was walking in the market one day with my wife ,COMMA and somebody stuck a cage in my face .PERIOD so we're in east borneo .PERIOD this is the place where i started .PERIOD what we did was we formulated recipes -- ,COMMA how to go from a starting situation where you have nothing to a target situation .PERIOD and once the soil gets dried ,COMMA you're in a dry season -- .PERIOD you get cracks oxygen goes in flames ,COMMA come out .PERIOD and the problem starts all over again .PERIOD this is what it looked like for three months .PERIOD we lost all the crops .PERIOD no children gained weight for over a year .PERIOD they lost 12 iq points .PERIOD it was a disaster for orangutans and people that was why i put it as a single point up there .PERIOD you need the bacteria to fix nitrogen ,COMMA and without those microorganisms ,COMMA you won't have any performance at all .PERIOD and we have monitored every single one of those trees from space ,COMMA in the beginning ,COMMA maybe pineapples and beans and corn in the second phase .PERIOD there will be bananas .PERIOD and papayas later on there will be chocolate and chilies .PERIOD and that's green .PERIOD if you look from the tower -- ,COMMA this is when we start attacking the grass air humidity is up 10 percent .PERIOD each of the families that have sold their land .PERIOD now get a piece of land back .PERIOD if one member trespasses the agreement and does cut down trees ,COMMA the other 19 members have to decide what's going to happen to him in north sulawesi .PERIOD it is the cooperative -- .PERIOD they have a democratic culture there .PERIOD so there you can use the local justice system to protect your system .PERIOD they can now sell part of those fruits to the orangutan project .PERIOD now i think the real key to doing it to give a simple answer is integration .PERIOD there's no matter of scale .PERIOD it's not a question of scale .PERIOD it's not a question of financial resources .PERIOD and most of the people are leaving the city and living outside of the city .PERIOD he is invited for a party -- .PERIOD he never wants to leave .PERIOD he's a very demanding person parks ,COMMA -- old quarries that they were transformed into parks .PERIOD so in a city ,COMMA you have to work fast ,COMMA and we cannot have all the answers .PERIOD you see ,COMMA he's right .PERIOD he said ,COMMA there are two types of people in this world ,COMMA those who divide the world into two types .PERIOD and those who do not if you said to them ,COMMA don't do this anymore .PERIOD they'd wonder what you were talking about .PERIOD you have to create the circumstances where they show themselves .PERIOD it means challenging what we take for granted things that we think are obvious .PERIOD he said this in december 1862 to the second annual meeting of congress .PERIOD i ought to explain that .PERIOD i have no idea what was happening at the time .PERIOD so no doubt something fascinating was happening in december 1862 ,COMMA which the americans among us will be aware of ,COMMA you know what it means ,COMMA but our minds are still hypnotized by them .PERIOD and we have to disenthrall ourselves of some of them teenagers do not wear wristwatches .PERIOD she doesn't see the point .PERIOD it has multiple functions .PERIOD everybody who's spoken at ted has told us implicitly or sometimes explicitly ,COMMA a different story that life is not linear .PERIOD it's organic .PERIOD i don't mean you shouldn't go to college ,COMMA but not everybody needs to go and not everybody needs to go .PERIOD now ,COMMA you know ,COMMA to me human communities ,COMMA depend upon a diversity of talent ,COMMA not a singular conception of ability kids sitting in front of unimpressed panels ,COMMA you know ,COMMA with their resumes flipping through and saying ,COMMA well ,COMMA this is it .PERIOD i was very struck by natalie merchant's songs last night recovering old poems .PERIOD it's axiomatic .PERIOD why not us they went on to describe me as america's greenest ceo and theft of our children's future .PERIOD would someday be a crime according to paul and anne ehrlich and a well-known environmental impact equation impact .PERIOD -- a bad thing .PERIOD -- is the product of population ,COMMA affluence and technology .PERIOD paul and anne ehrlich's environmental impact equation .PERIOD i is equal to p times a times ,COMMA t ,COMMA population affluence and technology .PERIOD and i reasoned that if we could make those transformative changes and get rid of t1 altogether ,COMMA we could reduce our impact to zero ,COMMA including our impact on the climate fossil fuel usage is down 60 percent per unit of production .PERIOD due to efficiencies in renewables down 40 percent in our broadloom carpet ,COMMA business ,COMMA which we acquired in 1993 right here in california city of industry ,COMMA where water is so precious .PERIOD we have diverted 148 million pounds -- .PERIOD that's 74000 tons .PERIOD -- of used carpet from landfills closing the loop on material flows through reverse logistics and post-consumer .PERIOD recycling technologies that did not exist .PERIOD when we started 14 years ago ,COMMA costs products people marketplaces -- .PERIOD what else is there ,COMMA but the marketplace was down 36 percent .PERIOD we can see our way now clear to the top of that mountain ,COMMA who is that person ?QUESTIONMARK and we're all acutely aware .PERIOD what's it going to mean in the future ?QUESTIONMARK when we ask someone to pay a hundred dollars for a symphony opera or ballet ticket when that cultural consumer is used to downloading on the internet ,COMMA 24 hours a day for 99 cents a song ,COMMA or for free ,COMMA the arts reformation ,COMMA like the religious reformation is spurred in part by technology ,COMMA with indeed ,COMMA the printing press ,COMMA really leading the charge on the religious reformation .PERIOD this group ,COMMA others have called the pro ams amateur artists doing work at a professional level .PERIOD but i want to be clear ,COMMA just as the religious reformation did not spell the end to the formal church or to the priesthood .PERIOD i believe that our artistic institutions will continue to have importance .PERIOD and indeed ,COMMA i think rather than being annihilated the performing arts are posed on the brink of a time ,COMMA when we will be more important than we have ever been .PERIOD i salute all of you as activists in that quest and urge you to embrace and hold dear the arts in your work ,COMMA whatever your purpose may be .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD manchester craftsmen's guild is named after my neighborhood built in a tough neighborhood ,COMMA where people have been given up for dead .PERIOD my view is that if you want to involve yourself in the life of people who have been given up on ,COMMA you have to look like the solution and not the problem .PERIOD and now that i'm giving speeches at conferences like ted .PERIOD i got put on the board of the carnegie museum .PERIOD well ,COMMA i think that welfare mothers and at-risk kids and ex-steel workers deserve a fountain in their life .PERIOD and he called me into his office -- ,COMMA which is the equivalent of going to see the wizard of oz -- .PERIOD and john heinz had 600 million dollars .PERIOD and at the time i had about 60 cents .PERIOD so at my school ,COMMA we subsidize a gourmet lunch program for welfare mothers in the middle of the inner city ,COMMA because we've discovered that it's good for their stomachs ,COMMA but it's better for their heads .PERIOD i've actually eaten seven of those baskets ,COMMA and they're very good .PERIOD remember ,COMMA i'm the black kid from the '60s who got his life saved with ceramics .PERIOD let me show you what these people do .PERIOD we have a world class gallery ,COMMA because we believe that poor kids need a world class gallery .PERIOD so i designed this thing .PERIOD so he jumped in the van .PERIOD he went to miss jones' house and said ,COMMA miss jones .PERIOD i knew you wanted to come to your kid's art opening ,COMMA but you probably didn't have a ride .PERIOD and there is no statistical difference between the white parents and the black parents .PERIOD she said ,COMMA well ,COMMA i work for a company called hewlett-packard .PERIOD and i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA there's an easy solution to that problem .PERIOD he said ,COMMA because i heard you built the center ,COMMA and i didn't believe that you did it .PERIOD and i wanted to see for myself .PERIOD well ,COMMA we did win .PERIOD and our name was literally in lights over madison square garden .PERIOD and that was our first recording studio ,COMMA which was the broom closet .PERIOD and this is what i want to do .PERIOD when i grow up ,COMMA this is in a place called san francisco .PERIOD and i said ,COMMA herbie ,COMMA this is my concept of a training center for poor people .PERIOD and now i really want to build one .PERIOD and i promised these people that i was going to build this thing ,COMMA and we're going to build it all right .PERIOD and i said ,COMMA if i can follow that music ,COMMA i'll get out into the sunlight ,COMMA and i'll be ok .PERIOD and i don't think i'm crazy so 10 times more bacterial cells than human cells on a human being at the best .PERIOD you're 10 percent human ,COMMA but more likely about one percent human ,COMMA depending on which of these metrics you like .PERIOD and so we wanted to think if there couldn't be a different way that bacteria live .PERIOD what you're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab ,COMMA holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium ,COMMA a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean named vibrio fischeri .PERIOD we just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room .PERIOD and this is what we see .PERIOD but when they grew to a certain cell number all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously .PERIOD the question that we had is how can bacteria these primitive organisms tell the difference from times when they're alone and times when they're in a community ,COMMA and then all do something together .PERIOD this is like the stealth bomber of the ocean .PERIOD and then as the cells grow ,COMMA they're all releasing that molecule into the environment .PERIOD so there's lots of molecule there ,COMMA but the one that's probably the most important to you is virulence .PERIOD this is the vibrio fischeri molecule .PERIOD so then we started to look at other bacteria .PERIOD and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we've discovered .PERIOD the left-hand part of the molecule is identical in every single species of bacteria .PERIOD what that does is to confer ,COMMA exquisite species specificities to these languages .PERIOD each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other each bacteria uses a particular molecule .PERIOD that's its language that allows it to count its own siblings ,COMMA anywhere on your body .PERIOD it looks pretty much like this .PERIOD and what i hope you can see is that there's all kinds of bacteria .PERIOD there couldn't these be new kinds of antibiotics .PERIOD and so now ,COMMA of course ,COMMA we have this global problem in infectious diseases .PERIOD the first one is ,COMMA we've targeted the intraspecies communication system .PERIOD i hope that what you've learned is that bacteria can distinguish self from other .PERIOD this is exactly what happens in your body ,COMMA but then to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria that live on the earth .PERIOD we've also made pro-quorum sensing molecules .PERIOD remember you have these 10 times or more bacterial cells in you or on you keeping you healthy .PERIOD so i'm really a basic scientist ,COMMA not a clinician .PERIOD but in the last year and a half ,COMMA i've started to switch over to use what we've been learning about these patterns of activity to develop prosthetic devices .PERIOD and what i wanted to do today is show you an example of this .PERIOD it's really our first foray into this like this pattern of pulses ,COMMA here actually means baby's face .PERIOD and so when the brain gets this pattern of pulses ,COMMA it knows that what was out there was a baby's face .PERIOD and if it got a different pattern ,COMMA it would know that what was out there was say a dog or another pattern would be a house .PERIOD so this is what we've been working on .PERIOD and this is what our prosthetic does .PERIOD so a completely blind retina ,COMMA even one with no front-end circuitry at all no photoreceptors can now send out normal signals signals that the brain can understand .PERIOD and so with the standard method ,COMMA the cells do fire .PERIOD they just don't fire in the normal firing patterns ,COMMA because they don't have the right code .PERIOD this is just actually the first one that we tried .PERIOD so it's different from the motor prosthetics ,COMMA where you're communicating from the brain to a device .PERIOD here .PERIOD we have to communicate from the outside world into the brain and be understood and be understood by the brain .PERIOD you can just call it out who else the worst flute players .PERIOD actually ,COMMA that was aristotle's answer too peter ,COMMA the greatest benefit to all the greatest benefit to all all right .PERIOD aristotle had a different reason for saying ,COMMA the best flutes should go to the best flute players .PERIOD and the point the essential nature of musical performance is to produce excellent music .PERIOD suppose you were on the supreme court .PERIOD suppose you were deciding the justice of this case ,COMMA raise your hand ,COMMA and we'll try to get you a microphone .PERIOD that's part of the game of golf .PERIOD charlie ,COMMA what do you say to warren warren ?QUESTIONMARK i am not a golfer .PERIOD he wouldn't have granted the cart .PERIOD and he had a very interesting dissent .PERIOD but since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement .PERIOD that is what distinguishes games from productive activity .PERIOD it is quite impossible to say that any of a game's arbitrary rules is essential .PERIOD first ,COMMA no ,COMMA real sports fan would talk that way on the face of it .PERIOD it seemed to be -- .PERIOD this debate about the golf cart .PERIOD -- an argument about fairness .PERIOD what's an unfair advantage ?QUESTIONMARK so if golfing is the kind of game that can be played while riding around in a golf cart ,COMMA it would be hard to confer on the golfing greats ,COMMA the status that we confer the honor and recognition that goes to truly great athletes .PERIOD how many here favor the first policy ?QUESTIONMARK the state should recognize traditional marriage ?QUESTIONMARK only i'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together .PERIOD and actually talk about this a bit more than we do that was easy .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK ok ,COMMA hands up anyone in the audience who's not sure ,COMMA whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing .PERIOD you know ,COMMA a lot of people said ,COMMA well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA city ,COMMA boys have no business telling us rural types .PERIOD what to do with our time ?QUESTIONMARK it's a global trance .PERIOD but the question is ,COMMA are they so dangerous -- ?QUESTIONMARK these risks of doing something about aging -- that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite ,COMMA namely ,COMMA leaving aging as it is .PERIOD people worry about overpopulation .PERIOD they say ,COMMA well ,COMMA if we fix aging ,COMMA no one's going to die to speak of ,COMMA or at least the death toll is going to be much lower only from crossing st giles carelessly .PERIOD this pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things .PERIOD but it isn't .PERIOD so these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live in terms of remaining life expectancy as measured by their health for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive .PERIOD but if you're only 50 ,COMMA then there's a chance that you might be able to pull out of the dive .PERIOD and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA -- -- ,COMMA eventually get through this and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense ,COMMA in terms of your youthfulness ,COMMA both physical and mental ,COMMA and in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes .PERIOD and of course ,COMMA if you're a bit younger than that ,COMMA then you're never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes .PERIOD and that's quite a thought .PERIOD so in other words ,COMMA we add two years -- .PERIOD we treble their remaining lifespan ,COMMA starting from the point that we started the therapies .PERIOD so we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people's attitudes .PERIOD and of course ,COMMA that has enormous implications ,COMMA because the critical thing about this is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology ,COMMA the damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life ,COMMA starting before we're born .PERIOD and the reason it's a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate .PERIOD so these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago .PERIOD and that is pretty good news ,COMMA because it means that you know ,COMMA we've come a long way in biology in these 20 years .PERIOD so the fact that we haven't extended this list is a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done .PERIOD and you know what happened ?QUESTIONMARK but i mean ,COMMA look -- .PERIOD how long does it take to spend that on the war in iraq ?QUESTIONMARK and i think we know how to do it .PERIOD and i'll stop there .PERIOD audience :COLON species on this planet ,COMMA have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases .PERIOD so that individuals live long enough to procreate .PERIOD if i project that that would make me think that i would live until 120 ,COMMA if i don't crash on my motorbike .PERIOD ninety-nine pence was the starting price and no reserve .PERIOD then there was the volcano that interrupted the travel plans of almost all of you and many of your friends ,COMMA including president obama .PERIOD i'm here to tell you the story of audur capital ,COMMA which is a financial firm founded by me and kristin -- ,COMMA who you see in the picture -- in the spring of 2007 ,COMMA just over a year before the economic collapse hit .PERIOD and we believe that doing emotional due diligence is just as important as doing financial due diligence .PERIOD so we like to see profits plus positive social and environmental benefits .PERIOD when we invest now that we've had all that happen ,COMMA and we have all this data out there telling us that it's much better to have diversity around the decision-making tables .PERIOD will we see business and finance change ?QUESTIONMARK i want to see more revolutionary thinking ,COMMA and i remain hopeful for me .PERIOD it was the start of a long journey .PERIOD but i decided that day to matter external debt ,COMMA -- ,COMMA something that i can tell you a long story about because i personally worked on one of the biggest debts on the continent .PERIOD -- has come down dramatically because we are confronted with a challenge .PERIOD we need to bring it back to say ,COMMA what is the combination of all these factors that is going to yield what we want ?QUESTIONMARK and i want to tell you something .PERIOD the issue is not that she was three years old ,COMMA and i was 15 .PERIOD now ,COMMA i put my sister on my back -- ,COMMA burning -- .PERIOD and i walked 10 kilometers with her strapped on my back in about two to three hours .PERIOD she started to move .PERIOD you know ,COMMA we have to use it .PERIOD well ,COMMA for which many people ,COMMA even from other parts of the world are going there to find jobs ,COMMA they are just discovering .PERIOD let's sit down and really tell you where the money should be channeled ,COMMA and where this aid should go .PERIOD how can we get government to combine properly with these private foundations with the international organizations ?QUESTIONMARK and with our private sector aid cannot solve our problems .PERIOD i'm firmly convinced about that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA the chinese minister of finance said to me when i asked him ,COMMA what are we doing wrong in nigeria ,COMMA infrastructure infrastructure ,COMMA infrastructure and discipline ?QUESTIONMARK and i repeat it for the continent .PERIOD and lastly ,COMMA what are you going to do to be part of this partnership of aid ,COMMA government ,COMMA private sector and the african as an individual .PERIOD i will say ,COMMA though that after having done surgery a lot ,COMMA it's somewhat similar to playing a musical instrument .PERIOD and i'll tell you that most scientific studies of music ,COMMA they're very dense .PERIOD and when you actually go through them ,COMMA it's very hard to recognize the music in it that blood flow causes an increase in local blood ,COMMA to that area with a deoxyhemoglobin change .PERIOD in concentration ,COMMA charles limb .PERIOD this is a plastic midi piano keyboard that we use for the jazz experiments .PERIOD and so what we did was we brought professional jazz players to the nih .PERIOD and we had them memorize this piece of music on the left ,COMMA the lower-left -- ,COMMA which is what you heard me playing -- .PERIOD and then we had them improvise to the same exact chord changes .PERIOD and i've listened to that solo 200 times ,COMMA and i still like it .PERIOD and so we had this focal area called the medial prefrontal cortex that went way up in activity .PERIOD we had this broad patch of area called the lateral prefrontal cortex that went way down in activity .PERIOD and i'll summarize that for you here .PERIOD now ,COMMA these are multifunctional areas of the brain .PERIOD the fact that we do it over and over again ,COMMA lets you acclimate to your surroundings .PERIOD so how do you study rap scientifically with this big screen ?QUESTIONMARK you can all rap with me .PERIOD okay ,COMMA he's just memorized a rhyme for us .PERIOD and what we see we do see language areas lighting up ,COMMA but then -- eyes closed -- .PERIOD when you are free-styling versus memorizing ,COMMA you've got major visual areas lighting up .PERIOD you have heightened brain activity when you're doing a comparable task .PERIOD when that one task is creative and the other task is memorized .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA don't get me wrong .PERIOD calculus is an important subject ,COMMA and every student who studies math science engineering economics .PERIOD they should definitely learn calculus by the end of their freshman year of college .PERIOD it's understanding data .PERIOD look .PERIOD the world has changed from analog to digital .PERIOD the majority of our functional brain is distributed over the outer surface layer of the brain ,COMMA and to increase the area that's available for mental capacity .PERIOD the brain surface is highly folded .PERIOD our breakthrough was to create an algorithm that unfolds the cortex so that we can map the signals closer to its source ,COMMA and therefore making it capable of working across a mass population .PERIOD the second challenge is the actual device for observing brainwaves with neutral .PERIOD there's nothing in particular that evan needs to do .PERIOD it takes eight seconds to do this .PERIOD and now that that's done .PERIOD we can choose a movement-based action .PERIOD so evan choose something that you can visualize clearly in your mind .PERIOD so the idea here now is that evan needs to imagine the object coming forward into the screen .PERIOD and there's a progress bar that will scroll across the screen while he's doing that .PERIOD the first time nothing will happen ,COMMA because the system has no idea how he thinks about pull .PERIOD so one ,COMMA two ,COMMA three ,COMMA go .PERIOD okay ,COMMA ah ,COMMA good job .PERIOD that's really amazing .PERIOD so what you want to do -- at least with movement-based actions .PERIOD we do that all the time ,COMMA so you can visualize it .PERIOD so i'd like to show you a few examples ,COMMA because there are many possible applications for this new interface .PERIOD and bed nets have an effect on the epidemic ,COMMA but you're never going to make it extinct with bed nets .PERIOD we could spend hours going over this .PERIOD it creates a very high peak power .PERIOD and it lets you do all kinds of interesting things in particular ,COMMA it lets you find hemozoin and using both this technique and other optical techniques .PERIOD we think we can make those diagnostics .PERIOD we also have another hemozoin-oriented therapy for malaria ,COMMA a way in acute cases to actually take the malaria parasite and filter it out of the blood system .PERIOD you can give drug administration .PERIOD we have all of the precipitation data and the temperature data .PERIOD that's very important because the humidity and precipitation ,COMMA tell you ,COMMA whether you've got standing pools of water for the mosquitoes to breed .PERIOD so that sets the stage on which you do this .PERIOD now ,COMMA one of the ways you can make them .PERIOD not fly is with ddt in 1935 .PERIOD there were 150000 cases a year of malaria in the united states ,COMMA but ddt and a massive public health effort managed to squelch it .PERIOD audience :COLON yeah .PERIOD nathan myhrvold .PERIOD okay .PERIOD so our legal department prepared a disclaimer .PERIOD and here it is .PERIOD now after thinking about this a little bit ,COMMA we thought ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it probably would be simpler to do this with a nonlethal laser .PERIOD we have the device over here .PERIOD now ,COMMA that's a fairly straightforward image processing routine .PERIOD and let me show you how it works .PERIOD this is very satisfying .PERIOD it grows and is nurtured .PERIOD basically ,COMMA a restaurant ,COMMA just like any other chairs ,COMMA recycled and recyclable .PERIOD i was experimenting with these -- .PERIOD i don't know if you can see it -- ,COMMA but there's a work surface there .PERIOD this is the kitchen ,COMMA which is in the same room ,COMMA rather than me putting a dish down .PERIOD they were allowed to help themselves to as much ,COMMA or as little as they wanted .PERIOD this is the waste room in here .PERIOD i have produce and boxes that are unavoidable .PERIOD i'm taking the temperature of the canal outside pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism .PERIOD it's turning through these amazing ,COMMA sails on the roof ,COMMA and that in turn is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant ,COMMA cooling them or heating them as the need may be in the canal ,COMMA which is just outside the restaurant .PERIOD there is hundreds of meters of coil .PERIOD piping .PERIOD he's growing all his own fruit .PERIOD and that's fantastic .PERIOD so you've got to watch your space for that .PERIOD okay .PERIOD so this is my next project .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA the whole thing is is super-sustainable .PERIOD and no one's doing that just yet .PERIOD this is a herd ,COMMA and it is built according to genetical codes .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA it's a new invention of the wheel .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA this is better than a wheel ,COMMA because when you try to drive with your bicycle on the beach ,COMMA you will notice it's very hard to do .PERIOD ok ,COMMA good .PERIOD so ,COMMA as soon it has been to the sea ,COMMA it changes the pattern of zeroes and ones here ,COMMA and it knows always where it is on the beach .PERIOD so it's very simple brain .PERIOD so it's a sort of imagination of the simple world of the beach animal .PERIOD we did haemophilus influenzae .PERIOD and then the smallest genome of a self-replicating organism that of mycoplasma genitalium in 2003 ,COMMA we published our first success ,COMMA so ham smith and clyde hutchison developed some new methods for making error-free dna at a small level .PERIOD and we can walk through the reasons for that .PERIOD but basically ,COMMA the small cell took on the order of one to two months to get results from whereas the larger faster-growing cell takes only two days .PERIOD it's an amazing step forward ,COMMA but we had a problem because now we had the bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast .PERIOD and we thought this would be a great test bed for learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast and transplant them .PERIOD we narrowed it down to one fragment .PERIOD we sequenced it and found just one base pair had been deleted in an essential .PERIOD gene .PERIOD we got a text from dan saying that now the first blue colonies existed .PERIOD so early on ,COMMA we developed the notion of putting in watermarks in the dna to absolutely make clear that the dna was synthetic .PERIOD it's significant to us .PERIOD so when you see how long it took to get an h1n1 vaccine out ,COMMA we think we can shorten that process quite substantially .PERIOD you may have heard about the koran's idea of paradise being 72 virgins .PERIOD and i promise i will come back to those virgins .PERIOD it's just 29 words in arabic ,COMMA but anywhere from 65 to 72 in translation .PERIOD but all is not lost in translation .PERIOD and that number 72 never appears .PERIOD there are no 72 virgins in the koran .PERIOD they all live in colonies consisting of one or a few queens .PERIOD and then all the ants you see walking around are sterile female workers .PERIOD here's my study site .PERIOD this is really a picture of ants .PERIOD and the rabbit just happens to be there .PERIOD ants never make more ants colonies ,COMMA make more colonies .PERIOD and this shows a recently virgin queen .PERIOD here's her wings ,COMMA she lays eggs .PERIOD she feeds the larvae -- .PERIOD so an ant starts as an egg ,COMMA then it's a larva .PERIOD so things happen to an ant colony when it rains in the summer ,COMMA it floods in the desert .PERIOD and that's the process that i call task allocation .PERIOD that is that there are chambers inside .PERIOD they line the walls of the chambers with moist soil ,COMMA and it dries to a kind of an adobe-like surface in it .PERIOD and finally ,COMMA the midden workers put some kind of territorial chemical in the garbage .PERIOD so an ant starts out somewhere near the queen ,COMMA the queen's in there somewhere .PERIOD she just lays eggs .PERIOD so just to reinforce that what you might have thought about ant queens ,COMMA isn't true -- ,COMMA you know ,COMMA even if the queen did have the intelligence to send chemical messages through this whole network of chambers to tell the ants outside ,COMMA what to do there is no way that such messages could make it in time to see the shifts in the allocation of workers that we actually see outside the nest .PERIOD we started out with model airplane paint .PERIOD and then we found these wonderful little japanese markers ,COMMA and they work really well .PERIOD and so just to summarize the result ,COMMA well ,COMMA it turns out that yes ,COMMA the different tasks are interdependent .PERIOD and the second result ,COMMA which was surprising to a lot of people was that ants actually switch tasks .PERIOD the same ant doesn't do the same task over and over its whole life .PERIOD this process changes with colony age ,COMMA and it changes like this .PERIOD instead ,COMMA something about the organization must be changing as the colony gets older .PERIOD and what we're learning is that an ant uses ,COMMA the pattern of its antennal contacts ,COMMA the rate at which it meets ants of other tasks in deciding what to do .PERIOD and we've just recently demonstrated this by putting extract of hydrocarbons on little glass beads and dropping the beads gently down into the nest entrance at the right rate .PERIOD so i want now to show you a bit of film -- .PERIOD and this will start out first of all showing you the nest entrance .PERIOD this is taken through a fiber optics microscope .PERIOD it's down inside the nest each ant ,COMMA then as it comes back in is contacting other ants .PERIOD so what's interesting about this system is that it's messy again .PERIOD i don't want to say that this kind of haphazard pattern of interactions produces a factory that works with the precision and efficiency of clockwork that we can take the whole idea that gave birth to the internet and bring it down to the physical world in this internet zero ,COMMA this internet of devices ,COMMA unlike this screen ,COMMA where the dots are placed carefully .PERIOD this is a raw material .PERIOD this was just a proof of principle .PERIOD he did of tiles that interact magnetically ,COMMA where you write a code ,COMMA much like protein ,COMMA folding that specifies their structure .PERIOD but i had a problem once i had all these machines .PERIOD i was spending too much time teaching students to use them when a user screams into scream ,COMMA buddy ,COMMA their scream is silenced ,COMMA but you don't use it for inventory and payroll .PERIOD dec is now twice bankrupt .PERIOD you don't need personal fabrication in the home to buy what you can buy ,COMMA because you can buy it .PERIOD and the way you close .PERIOD it is not it for the masses .PERIOD but it development for the masses .PERIOD you can see it in their face .PERIOD just this joy of i can do it .PERIOD we designed a network sensor ,COMMA and kids would show up and refuse to leave the lab .PERIOD this is late at ,COMMA you know ,COMMA 11 o'clock at night .PERIOD and i think i was the only person surprised when what she built worked ,COMMA the first time .PERIOD and again ,COMMA that was just for the joy of it .PERIOD and then in turn businesses started to grow like making these antennas .PERIOD we're learning more from them than we're giving them .PERIOD i was showing my kids in a fab lab how to use it .PERIOD real invention is happening in these labs .PERIOD pdps came between mainframes and minicomputers .PERIOD it was there because they wanted to find animals in the mountains ,COMMA but it outgrew it .PERIOD so they built this extraordinary village for the lab .PERIOD if this room full of heroes is just clever enough ,COMMA you can solve the problems .PERIOD the message coming from the fab labs is that the other five billion people on the planet aren't just technical sinks .PERIOD they're sources that has got to be stopped .PERIOD somehow that doesn't seem right .PERIOD so here we are using 20 million barrels a day ,COMMA -- producing eight ,COMMA importing 12 and from the 12 five comes from opec .PERIOD now i had people in washington .PERIOD last week told me ,COMMA he said ,COMMA the saudis can produce the oil for five dollars a barrel .PERIOD we're headed to natural gas ,COMMA run it through the separator ,COMMA and you're ready to use it .PERIOD natural gas will fit all of those .PERIOD it will replace or be able to be used for that .PERIOD so i have tried to target on where we use the natural gas .PERIOD and where i've targeted is on the heavy-duty trucks ,COMMA there are eight million of them .PERIOD i'm back to theorist again .PERIOD so there's nothing going on that impresses me in washington on that plan other than i'm trying to focus on that eight million 18-wheelers .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD that'll make you abandon something .PERIOD i'm a geologist got out of school in '51 .PERIOD and i've been in the industry my entire life .PERIOD i'm not a big natural gas producer .PERIOD you've made the money .PERIOD you need .PERIOD does that make sense .PERIOD the government is not successful on these things .PERIOD but chris ,COMMA i think where we're headed the long-term .PERIOD i don't mind going back to nuclear there .PERIOD isn't anything wrong with nuke tbp fracking ?QUESTIONMARK what is fracking ?QUESTIONMARK i mean ,COMMA seriously ,COMMA the department of energy did not have anything to do with fracking .PERIOD the first frack job was in '47 .PERIOD there's no problems if someone comes to you with a plan that really looks like it might be part of this solution .PERIOD are you ready to invest in those technologies ?QUESTIONMARK even if they aren't maximized for profits ,COMMA they might be maximized for the future health of the planet .PERIOD when you think about resilience and technology ,COMMA it's actually much easier .PERIOD the internet was also very real .PERIOD this is a real way for humans to communicate with each other .PERIOD it's a big deal people on the east coast in 1849 .PERIOD when they first started to get the news .PERIOD they thought ,COMMA ah ,COMMA this isn't real .PERIOD you had dotcom fever ,COMMA and you had gold fever ,COMMA and they wouldn't let the other half out to go look for the first half ,COMMA because they were afraid they wouldn't come back .PERIOD they had bad burn rate in the gold rush a very bad burn rate .PERIOD this is a commercial that was played on the super bowl in the year 2000 bride #1 .PERIOD you said ,COMMA you had a large selection of invitations clerk .PERIOD but we do husband #2 ,COMMA not for another 15 minutes .PERIOD announcer :COLON after all ,COMMA it's your special day ourbeginningcom ,COMMA life's an event ,COMMA announce it to the world .PERIOD so there's a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly optimistic .PERIOD and that analogy is the electric industry .PERIOD this was a huge -- ,COMMA as you would expect -- a huge capital ,COMMA build out .PERIOD well ,COMMA it was because that heavy infrastructure had already been laid down .PERIOD they would -- each room typically had a light bulb socket at the top .PERIOD and there's a rotor there -- that this motor is spinning .PERIOD and they were really happy that the guy had a speakerphone ,COMMA because then they had to wait on hold for an hour to talk to somebody to give them an access code after they got there because you know resilience -- .PERIOD if you think of it in terms of the gold rush ,COMMA then you'd be pretty depressed right now .PERIOD because the last nugget of gold would be gone .PERIOD she -- .PERIOD but ,COMMA you know ,COMMA if you really do believe that it's the very very beginning .PERIOD if you believe ,COMMA it's the 1908 hurley washing machine .PERIOD then you're incredibly optimistic .PERIOD and i do think that that's where we are .PERIOD the golden rule is great .PERIOD i'm a big supporter of both in the beginning .PERIOD there was compassion .PERIOD and i mean ,COMMA not just when human beings first showed up .PERIOD but actually ,COMMA even before that ,COMMA i warned you ,COMMA this was not going to be very warm and fuzzy .PERIOD now there's more good news that came along later in evolution ,COMMA a second kind of evolutionary logic .PERIOD and so you wind up most easily extending compassion to friends and allies .PERIOD so i hope i've got your attention with this promise of good news that may save the world .PERIOD basically ,COMMA a zero-sum game is the kind you're used to in sports ,COMMA where there's a winner and a loser either way your fortunes add up to zero .PERIOD that's a zero-sum game .PERIOD now ,COMMA if you're playing doubles ,COMMA then the person on your side of the net is in a non-zero-sum relationship with you ,COMMA because every point is either good for both of you ,COMMA -- positive win-win ,COMMA -- or bad for both of you ,COMMA it's lose-lose the deployment of the golden rule .PERIOD most naturally happens along these non-zero-sum channels with zero-sum channels ,COMMA you would expect something else ,COMMA but it may .PERIOD and the good news is that history has naturally expanded these webs of non-zero-sumness ,COMMA these webs that can be these channels for compassion .PERIOD that's the story of civilization .PERIOD and also ,COMMA sometimes people don't recognize the non-zero-sum dynamics in the world .PERIOD i think politicians can help foster non-zero-sum relationships .PERIOD economic engagement is generally better than blockades .PERIOD and so on in this regard ,COMMA if there's one thing i can encourage everyone to do politicians ,COMMA religious leaders and us ,COMMA it would be what i call expanding the moral imagination -- that is to say your ability to put yourself in the shoes of people in very different circumstances .PERIOD once upon a time ,COMMA i did a book called how buildings learn .PERIOD so the design problem for today is going to be how do you house an eventual monumental clock like this ?QUESTIONMARK so it can really tick save time beautifully for 100 centuries .PERIOD and it looked like a way to go until you start thinking about what does deep time do to a building ?QUESTIONMARK this is the parthenon .PERIOD it's only 2450 years old .PERIOD and look what happened to it .PERIOD and now it's a pathetic ruin ,COMMA and no one ,COMMA even knows what it was used for underground in a place that's really solid .PERIOD it's right on the eastern border of nevada .PERIOD it starts with the image .PERIOD the image is a picture .PERIOD you have in your mind of the goal at the end of the journey .PERIOD the labyrinth is a concept .PERIOD it's like a twilight zone .PERIOD it's a place where it's difficult ,COMMA where you get disoriented .PERIOD maybe you get scared -- ,COMMA but you have to go through it .PERIOD if you're going to get to some kind of deep reintegration the hillis algorithm .PERIOD 10 factorial gives you that number something .PERIOD you didn't expect that caps what you did expect .PERIOD and then how about a memento number seven ?QUESTIONMARK what are the elements that will most affect your ideas and decisions ?QUESTIONMARK people think they're just the size of shrubs .PERIOD but that's not actually true .PERIOD that's interesting .PERIOD but it goes a mile-and-a-half in a straight line ,COMMA due east into the range into very interesting territory ,COMMA -- ,COMMA except that ,COMMA as you'll see when we go inside in a minute ,COMMA we were hoping for limestone ,COMMA but in there is just shale ,COMMA competent rock is rock that will hold itself up without any shoring .PERIOD you may recognize a couple of the miners there .PERIOD and alexander rose on the left there worked with a bunch of people from the national park to survey the whole mine .PERIOD it's a mile deep ,COMMA kurt bollacker .PERIOD and alexander rose designed a radically wireless station ,COMMA but there's no bears .PERIOD and there's no poison oak ,COMMA and there's basically no people ,COMMA because this place has been empty for a long time .PERIOD well ,COMMA here's a potential approach .PERIOD you need to come up the lincoln canyon .PERIOD it's a secret passage .PERIOD it's like something from tolkien .PERIOD and then ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the next thing i hear is i've made it to the top .PERIOD you can see all of creation from up here .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA there he is .PERIOD that's alexander rose .PERIOD this discovery changed everything about our sense of these cliffs and what to do with them .PERIOD so ,COMMA even with the slowing of the rotation of the earth and so on ,COMMA the clock will keep perfectly good time .PERIOD so here we're looking from the south look north over on the eastern side .PERIOD it's gentle as you can see .PERIOD and that's not snow -- .PERIOD that's what the white limestone looks like .PERIOD another is the experience in the mountain .PERIOD and the third is the experience from the mountain ,COMMA which is really dominated by the view ,COMMA shed of the spring valley there behind danny .PERIOD and if you look off to the right out there ,COMMA 15 miles across to the schell creek range ,COMMA this is rocky mountain junipers that have been there for thousands of years .PERIOD ok ,COMMA let's take one more look at the mountain itself .PERIOD and this stone takes a perfect polish .PERIOD most of the amazingness of the clock .PERIOD we can borrow from the amazingness of the mountain ,COMMA and often i'm driving in a taxi ,COMMA and i see a hole in a shirt or something that looks very interesting ,COMMA or pretty or functional in some way that i'd never seen happen before .PERIOD i don't know where inspiration comes from .PERIOD and i think about ,COMMA you know ,COMMA their roles ,COMMA and about how you have to like ,COMMA watch what your daughters look at .PERIOD so actually check this out .PERIOD i was dating this guy ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK i was dating this guy ,COMMA and it was going on for about a year right ?QUESTIONMARK and i kind of try not to look back ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK and ,COMMA frankly ,COMMA i don't really know what to call myself too much time on computer bridge ,COMMA which is ,COMMA you know ,COMMA like that's .PERIOD so somehow ,COMMA like about ten years ago ,COMMA i thought that the most unboring place in the world would be like a tv studio like for a day show some kind of day talk show ,COMMA because it's all of these things that i love all kind of in one place .PERIOD hi ,COMMA there rod cutting hair ,COMMA just checking because some people want to look ,COMMA you know ,COMMA aggressively ugly a .PERIOD oh ,COMMA no ,COMMA we're just staging rod .PERIOD we're just staging it .PERIOD i'll tell you that i cook a lot .PERIOD also ,COMMA i love to cook .PERIOD this is what i've been doing ,COMMA because i think it's the most fun thing in the world .PERIOD it's got a lot of different things on it .PERIOD yeah .PERIOD but i can never find buttermilk ever chef for cream .PERIOD have you ever wondered how such a situation can be turned around ?QUESTIONMARK have you ever looked at the arab uprisings and thought ?QUESTIONMARK how could we have predicted that ?QUESTIONMARK but i believe now that we're moving into a new age ,COMMA and that age the new york times ,COMMA dubbed recently as the age of behavior and these ideas and narratives that bump people across borders are increasingly beginning to affect the way in which people behave .PERIOD if we look at islamists ,COMMA if we look at the phenomenon of far-right fascists ,COMMA one thing ,COMMA they've been very good at one thing that they've actually been exceeding in is communicating across borders ,COMMA using technologies to organize themselves to propagate ,COMMA their message and to create truly global phenomena .PERIOD but having been born in essex at the age of 16 ,COMMA i joined an organization by the age of 24 .PERIOD i found myself convicted in prison in egypt ,COMMA being blacklisted from three countries in the world for attempting to overthrow their governments ,COMMA being subjected to torture in egyptian jails and sentenced to five years as a prisoner of conscience ,COMMA the age of behavior where ideas and narratives were increasingly defining behavior and identity and allegiances in certain countries .PERIOD mosque minarets are being banned ,COMMA and why are democracy aspirants falling behind so the ideas ?QUESTIONMARK and the narratives of al-qaeda come to your mind immediately .PERIOD one of their leaders was killed in pakistan .PERIOD recently to go around saying that i believe democratic culture is the best that we've arrived at as a form of political organizing is associated with extremism .PERIOD when talking about those reasons ,COMMA let's break down certain preconceptions ,COMMA but without freedom of speech ,COMMA you can't have free and fair elections in the '80s and '90s .PERIOD when islamism started in the region ,COMMA it spread across the mena region as a whole .PERIOD now ,COMMA that's a big claim .PERIOD i'm going to try to back it up slow text-based conversations ,COMMA then real-time voice based conversations .PERIOD he traces the edges of the individual networks ,COMMA and then color codes them .PERIOD but they weren't given that choice because their own citizens beat them to the punch ,COMMA essentially to say we will do anything to placate .PERIOD you just please stop protesting in public .PERIOD and so the protest kept going .PERIOD and so they began to arrest .PERIOD the protesters .PERIOD all of that is over .PERIOD he had said in january that he would not sign a bill that granted telecom immunity for possibly warrantless spying on american persons .PERIOD it was senator obama when they created it .PERIOD they changed the name later .PERIOD he had to issue a reply .PERIOD and he said ,COMMA essentially ,COMMA i have considered the issue media .PERIOD the media landscape that we knew as familiar as it was as easy ,COMMA conceptually as it was to deal with the idea that professionals broadcast messages to amateurs is increasingly slipping away .PERIOD that's the media environment we've got .PERIOD and today ,COMMA after the global economic crisis ,COMMA there was a whole new set of rules about how the state should intervene .PERIOD the first to my mind is what i call as the ideas that have arrived .PERIOD we thought of people as a liability .PERIOD this change has contributed to the vitality and the whole economy .PERIOD and the fact that we have english is now becoming a huge strategic asset .PERIOD one is the question of education .PERIOD the third thing is ,COMMA again ,COMMA cities .PERIOD but today ,COMMA finally ,COMMA after economic reforms and economic growth ,COMMA i think the notion that cities are engines of economic growth .PERIOD cities are engines of creativity .PERIOD cities are engines of innovation ,COMMA have finally been accepted .PERIOD a lot of the indian problems are related to the ideology of caste and other things .PERIOD therefore ,COMMA we will fundamentally rethink the way we look at the environment ,COMMA the way we look at energy ,COMMA the way we create whole new paradigms of development .PERIOD why does what's happening 10 thousand miles away matter to all of you ?QUESTIONMARK and that makes a huge difference when india was growing at about three 35 percent .PERIOD and the population was growing at two percent .PERIOD its per capita income was doubling every 45 years .PERIOD i've been there six times four times .PERIOD i did work with national geographic making tectonic plate measurements twice .PERIOD i went with nasa doing remote sensing devices that gives you an idea of just how severe things are near the summit .PERIOD there were three other expeditions on the mountain ,COMMA an american team ,COMMA a new zealand team and an imax team .PERIOD and from there ,COMMA we climb up to camp two ,COMMA which is sort of the foreground .PERIOD if you notice ,COMMA the summit of everest is black .PERIOD this is not good weather to climb in .PERIOD so the climbers are just waiting hoping that the wind's going to die down .PERIOD the summit would be in the foreground .PERIOD but what happened that year was the wind suddenly and unexpectedly picked up .PERIOD i have an oxygen hose connected here .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK this is a view taken on the summit ridge itself ,COMMA but either way you fall for the rest of your life .PERIOD this is taken from camp three ,COMMA where i was .PERIOD so as the climbers came by me ,COMMA i sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition to continue on further down .PERIOD his wife was home in new zealand ,COMMA seven months pregnant with their first child ,COMMA and rob asked to be patched into her that was done and rob and his wife had their last conversation .PERIOD it's a tackle box filled with medical supplies .PERIOD what we did was try to warm them up as best .PERIOD we could put oxygen on them and try to revive them ,COMMA which is difficult to do at 21000 feet .PERIOD when the tent is freezing .PERIOD as i was taking care of these climbers ,COMMA we got a startling experience ,COMMA but beck wasn't dead .PERIOD he heard that ,COMMA but he was completely unable to move .PERIOD now you go to this one ,COMMA and you see how much more the frontal lobes are lighting up .PERIOD he's trying to get his muscles going and get out of this .PERIOD it's too cold .PERIOD he can't keep his metabolic fires going .PERIOD and you see ,COMMA there's no more red here .PERIOD his brain is quieting down .PERIOD he's thinking about what he's got to do to save himself .PERIOD he's not thinking about his family now .PERIOD and he's getting himself motivated .PERIOD a helicopter came in at 21000 feet and carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history .PERIOD it's our trailer ,COMMA because i know ,COMMA obviously you guys are busy .PERIOD many of you may not have had a chance to see it if we could roll michael moriarty's wife .PERIOD it's really hard for him to not have his dad .PERIOD they're shooting at me ,COMMA deborah scranton .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD we were one of the lucky ones to get in the class with the sony cameras and the vista software .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA we were there for an hour talking ,COMMA and it really highlighted something that i would like to ask you guys to think about .PERIOD and hopefully to help with ,COMMA which is ,COMMA i think a lot of us are very afraid to have conversations about war and about politics .PERIOD how do we open it up to really be able to have a conversation ?QUESTIONMARK it was mass casualties .PERIOD this is blood ,COMMA five soldiers filmed the entire time .PERIOD they spent their entire day outside the wire ,COMMA trying to save iraqi lives -- the iraqis who work on the post .PERIOD and for me ,COMMA it's trying to bridge that disconnect .PERIOD i get -- .PERIOD i'm often asked ,COMMA you know ,COMMA for me ,COMMA what have been some of the special moments from having worked on this film ?QUESTIONMARK and he looked at me and i smiled .PERIOD and then i saw the tears start welling up in his eyes .PERIOD so when i talk about a disconnect ,COMMA it's not only for maybe those people who don't know a soldier ,COMMA which there obviously are .PERIOD you know these days .PERIOD it's not like world war ii ,COMMA where there was a war front and a home front and everybody seemed involved .PERIOD do you give money to any of the charities do you really care ?QUESTIONMARK and it was something called ecorock ,COMMA and they worked absolutely very ,COMMA very ,COMMA very hard .PERIOD that's the finished production line there .PERIOD we must change everything .PERIOD so let's first talk about focused ultrasound .PERIOD and i hold in my hand ,COMMA a tissue-mimicking phantom .PERIOD it is transparent made just for you .PERIOD this is a setup .PERIOD i put in a physics lab .PERIOD we need to reach a target inside the brain .PERIOD but you may not know that he tried to perform lobotomies in the brain noninvasively with focused ultrasound in the '50s .PERIOD and it makes you ponder why those pioneers failed .PERIOD they were missing the vision .PERIOD it is approved under an fdaide at the university of virginia in charlottesville ,COMMA using focused ultrasound to ablate a point in his thalamus .PERIOD we attach a transducer in this case to the brain ,COMMA but if it will be a different organ ,COMMA it will be a different transducer attached to the patient .PERIOD it's a target in the thalamus .PERIOD it doesn't do any damage ,COMMA but it elevates the temperature by a few degrees .PERIOD but here we can get both the anatomical imaging and the temperature maps in real time .PERIOD so once the physician verifies that the focus spot is on the target he has chosen .PERIOD then we move to perform a full-energy ablation like you see here .PERIOD and you have to understand what is in people's mind when they are willing to take the risk ,COMMA they drove like three hours from their farm to the hospital .PERIOD so again ,COMMA this is an immediate relief .PERIOD i don't see without this nation ,COMMA taking it as some collective will or something .PERIOD that is a national goal to make that happen .PERIOD it will not happen ,COMMA and it's not just because of regulation .PERIOD it's because of the amount of money needed under the current ,COMMA evidence-based medicine and the size of trials and so on to make it happen .PERIOD and we have better-than-surgery results in breasts ,COMMA women suffer from that disease .PERIOD in the fashion industry ,COMMA there's very little intellectual property protection .PERIOD it's because it's a lot harder for knock-off artists to knock off these designs ,COMMA because they can't knock off the logo .PERIOD now ,COMMA the reason for this ,COMMA the reason that the fashion industry doesn't have any copyright protection is because the courts decided long ago that apparel is too utilitarian to qualify for copyright protection .PERIOD now ,COMMA fashion designers have the broadest palette imaginable in this creative industry .PERIOD people think this is a magical thing .PERIOD how does it happen ?QUESTIONMARK johanna blakley .PERIOD imagine that they make deals with the fast fashion giants .PERIOD and they come up with a way to sell their product to a whole new demographic .PERIOD the santee alley demographic very low novelty ,COMMA standard .PERIOD anybody can register anything that is a very difficult question to answer fireworks displays ,COMMA the rules of games ,COMMA the smell of perfume .PERIOD no ,COMMA it is more complex than this .PERIOD but this will do .PERIOD the problem is that digital technology has completely subverted .PERIOD the logic of this physically fixed expression versus idea .PERIOD concept :COLON this individual lives in the atacama desert in chile .PERIOD and it happens to be 3000 years old .PERIOD and i'm also trying to create a means in which to step outside our quotidian experience of time ,COMMA and to start to consider a deeper timescale .PERIOD i'd been traveling in japan without an agenda other than to photograph .PERIOD and then i heard about this tree that is 2180 years old and knew that i had to go visit it .PERIOD this is a clonal tree as well .PERIOD i spoke to the biologist who discovered this tree ,COMMA and he told me that that spindly growth you see there in the center is most likely a product of climate change .PERIOD does anybody know how old the oldest tortoise is -- any guesses ?QUESTIONMARK and then you might have heard of this giant clam that was discovered off the coast of northern iceland that reached 405 years old .PERIOD however ,COMMA it died in the lab as they were determining its age .PERIOD i had the opportunity to travel around the limpopo province in south africa with an expert in baobab trees .PERIOD they contain thousands of years of their own histories within themselves .PERIOD and they also contain records of natural and human events ,COMMA and it actually never sheds those leaves .PERIOD so it also bears the distinction of having the longest leaves in the plant kingdom .PERIOD this is something called an underground forest .PERIOD the tree can easily recover .PERIOD but what's unique about it is that it's doing dna ,COMMA repair below freezing .PERIOD it's my hope that by going to find these organisms that i can help draw attention to their remarkable resilience and help play a part in insuring .PERIOD their continued longevity into the foreseeable future ,COMMA our leaders and ourselves want everything .PERIOD but we don't talk about the costs .PERIOD and when we would gather as fellows ,COMMA she would push us to think about how the elders in native american culture make decisions .PERIOD they said ,COMMA they would try so hard to remember the fragments of the dance ,COMMA hoping that others were alive and doing the same .PERIOD but we find those entrepreneurs who put people and the planet before profit .PERIOD and it's only when we honor them and celebrate them and give them status that the world will really change for two years .PERIOD he hardly made any money ,COMMA a tiny stipend .PERIOD but he apprenticed with this incredible housing developer named tasneem saddiqui .PERIOD he said ,COMMA long story .PERIOD we can take the easier road the more cynical road ,COMMA which is a road based on sometimes dreams of a past that never really was a fear of each other distancing and blame .PERIOD i had the great honor of working with the child psychologist dr .PERIOD robert coles who stood up for change during the civil rights movement in the united states .PERIOD my final story is about a young beautiful man named

.PERIOD and he said to me at the end of his year jacqueline ,COMMA it was so humbling ,COMMA because i thought as a farmer .PERIOD and as an african ,COMMA i would understand how to transcend culture .PERIOD robert kennedy once said that few of us have the greatness to bend history itself .PERIOD but each of us can work to change a small portion of events ,COMMA but we do not know his face .PERIOD i find that hard to believe it also has to be sufficiently detailed .PERIOD all we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self-portrait .PERIOD and look ,COMMA they are very similar .PERIOD they are made in the right order .PERIOD it has stored recorded can fastly retrieve the meanings of thousands ,COMMA tens of thousands of objects ,COMMA actions and their relationships

result in a wonderful differentiation in humankind in the way that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA no ,COMMA two of us are quite alike .PERIOD and we try to track the changes that occur as the new skill or ability is acquired from these studies .PERIOD we defined two great epochs of the plastic history of the brain .PERIOD and that is the period in which the brain is setting up in its initial form

he's successful in his retrieval of food with this tool ,COMMA every time we can look down in the brain of the monkey .PERIOD we've actually distorted the map by the exercise and each one of them changes in ways that are specific to the skill or ability .PERIOD it represents changes of hundreds of millions ,COMMA possibly billions of synaptic connections in your brain .PERIOD that is why you

different in the details from the brain of the average individual 1000 years ago .PERIOD it's not english .PERIOD it's noisy english ,COMMA changing it in detail .PERIOD it takes about 30 hours on .PERIOD the average .PERIOD you can see that most of the children on the left side of the distribution are moving into the middle or the right .PERIOD this is a substantially large impact .PERIOD i'm

must do is ,COMMA i think we must all walk to the end of our lives and turn around and ask ourselves a most fundamental question .PERIOD you take about eight or so carbon atoms about 20 hydrogen atoms .PERIOD you put them together in exactly the right way .PERIOD and you get this marvelous liquid very energy-dense ,COMMA and very easy to refine into a number of very useful products and fuels

i'm going to do a bad southern accent .PERIOD i have a story a story that i would like to share with you ,COMMA and it's an african story .PERIOD and so maybe you're thinking now ,COMMA why how an italian filmmaker based in boston is so interested in this story ?QUESTIONMARK and i was born in zambia .PERIOD i have the good fortune of being a filmmaker-in-residence at the center of digital imaging arts at boston university .PERIOD there are several themes from the documentary ,COMMA but they are re-edited and made for you .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK milverton nwokedi ,COMMA you cut a nice movie with just 10000 dollars in nigeria here .PERIOD they can afford to watch their robocop and whatever because nobody believed that nollywood can come out of africa .PERIOD narrator :COLON suspense fun and intrigue .PERIOD it's the blockbuster comedy .PERIOD it is not what you hear ,COMMA you know ,COMMA from the western press .PERIOD man ,COMMA let's go like they go here now .PERIOD now ,COMMA you see the gun there ,COMMA but you won't see any guns shot .PERIOD we use knock-out kevin books :COLON ikeduba .PERIOD what i'm scared of is just the explosion will come up in my face .PERIOD you know ,COMMA this is nollywood where the magic lives ,COMMA but always with a smile always with an enthusiasm that is incredible .PERIOD the nigerian filmmakers really really are doing what they like .PERIOD and so it's a very ,COMMA very important thing for them ,COMMA and for their audiences ,COMMA filmmakers friends of mine ,COMMA they look at nollywood ,COMMA and they say ,COMMA wow ,COMMA they are doing what we really want to do and make a buck and live with this job .PERIOD no stories around the campfire ,COMMA difficult .PERIOD eh .PERIOD it's meaningless .PERIOD i think that the key to a healthy society is a thriving community of storytellers .PERIOD and i think that the nigerian filmmakers really have proved this it’s ,COMMA not an added sequence ,COMMA just some voices from nollywood .PERIOD and we know that there are more .PERIOD they can be rented for pennies .PERIOD you can be in a lagos traffic jam ,COMMA and you can buy a movie or some bananas or some water .PERIOD yes ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA it appeared in a porno comic book ,COMMA which is the slide on the right on the left-hand side ,COMMA i had the context of those little houses ,COMMA and i tried to build a building that fit into that context .PERIOD and then i did a law school for loyola in downtown la .PERIOD and it was my theory ,COMMA or my point of view that one didn't upstage the neighborhood .PERIOD -- one made accommodations .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA the story i tell is that i got mad at postmodernism -- at po-mo -- and said that fish were 500 million years earlier than man .PERIOD and if you're going to go back ,COMMA we might as well go back to the beginning .PERIOD and so i started making these funny things .PERIOD and the client said ,COMMA why no fish .PERIOD it was a dialog with the context .PERIOD again ,COMMA couldn't find it .PERIOD so ,COMMA and it's one of the nicest pieces i've ever made .PERIOD i think ,COMMA for reasons we don't want to talk about it got delayed .PERIOD i went around toronto and found a bathtub like my grandmother's ,COMMA and i put the fish in .PERIOD and we've started to work on things .PERIOD the highlight of the performance was at the end .PERIOD and so i did a lot of dirty things with chain link ,COMMA which nobody will forgive me for .PERIOD it's in perspective and everything .PERIOD but we were trying to collide our ideas to put objects next to each other ,COMMA like a morandi -- ,COMMA like the little bottles -- composing them like a still life .PERIOD and he pushed that ,COMMA and it was this interaction between that kind of up-the-ante stuff that became pretty interesting .PERIOD and i still think the time magazine picture will be of the binoculars .PERIOD you know ,COMMA leaving out the -- ,COMMA what the hell ?QUESTIONMARK i said ,COMMA if i can't get the craft that i want ,COMMA i'll use the craft .PERIOD i can get .PERIOD and it was all of one material ,COMMA and the metal could go on the roof as well as the walls .PERIOD i was given an opportunity to design an exhibit for the metalworkers' unions of america and canada in washington .PERIOD and i did it on the condition that they become my partners in the future and help me with all future metal buildings ,COMMA etc .PERIOD etc .PERIOD and then more metal and some chain link in santa monica -- ,COMMA a little shopping center ,COMMA it gave me an opportunity to make a sculpture out of it .PERIOD when you have to do something really cheaply .PERIOD it's hard to get perfect corners and stuff .PERIOD he didn't recommend me by the way i keep trying to make it work .PERIOD it's never been finished .PERIOD this is the city hall over here somewhere .PERIOD and the courthouse sohio is on the axis here .PERIOD and we followed the axis ,COMMA and they're two kind of goalposts .PERIOD and all this stuff at the bottom is a museum and an idea for a very fancy ,COMMA automobile entry .PERIOD and following that basic idea of the village ,COMMA we changed it as we got into it .PERIOD that's the living room .PERIOD you come down from this level along the stairway ,COMMA and you enter the bedroom here going into the lake .PERIOD these stonehenge things were designed to give foreground and to create a greater depth in this shallow lot .PERIOD i was trying to get around this plan ,COMMA coupe -- .PERIOD how do you do it ?QUESTIONMARK jay chiat is a glutton for punishment .PERIOD and he hired me to do a house for him in the hamptons .PERIOD and then this is a kind of a shopping mall with a rodeo and restaurants .PERIOD it has a chamber hall .PERIOD there's commercial at the ground floor .PERIOD the acoustician in the competition gave us criteria ,COMMA which led to this compartmentalized scheme ,COMMA which we found out after the competition would not work at all .PERIOD and the ritz-carlton tower is being designed with exposed steel non-fire proof ,COMMA much like those old gas tanks ,COMMA and the food wasn't as good as the stuff .PERIOD and so it failed .PERIOD thank you very much .PERIOD i know bill joy was talking to you about the wonders of carbon nanotubes .PERIOD so i'm going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro-tubes ,COMMA which is charcoal .PERIOD what we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel that would be something that people could easily cook with something like charcoal .PERIOD after some time ,COMMA after setting it on fire ,COMMA you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln .PERIOD and then you end up with this carbonized material here ,COMMA however ,COMMA you can't burn this .PERIOD it's too fine ,COMMA and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking .PERIOD so we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes ,COMMA compared to the sugarcane charcoal ,COMMA where we actually have to teach people how to form it into briquettes .PERIOD and you have the extra step of cooking ,COMMA the binder ,COMMA this comes pre-briquetted .PERIOD but this is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits .PERIOD they can generate income from this .PERIOD they can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal ,COMMA and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who aren't making their own .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA the world where advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles that are made by hand .PERIOD and where when you work 10 hours a day ,COMMA you're still only earning 60 dollars in a month .PERIOD and more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day .PERIOD do you need to find entrepreneurs or venture capitalists ?QUESTIONMARK or what do you need to take what you've got and get it to scale ?QUESTIONMARK these are some of my kids with a salad bar .PERIOD and the very first thing was about regional food ,COMMA -- ,COMMA trying to eat food from within our region .PERIOD we can't keep feeding our kids ,COMMA pesticides and herbicides and antibiotics and hormones .PERIOD the usda allows these antibiotics ,COMMA these hormones and these pesticides in our food supply ,COMMA and the usda paid for this ad in time magazine .PERIOD it's no wonder ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we have criminals .PERIOD what goes in is what we are .PERIOD the cdc .PERIOD the center for disease control

,COMMA and some kind of cupcakes .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA this may be what a lot of parents serve as opposed to -- .PERIOD this is what we try and serve .PERIOD there's not a strawberry tree or a carrot bush .PERIOD you're not going to get the next generation ,COMMA or the generation after to be able to think like this ,COMMA if they're not nourished .PERIOD and these calendars really started to lay out my program ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we have to change it .PERIOD we have to teach kids that if they're on a diet of refined sugar ,COMMA they go up and down ,COMMA just like ,COMMA if they're on a diet of crack .PERIOD and we have to pull it all together .PERIOD we have composting in all of our schools ,COMMA because you know what many of us are sort of at the end of our careers .PERIOD and we need to be giving these kids -- .PERIOD these young kids ,COMMA the next generation -- ,COMMA the tools to save themselves and save the planet .PERIOD i had 90 employees in this country .PERIOD we're spending 110 billion dollars a year on fast food that 8 billion comes down to two dollars and 49 cents -- .PERIOD that's what the government allocates for lunch .PERIOD and those are the same kids who

that i'm a happy person .PERIOD he maintained a calm insouciance .PERIOD we can categorize it like that ,COMMA because you might say ,COMMA well ,COMMA this type of surgery might be regarded as cosmetic .PERIOD i'll move it off .PERIOD and we'll have a blank slide for those who are squeamish amongst you .PERIOD and again ,COMMA as i told you ,COMMA if they have a caring family and good work life ,COMMA then they can lead normal and fulfilled lives .PERIOD so it's not simply a western phenomenon .PERIOD we make judgments on people's faces .PERIOD all the time .PERIOD good-looking people are always judged as being more friendly .PERIOD this is an image of ann ,COMMA who's had her right jaw removed and the base of her skull removed .PERIOD so it's very valuable to have that tool in our armamentarium ,COMMA but the patients are going to have to take drugs that suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives .PERIOD we're still not curing enough patients -- .PERIOD it's the most disfiguring cancer .PERIOD we still can't get rid of scars .PERIOD whereas i felt that when you design you either improve ,COMMA or you create a detriment to the community in which you're designing in working within the united states ,COMMA most people look at poverty ,COMMA and they see the face of a foreigner ,COMMA but go live -- .PERIOD i live in bozeman montana ,COMMA -- go up to the north plains on the reservations ,COMMA or go down to alabama or mississippi pre-katrina .PERIOD and i could have shown you places that have far worse conditions than many developing countries .PERIOD i've been to so in the past seven years -- .PERIOD this isn't just about nonprofit .PERIOD what it showed me is that there's a grassroots movement going on of socially responsible designers who really believe that this world has got a lot smaller ,COMMA and that we have the opportunity -- ,COMMA not the responsibility ,COMMA but the opportunity -- to really get involved in making change .PERIOD so it's really important that if we're designing and trying to create change ,COMMA we build that change .PERIOD and it wasn't doctors telling us this .PERIOD it was actual villagers that we were staying with .PERIOD we just don't know how to show this ,COMMA and on the fourth week ,COMMA the doctors come and they mow out ,COMMA an area ,COMMA put a tensile structure on the top .PERIOD and when the doctors have finished treating and seeing patients and villagers ,COMMA you cut down the clinic and you eat it .PERIOD it's an eat your own clinic ,COMMA and you have to keep the maintenance down .PERIOD and so we decided to look at the idea of sports and create a youth sports center that doubled as an hiv/aids outreach center .PERIOD and the coaches of the girls' team were also trained doctors .PERIOD so this is the designer .PERIOD he's out there working with the first ever women's soccer team in kwa-zulu natal siyathemba ,COMMA and they can tell it better video .PERIOD well ,COMMA my name is sisi because i work at the african center .PERIOD this was a connection ,COMMA just a meeting with somebody who wanted to develop africa's first telemedicine center in

do nothing about the housing crisis that's about to happen in 20 years .PERIOD one in three people will live in an unplanned settlement ,COMMA or a refugee camp .PERIOD look left .PERIOD look right .PERIOD one of you will be there .PERIOD and i want this whole thing to work multi-lingually .PERIOD the idea of needs-based ,COMMA competitions ,COMMA -- x-prize for the other 98 percent .PERIOD if you want to call it that ,COMMA we also want to look at ways of matchmaking and putting funding partners together .PERIOD there should be a sheet .PERIOD i don't have time to read this because i'm going to be yanked off .PERIOD so i'm going to speak about a problem that i have .PERIOD and that's that i'm a philosopher ,COMMA and i get hoots of derision and cackles and growls ,COMMA because they think that's impossible .PERIOD you can't explain consciousness .PERIOD my late lamented friend ,COMMA bob nozick ,COMMA a fine philosopher ,COMMA in one of his books ,COMMA philosophical explanations is commenting on the ethos of philosophy ,COMMA -- ,COMMA the way ,COMMA philosophers go about their business .PERIOD i'm sure that people here who work on say ,COMMA climate change and global warming ,COMMA or on the future of the internet encounter people who have very strong opinions about what's going to happen next .PERIOD but with regard to consciousness ,COMMA people seem to think each of us seems to think i am an expert ,COMMA no other ingredients .PERIOD at all ,COMMA we're just made of cells about 100 trillion of them ,COMMA the content -- .PERIOD there's color ,COMMA there's ideas ,COMMA there's memories .PERIOD there's history .PERIOD and somehow all that content of consciousness is accomplished by the busy activity of those hoards of neurons .PERIOD so this is the problem .PERIOD so i have to do a little bit of the sort of work that a lot of you won't like for the same reason that you don't like to see a magic trick explained to you .PERIOD it's one that i predicted in the last page ,COMMA or two of my 1991 book .PERIOD consciousness explained where i said ,COMMA if you did experiments of this sort ,COMMA you'd find that people were unable to pick up really large changes .PERIOD and as i walked towards the picture ,COMMA i was expecting detail that wasn't there .PERIOD you're familiar with a more recent technology ,COMMA which is -- there .PERIOD you can get a better view of the blobs .PERIOD now ,COMMA what does your brain do when it takes the suggestion ?QUESTIONMARK i don't think so not a chance .PERIOD but then how on earth is it done ?QUESTIONMARK it's the same thing .PERIOD the brain isn't actually putting the detail in your head at all is the shape on the left ,COMMA the same as the shape on the right rotated .PERIOD yes .PERIOD and if you read that literature ,COMMA one of the things that you really have to come to terms with is even when you're the subject in the experiment .PERIOD you don't know .PERIOD well ,COMMA that's where you have to go backstage .PERIOD and ask the magician ,COMMA how many of you see that sort of boundary with the necker cube floating in front of the circles ?QUESTIONMARK can you see it when you see the cube one way behind the screen ?QUESTIONMARK those boundaries go away .PERIOD and i supposed that that was just a flat truth always true .PERIOD let me just pause this for a second ,COMMA if i can .PERIOD so now we're going to be subjects in the experiment .PERIOD audience :COLON yes .PERIOD so 155 seconds is the median time for subjects in his experiment there ,COMMA how many still don't see it ?QUESTIONMARK how many still don't see it ?QUESTIONMARK thank you very much .PERIOD and i ever met more humble people ,COMMA the mosque where the respectful foreigner is showered with blessings and with tears and welcomed as a gift .PERIOD what do we know about the women 10 years after the war ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA the thesis of the bottom billion is that a billion people have been stuck living in economies that have been stagnant for 40 years ,COMMA and hence ,COMMA diverging from the rest of mankind .PERIOD the last time ,COMMA the rich world got serious about developing .PERIOD another region was in the late 1940s .PERIOD yes ,COMMA you tear up the eleventh commandment ,COMMA -- national sovereignty .PERIOD we need to be at least as serious as we were .PERIOD then the commodity booms are pumping unprecedented amounts of money into many ,COMMA though ,COMMA not all of the countries of the bottom billion .PERIOD so a mass of new discoveries just to give you .PERIOD one example .PERIOD angola alone is getting 50 billion dollars a year in oil revenue .PERIOD so here comes a bit of science .PERIOD and this is a bit of science i've done since the bottom billion .PERIOD so it's new come back 15 years later ,COMMA you know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment ,COMMA how they've been sold over the last 40 years ,COMMA a company flies in does a deal with a minister .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD i was an unlikely person to be doing this .PERIOD i never studied sculpture engineering or architecture .PERIOD it's a self-portrait titled wide hips ,COMMA returning to india to work with those fishermen .PERIOD we made a net of a million and a half hand-tied knots -- installed briefly in madrid ,COMMA my life was not going to be the same next challenge .PERIOD the biennial of the americas in denver asked ,COMMA could i represent the 35 nations of the western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture ?QUESTIONMARK i read about the recent earthquake in chile and the tsunami that rippled across the entire pacific ocean .PERIOD i started my journey 30 years ago ,COMMA and that also brought me to the fact that this poses such a risk to our society ,COMMA and together ,COMMA they only form about 15 years of supply .PERIOD but now we have a real technology to do this .PERIOD when they control their brain ,COMMA they can control their pain .PERIOD when you do ,COMMA what do you want to control ?QUESTIONMARK you will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself all your experiences .PERIOD these are some of the areas we're working on today that i don't have time to go into in detail .PERIOD but i want to leave with you the big question .PERIOD we are the first generation that's going to be able to enter into using this technology ,COMMA the human mind and brain what is worth dying for .PERIOD we know that it's possible to live in a failed state ,COMMA where everything that can go wrong .PERIOD does go wrong -- ,COMMA where mothers cannot feed their children ,COMMA where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration ,COMMA where people are murdered indiscriminately .PERIOD for instance ,COMMA there are 21 states in our country ,COMMA where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal ,COMMA where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board ,COMMA hard and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin .PERIOD but we can ask the obvious question :COLON is it a good idea generally speaking to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy ,COMMA emotional development and good behavior ?QUESTIONMARK now ,COMMA many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined and seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed .PERIOD when this statue was carved ,COMMA the average life expectancy was probably 30 does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition .PERIOD many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of no exceptions .PERIOD and yet chess is a domain of perfect objectivity .PERIOD but what does voluntary mean in a community where when a girl gets raped ,COMMA her father's first impulse ,COMMA rather often is to murder her out of shame just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute .PERIOD your daughter gets raped .PERIOD and what you want to do is kill her .PERIOD but if we are in a reflective mood ,COMMA we can ask is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies whenever we are talking about facts ,COMMA certain opinions must be excluded paint .PERIOD your picture of what rolling the clock 50 years forward ,COMMA 100 years forward ,COMMA how you would like to think of the world balancing moral progress with richness .PERIOD but again ,COMMA then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context ,COMMA sam .PERIOD this is a conversation .PERIOD i would actually love to continue for hours .PERIOD we don't have that ,COMMA but maybe another time .PERIOD thank you for coming to ted .PERIOD and then within zoology ,COMMA i took the course or the discipline of entomology ,COMMA the science of insects because biological control phenomenon .PERIOD you can see it in your backyard .PERIOD so this phenomenon of natural control exists literally everywhere .PERIOD so it's everywhere ,COMMA and we need to know how to exploit it ,COMMA what damage [does] .PERIOD it actually inflict on the plant insects .PERIOD those six-legged organisms and spiders or mites ,COMMA the eight-legged organisms on your right-hand side ,COMMA you can see a cucumber leaf and on the middle cotton leaf .PERIOD and on the left ,COMMA a tomato leaf with these little stipplings by the way it's springtime now in israel ,COMMA when temperature rises sharply ,COMMA you can see those bad ones .PERIOD those aphids all over the plants in your hibiscus in your lantana ,COMMA in the young fresh ,COMMA foliage of the spring flush so-called this is all natural .PERIOD this is all natural again .PERIOD we'll start first with the pest ,COMMA the thrips .PERIOD this is a sweet pepper ,COMMA which is not consumable because it is suffering from a viral disease transmitted by those thrip adults ,COMMA many different parts .PERIOD by the way they have a very nice landscape -- .PERIOD you see the jordanian mountains on the one hand and the jordan valley on the other hand and a good mild winter and a nice hot summer ,COMMA which is an excellent condition to mass-produce those creatures .PERIOD here we come with those natural enemies in order to reverse a little bit of the wheel and to bring more natural balance to the agricultural plot by reducing those chemicals in this table .PERIOD you can actually see what is an impact of a successful biological control by good bugs .PERIOD but if we go for example to this place ,COMMA southeast israel ,COMMA the arava area above the great rift valley ,COMMA where the really top-notch -- ,COMMA the pearl of the israeli agriculture is located ,COMMA especially under greenhouse conditions ,COMMA or under screenhouse conditions -- .PERIOD if you drive all the way to eilat ,COMMA you see this just in the middle of the desert step by step .PERIOD it does narrow .PERIOD so i'm saying it on behalf of all the biocontrol petitioners and implementers in israel and abroad ,COMMA really give nature a chance .PERIOD how can we understand ?QUESTIONMARK what makes some societies more fragile than other societies ?QUESTIONMARK the problem is obviously relevant to our situation today ,COMMA because today ,COMMA as well ,COMMA there are some societies that have already collapsed such as somalia and rwanda ,COMMA and the former yugoslavia there are also societies today that may be close to collapse ,COMMA such as nepal ,COMMA indonesia and columbia .PERIOD what is there that we can learn from the past that would help us avoid declining or collapsing in the way that so many past societies have ?QUESTIONMARK why did they all end up dead ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA in my five-point framework ?QUESTIONMARK the first item on the framework is to look for human impacts on the environment ,COMMA people inadvertently destroying the resource base on which they depend .PERIOD and in the case of the viking norse ,COMMA the vikings inadvertently caused soil ,COMMA erosion and deforestation ,COMMA which was a particular problem for them because they required forests to make charcoal to make iron .PERIOD or again ,COMMA the collapse of the soviet union took place within a couple of decades ,COMMA maybe within a decade of the time when the soviet union was at its greatest power .PERIOD so this is a frequent theme societies collapse ,COMMA very soon after reaching their peak in power .PERIOD and i would expect that if our human civilization carries on ,COMMA then maybe in the next century ,COMMA people will be asking why on earth did these people today in the year 2003 ,COMMA not see the obvious things that they were doing and take corrective action .PERIOD one blueprint for trouble making collapse likely is where there is a conflict of interest between the short-term interest of the decision-making elites and the long-term interest of the society as a whole ,COMMA especially if the elites are able to insulate themselves from the consequences of their actions where what's good in the short run for the elite is bad for the society as a whole .PERIOD there's a real risk of the elite doing things that would bring the society down in the long run .PERIOD so that's one general conclusion about why societies make bad decisions conflicts of interest .PERIOD instead ,COMMA all the major threats facing us today are problems entirely of our own making .PERIOD and since we made the problems ,COMMA we can also solve the problems that then means that it's entirely in our power to deal with these problems .PERIOD so i think i'm actually the first one here .PERIOD -- :COLON i lead .PERIOD and meanwhile ,COMMA i use nonsense as you can see .PERIOD this was one of a series called zany afternoons ,COMMA which became a book .PERIOD but the zeppelin was the biggest thing that ever moved made by man .PERIOD there's moscow shirley hope .PERIOD they speak esperanto .PERIOD those ,COMMA for example ,COMMA are mark iv ,COMMA british tanks from 1916 ,COMMA happy little story .PERIOD isn't it anybody ?QUESTIONMARK who was anybody had an apartment there ?QUESTIONMARK it's obviously modeled on the titanic .PERIOD i thought i could jazz it up a bit have a little fun with it .PERIOD this is the word side of my brain .PERIOD and then when it ran a lovely lady ,COMMA an old lady named mrs .PERIOD edgar rosenberg -- .PERIOD if you know that name -- called me and said ,COMMA she loved the cover .PERIOD it was so sweet ,COMMA pretty elegant ,COMMA nothing like a crash to end a joke that completes my oeuvre .PERIOD okay ,COMMA i'm going to show you again .PERIOD something about our diets .PERIOD there's six million species of insects on this planet ,COMMA six million species .PERIOD there was an estimation ,COMMA a conservative estimation ,COMMA a couple of years ago that the us economy benefited by 57 billion dollars per year .PERIOD small animals eat insects .PERIOD and here you see me enjoying a meal with caterpillars locusts bee ,COMMA pupae ,COMMA -- delicacies .PERIOD you're eating at least 500 grams per year .PERIOD we're even doing this on purpose .PERIOD now ,COMMA the situation in the world is going to change for you and me for everyone on this earth .PERIOD there was an fao conference last october that was completely devoted to this .PERIOD and we eat quite a lot of it in the developing world .PERIOD it's much lower .PERIOD so if you would be an entrepreneur ,COMMA what would you do ?QUESTIONMARK i gave you at least four arguments in favor .PERIOD there are entrepreneurs in the netherlands that produce them .PERIOD and one of them is here in the audience marian peeters ,COMMA who's in the picture .PERIOD well ,COMMA in the netherlands ,COMMA we have an innovative minister of agriculture .PERIOD and she puts the insects on the menu in her restaurant in her ministry ,COMMA reset the three minutes that's just not fair .PERIOD i would still be on my bad hip that was so disappointing .PERIOD great .PERIOD excellent .PERIOD so ,COMMA no ,COMMA suddenly i wasn't averse to butting any geezer off the list .PERIOD they were desperate for volunteers ,COMMA because the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was 75 .PERIOD so next thing ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i had my bright blue volunteer vest .PERIOD i had my photo id ,COMMA and i was fully trained by my 89-year-old boss .PERIOD i draped them casually over the chair in the doctor's office .PERIOD but i'd like to ask you ,COMMA how would you tell the time if you didn't have an iphone ?QUESTIONMARK you know ,COMMA i've always wanted one of these .PERIOD and this one ,COMMA this is a replica from a 15th-century device .PERIOD so tonight ,COMMA if it's clear ,COMMA you'll be able to see the summer triangle .PERIOD step three is identify the star on the front of the device .PERIOD he would know what time the sun would rise .PERIOD and what time it would set probably not one made of brass .PERIOD he would have one made out of wood or paper .PERIOD and the vast majority of this first computer was a portable device that you could keep in the back of your pocket .PERIOD so what does the astrolabe inspire ?QUESTIONMARK and what we gain with a new technology ?QUESTIONMARK of course ,COMMA is precision and accuracy .PERIOD i'm just going to show you how the robot works .PERIOD so even though there is nothing in nature that looks like this ,COMMA really ,COMMA we were inspired by biology and applying the principles of walking to this robot .PERIOD thus .PERIOD it's a biologically inspired robot .PERIOD we want to fold up the legs and shoot it up for long-range motion .PERIOD we developed our adaptive gait planner .PERIOD welcome to romela the robotics mechanisms laboratory at virginia tech .PERIOD this robot is an amoeba robot robotic air powered hand with elastic ligaments .PERIOD we wanted to go tackle this problem in a very different direction .PERIOD so for example ,COMMA in iraq ,COMMA you know the war zone there is roadside bombs .PERIOD currently you send these remotely controlled vehicles that are armed .PERIOD we actually have a fan club for the robot .PERIOD darwin dynamic anthropomorphic robot with intelligence .PERIOD so based on that success ,COMMA the following year ,COMMA we did the proper mechanical design ,COMMA starting from kinematics and thus darwin .PERIOD i was born in 2005 dennis hong .PERIOD so there is actually a competition called robocup .PERIOD we were the very first team in the united states that qualified in the humanoid robocup competition .PERIOD we truly believe this is going to be the very first running humanoid robot in the united states .PERIOD so stay tuned .PERIOD how do we develop these kinds of ideas ?QUESTIONMARK we have a fully autonomous vehicle that can drive into urban environments .PERIOD we won a half a million dollars in the darpa urban challenge .PERIOD we also have the world's very first vehicle that can be driven by the blind .PERIOD he gave a talk about how education and school kills creativity for us ,COMMA roboticists engineers and scientists ,COMMA these tools ,COMMA these are the courses and classes you take in class .PERIOD these are all the tools that we need .PERIOD bertie county is kind of a prime example in the demise of rural america .PERIOD there are more buildings that are empty or in disrepair than occupied .PERIOD and in use he was brought in in october 2007 as the new superintendent to basically fix this broken school system .PERIOD so in february of 2009 dr ,COMMA zullinger invited us project ,COMMA h design -- ,COMMA which is a non-profit design firm that i founded -- to come to bertie and to partner with him on the repair of this school district ,COMMA and to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district .PERIOD we now call this place home ,COMMA but beyond our personal reasons for wanting to be there .PERIOD there is a huge need .PERIOD it allows elementary-level students to learn core subjects through game ,COMMA play and activity and running around and screaming and being a kid .PERIOD so ,COMMA the first batch of computers are being installed later this summer ,COMMA and we're helping dr zullinger develop some strategies around how we might connect the classroom and the home to extend learning beyond the school day .PERIOD so we thought what if you could bring back shop class ,COMMA but this time ,COMMA orient ,COMMA the projects around things that the community needed and to infuse shop class with a more critical and creative-design-thinking studio process .PERIOD so over the course of two semesters ,COMMA the fall and the spring ,COMMA the students spend three hours a day every single day in our 4500 square foot studio/shop space .PERIOD so what studio h might offer her is a way to develop skills so that she might give back in the most meaningful way .PERIOD so for him studio ,COMMA h offers him a way to develop the skills .PERIOD he will need as an architect ,COMMA everything from drafting to wood and metal construction to how to do research for a client and going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors about what kind of food they buy and from where .PERIOD and why -- ?QUESTIONMARK that's a homework assignment .PERIOD because when you zoom out that far ,COMMA you lose the ability to view people as humans .PERIOD if you are a blind child in india ,COMMA you will very likely have to contend with at least two big pieces of bad news .PERIOD so i felt that i needed to do two things .PERIOD here's the eye with the opaque lens .PERIOD the opaque lens extracted and an acrylic lens inserted .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA the story holds true ,COMMA even if you have a person who got sight after several years of deprivation .PERIOD so the way we study that is ,COMMA let's say we find a child who has light sensitivity .PERIOD and we've used this general approach to study many different visual proficiencies .PERIOD but i want to highlight one particular one ,COMMA and that is image parsing into objects .PERIOD so any image of the kind that you see on the left ,COMMA be it a real image ,COMMA or a synthetic image .PERIOD it's made up of little regions that you see in the middle column regions of different colors ,COMMA different luminances .PERIOD and nobody knows how this integration happens .PERIOD and that's the question we asked with project prakash doctor ,COMMA what are their shapes doctor now ?QUESTIONMARK so we are creating dylan ,COMMA which is a computational system with an ambitious goal of taking in visual inputs of the same kind that a human child would receive and autonomously discovering what are the objects in this visual input .PERIOD here's what a baby-cam video looks like .PERIOD what's amazing is that working with such highly degraded input .PERIOD the baby very quickly is able to discover meaning in such input ,COMMA even before the ball gets to a place .PERIOD the child is already looking there .PERIOD so to summarize prakash in its five years of existence ,COMMA it's had an impact in multiple areas ranging from basic neuroscience ,COMMA plasticity and learning in the brain to clinically relevant hypotheses like in autism ,COMMA the development of autonomous machine ,COMMA vision systems education of the undergraduate and graduate students .PERIOD and most importantly ,COMMA in the alleviation of childhood ,COMMA blindness ,COMMA you know ,COMMA he's thinking ,COMMA what am i getting myself into ?QUESTIONMARK and he said ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA really you can and no disabled person had

didn't realize at that time that the amount of sweating i would be doing in the sock -- .PERIOD it actually acted like a lubricant ,COMMA and i'd be kind of pistoning in the socket .PERIOD he kept me on the right track .PERIOD everyone was taking pictures -- .PERIOD what is this girl running on ?QUESTIONMARK i'm sitting there like ,COMMA oh ,COMMA my god ,COMMA oh my god .PERIOD so they call us out .PERIOD and you know ,COMMA -- ,COMMA ladies ,COMMA you have one minute .PERIOD and i had to think why did i do this ?QUESTIONMARK you know ,COMMA show us more than one set of legs .PERIOD no ,COMMA these are my cosmetic legs ,COMMA actually ,COMMA and they're absolutely beautiful .PERIOD it has a shock absorber in it .PERIOD so it like shhhh makes this neat sound .PERIOD when you jump around on it all right in these for me ,COMMA while i'm such a serious athlete on the track ,COMMA i want to be feminine off the track .PERIOD and i think it's so important ,COMMA not to be limited in any capacity ,COMMA whether it's ,COMMA you know ,COMMA your mobility or even fashion .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA i love the fact that i can go in anywhere and pick out what i want -- the shoes .PERIOD i want the skirts .PERIOD i want -- ,COMMA and i'm hoping to try to bring these over here and make them accessible to a lot of people .PERIOD two weeks ago ,COMMA aimee was up for the arthur ashe award at the espys .PERIOD they didn't even want to touch that one .PERIOD they just did it .PERIOD what we're looking at here is the insidious cost of ringtone piracy .PERIOD but now you can find out all about -- .PERIOD unfortunately ,COMMA my weight is a little higher than that ,COMMA but -- all about what happens .PERIOD so i think ,COMMA in terms of the fact that math has been liberated from calculating .PERIOD it's the chore computers allow us to do that -- .PERIOD and this is not a small problem by any means .PERIOD that's an amazing amount of human endeavor .PERIOD and i'll say ,COMMA hmm ,COMMA not sure .PERIOD i'll think about it roughly .PERIOD well ,COMMA one of them is ,COMMA they say you need to get the basics first that somehow ,COMMA if you use a computer ,COMMA it's all mindless button-pushing .PERIOD but if you do it by hand ,COMMA it's all intellectual might have been 50 years ago ,COMMA but it isn't anymore .PERIOD why are we using computers to show a student ,COMMA how to solve a problem by hand that the computer should be doing anyway ?QUESTIONMARK same principles ,COMMA applied ,COMMA -- calculations ,COMMA harder .PERIOD so the problem we've really got in math education is not that computers might dumb it down ,COMMA but that we have dumbed-down problems right now .PERIOD so if you go through lots of examples ,COMMA you can get the answer .PERIOD you can understand how the basics of the system work better .PERIOD so programming is the way .PERIOD i think we should be doing that .PERIOD this was an example .PERIOD i built for my daughter .PERIOD you can see that this is a very early step into limits and differential calculus .PERIOD and what happens when you take things to an extreme -- and very small sides ,COMMA and a very large number of sides ?QUESTIONMARK and yet ,COMMA that's a really important practical view of the world .PERIOD it's like the land and the king they're inseparable .PERIOD they are one .PERIOD the contract is the same as with real word objects in real world containers and finally to pull out all the stops .PERIOD this is a system called urp for urban planners in which we give architects and urban planners back the models that we confiscated ,COMMA when we insisted that they use cad systems .PERIOD it projects down digital shadows as you see here .PERIOD there are inter-shadowing studies that children can operate .PERIOD even though they don't know anything about urban planning to move a building .PERIOD you simply reach out your hand ,COMMA and you move the building .PERIOD this work is 15 years old .PERIOD and the great thing about it was that alex was so dedicated to the idea of verisimilitude ,COMMA the idea that the putative 2054 that we were painting in the film ,COMMA be believable that he allowed us to take on that design work as if it were an r&ampd effort .PERIOD and the result is sort of gratifyingly perpetual people still reference those sequences in minority report ,COMMA when they talk about new ui design .PERIOD these are logistics elements that are scattered across the united states .PERIOD this is a system called tamper ,COMMA which is a slightly whimsical .PERIOD look at what the future of editing and media manipulation systems might be .PERIOD we'll go over to jacques tati here and grab our blue friend ,COMMA and put him down on the table as well .PERIOD let me leave with one final thought .PERIOD and that is that one of the greatest english language writers of the last three decades suggested that great art is always a gift .PERIOD can it be for every man ?QUESTIONMARK or is this just for corporations and movie producers ?QUESTIONMARK that's our goal entirely .PERIOD so this is the inevitability about it .PERIOD i just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig .PERIOD it was a wonderful experience .PERIOD you can just google it .PERIOD as i say ,COMMA in my book ,COMMA i'm jewish in the same way .PERIOD the olive garden is italian .PERIOD the first thing i did was i got a stack of bibles .PERIOD i had christian bibles .PERIOD so i wanted to follow that rule .PERIOD and there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging ,COMMA but it's a big part of the bible .PERIOD so i figured i had to address it .PERIOD i wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind .PERIOD and i explained my project ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA well ,COMMA i am an adulterer .PERIOD are you going to stone me ?QUESTIONMARK they really did a fantastic job .PERIOD i wanted it to be about religion in america .PERIOD so this was very inspiring to me .PERIOD i recommend jim wallis and tony campolo .PERIOD they're very inspiring leaders ,COMMA even though i disagree with much of what they say and i would say ,COMMA but that's crazy .PERIOD the key is to pick and choose the right parts .PERIOD there's the phrase called cafeteria ,COMMA religion ,COMMA and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way .PERIOD and they'll say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA it's just cafeteria religion ,COMMA you're just picking and choosing the story starts in kenya ,COMMA in december of 2007 ,COMMA when there was a disputed presidential election ,COMMA and in the immediate aftermath of that election ,COMMA there was an outbreak of ethnic violence .PERIOD and she quickly said it's too much .PERIOD and enough people looked at it and found it valuable enough that the programmers who created ushahidi decided they were going to make it open source and turn it into a platform .PERIOD and it represents the ability of the world's population to volunteer and to contribute and collaborate on large ,COMMA sometimes global projects .PERIOD and once they've done it ,COMMA they can do it again .PERIOD and they could work on getting it better .PERIOD even with the sacred printing press ,COMMA we got erotic novels 150 years before we got scientific journals .PERIOD so before i talk about ,COMMA what is i think the critical difference between lolcats and ushahidi ,COMMA i want to talk about their shared source at pick-up time .PERIOD the teachers who have been with your children all day would like you to be there at the appointed hour to take your children back late pick-ups ,COMMA went up every week for the next four weeks ,COMMA until they topped out at triple the pre-fine average .PERIOD and then they fluctuated at between double and triple ,COMMA the pre-fine average for the life of the fine .PERIOD they were operating with social constraints ,COMMA rather than contractual ones .PERIOD it's value created by the participants ,COMMA but enjoyed by society as a whole .PERIOD the goals set out by ushahidi are not just to make life better for the participants ,COMMA but to make life better for everyone in the society in which ushahidi is operating ,COMMA we've got a choice before us ,COMMA and may it run forever because it gives people like me a living .PERIOD there were two sundays in between .PERIOD but of course ,COMMA sundays are church days .PERIOD so you don't play on sundays and one day it rained .PERIOD so they all sat around making friends with each other .PERIOD and then you worked out your strategy ,COMMA and you came and fought the next day ,COMMA and you went back home again .PERIOD take a look .PERIOD you could play it in the dump with some rocks over there .PERIOD you could play it in a little alley -- .PERIOD you couldn't hit square anywhere ,COMMA because the bat hit the wall .PERIOD don't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires as you can see ,COMMA you can play anywhere .PERIOD and we won this world cup in 1983 .PERIOD and so we allowed multinationals into india .PERIOD we cut customs duties .PERIOD we reduced import duties .PERIOD and we got all the multinationals coming in with multinational budgets who looked at per-capita income and got very excited about the possibilities in india and were looking for a vehicle to reach every indian .PERIOD but what a game we had m s dhoni ,COMMA got it right in the air ,COMMA but misbah-ul-haq ,COMMA what a player ,COMMA a massive ,COMMA massive success ,COMMA india ,COMMA the world tt champions .PERIOD so it was a different india .PERIOD now ,COMMA all of the sudden ,COMMA if you were to bowl a shot -- ,COMMA if mumbai were to bowl a shot ,COMMA for example ,COMMA they needn't go to kalbadevi or shivaji park or somewhere to source them .PERIOD they could go to trinidad .PERIOD so he played in hyderabad ,COMMA went straight .PERIOD after the game went from the stadium to hyderabad airport ,COMMA sat in a private corporate jet ,COMMA -- first refueling in portugal .PERIOD second refueling in brazil ,COMMA he was in west indies in time .PERIOD they started going to the cricket to watch shah .PERIOD rukh khan for a long time .PERIOD india was this country of poverty dust ,COMMA beggars snake ,COMMA charmers ,COMMA filth ,COMMA delhi ,COMMA belly -- ,COMMA people heard delhi belly stories before they came .PERIOD hopefully ,COMMA it'll make everyone richer .PERIOD hopefully ,COMMA it'll make the game bigger .PERIOD and hopefully ,COMMA it'll give cricket commentators more time in the business .PERIOD we all make decisions every day .PERIOD we want to know what the right thing is to do -- in domains ,COMMA from the financial to the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic .PERIOD and surely ,COMMA if somebody could really tell us how to do exactly the right thing at all possible times that would be a tremendous gift .PERIOD this is what statisticians technically call a damn fine .PERIOD bet calculating odds would seem to be something rather easy .PERIOD there are six sides to a die .PERIOD two sides to a coin 52 cards in a deck .PERIOD it's because the mind recalls words by their first letter .PERIOD why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA there are many answers .PERIOD but one answer ,COMMA surely ,COMMA is we see a lot of winners right when this couple wins ,COMMA the lottery or ed mcmahon shows up at your door with this giant check -- .PERIOD how the hell do you cash things that size ?QUESTIONMARK i don't know when was the last time that you saw extensive interviews with everybody who lost .PERIOD you can't say to yourself .PERIOD i'm as likely to win as anybody because you're not as likely to win as leroy ,COMMA because they had the sense that declining wages are worse than rising wages .PERIOD even when the total amount of wages is higher in the declining period .PERIOD here's another nice example .PERIOD here's a $2000 hawaiian vacation package .PERIOD it's now on sale for 1600 .PERIOD this tendency to compare to the past is causing people to pass up the better deal .PERIOD in other words ,COMMA a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal .PERIOD now ,COMMA just in case you're not getting it .PERIOD here's a schematic of what happened .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK the difference is that when you lost the ticket ,COMMA you say to yourself ,COMMA i'm not paying twice for the same thing .PERIOD nonetheless ,COMMA their predictions are perverted by a comparison that then does not carry through and change their experience .PERIOD when you go to buy groceries with it ,COMMA it doesn't go .PERIOD i'm the money saved on the car stereo ,COMMA or i'm the dumb money saved on the car .PERIOD it's money .PERIOD and if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks ,COMMA it's worth 100 bucks ,COMMA no matter what you're saving it on .PERIOD people don't think that way .PERIOD well ,COMMA by and large ,COMMA people are enormously impatient .PERIOD imagine that you can have 50 dollars in a year -- .PERIOD that's 12 months ,COMMA -- or 60 dollars in 13 months .PERIOD this is just a graph showing the results that i just suggested you would show if i gave you time to respond ,COMMA which is people find that the subjective value of 50 is higher than the subjective value of 60 when they'll be delivered in now ,COMMA or one month ,COMMA respectively -- ,COMMA a 30-day delay -- .PERIOD but they show the reverse pattern .PERIOD when you push the entire decision off into the future ,COMMA a year .PERIOD what causes the bug is it ?QUESTIONMARK the drama of the event -- that it's so spectacular ?QUESTIONMARK i don't want to say ,COMMA -- ,COMMA please .PERIOD i'm going to get quoted somewhere as saying ,COMMA terrorism is fine .PERIOD and we shouldn't be so distressed .PERIOD what i'm saying is that surely rationally our distress about things that happen about threats should be roughly proportional to the size of those threats and threats to come .PERIOD there's no question .PERIOD and so we evolved these responses .PERIOD it turns out that the value of buying a lottery ticket is not winning .PERIOD that's what you think it is all right .PERIOD and as a result ,COMMA many people look at economists as stupid people .PERIOD it's the sequel to an inconvenient truth .PERIOD and it explores all the solutions that will solve the climate crisis ,COMMA or we can scroll through the pages at the bottom ,COMMA mike matas .PERIOD and so throughout the whole book ,COMMA al gore will walk you through and explain the photos .PERIOD this photo ,COMMA you can you can even see on an interactive map .PERIOD and while it's playing ,COMMA we can pinch and peak back at the page .PERIOD and the movie keeps playing .PERIOD this is very strange for me because i’m not used to doing this .PERIOD i usually stand on the other side of the light .PERIOD and now i'm feeling the pressure .PERIOD i put other people into and it's hard .PERIOD so we’ll go with the first piece court .PERIOD i don't want to get rid of you .PERIOD boy ,COMMA look man :COLON reading .PERIOD don't feed .PERIOD no one boy ,COMMA arguing with .PERIOD you is a waste of time marcus marcus .PERIOD when a man resorts to profanities it’s ,COMMA a sure sign of his inability to express himself .PERIOD did you ever move your fuckin' ass from hollywood to go and film ?QUESTIONMARK something real ?QUESTIONMARK the first piece was really ,COMMA there's a young woman talking about nigeria that she has a feeling .PERIOD she'll be happy there .PERIOD so that whole thing that whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece ,COMMA commander soldiers ,COMMA you are going to fight a battle .PERIOD so you must get ready and willing to die .PERIOD c success .PERIOD the change is only coming through the barrel of the gun .PERIOD i don’t remember how we got there .PERIOD the injection made us not to have mind various voices .PERIOD you will die .PERIOD you will die .PERIOD onicha ezra .PERIOD why you giving these to me mr .PERIOD ezra gelehun .PERIOD please stand ,COMMA no .PERIOD we don’t mr gelehun .PERIOD i'd like to remind you .PERIOD you're not on trial here today .PERIOD you are not on trial .PERIOD e :COLON so you are a liar .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD in the process of my research .PERIOD i actually spent a bit of time in sierra leone researching this .PERIOD i met psychosocial workers who worked with them .PERIOD frank gehry :COLON i listened to this scientist this morning .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA it is astonishing for an artist for an architect to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time .PERIOD and i realized when i'd come into the meetings with these corrugated metal and chain ,COMMA link stuff .PERIOD and people would just look at me like i'd just landed from mars .PERIOD and like the playwright said ,COMMA the other day -- i could relate to him .PERIOD you're not sure .PERIOD yeah ,COMMA there aren't many people around that are really involved with architecture as clients .PERIOD if you think about the world ,COMMA and even just in this audience ,COMMA most of us are involved with buildings .PERIOD i knew craig and respected him .PERIOD i knew you'd ask that question .PERIOD i tried to understand that language as a beginning as a place to jump off .PERIOD and there was so much of it being done by spec builders .PERIOD and it was trivialized so much that it wasn't siza .PERIOD on the other hand ,COMMA continued in portugal ,COMMA where the real stuff was and evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language .PERIOD i tried to get him a couple of jobs ,COMMA and they didn't pan out where you .PERIOD it's like jazz .PERIOD you improvise you work together .PERIOD you play off each other .PERIOD you make something they make something .PERIOD richard koshalek [unclear] starts from 2004 .PERIOD you can come to the opening .PERIOD i'll invite you .PERIOD i'd seen drawings .PERIOD you had presented here at ted .PERIOD they came for three days .PERIOD you've all heard the frank lloyd wright story when the woman called and said ,COMMA mr wright ,COMMA i'm sitting on the couch .PERIOD and the water's pouring in on my head .PERIOD rsw didn't get a laugh .PERIOD what do you bring to it ?QUESTIONMARK that's what reminded me of it .PERIOD just before going to lunch with the mayor ,COMMA we went to the harbor commissioner .PERIOD we sat down ,COMMA and we had a drink of water ,COMMA and everybody was quiet .PERIOD so i got up .PERIOD they just brought us there to hustle this group ,COMMA you know ,COMMA to create a project ,COMMA because i want to get a standing ovation like everybody .PERIOD so ,COMMA but reliable ,COMMA dutchman ,COMMA -- ,COMMA -- ,COMMA fantastic .PERIOD and this was the text -- in words as fashion .PERIOD the same rule will hold/ alike fantastic if too new or old/ ,COMMA be not the first by whom the new are tried/ ,COMMA nor yet ,COMMA the last to lay the old aside .PERIOD so it was going nowhere .PERIOD that's what happens silas usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations .PERIOD don't be trendy if you want to be serious .PERIOD but we don't have time .PERIOD there were 10 artists invited to participate in it .PERIOD and it was one of those things where it was extremely competitive ,COMMA and i didn't want to be embarrassed .PERIOD so i worked very hard on this ,COMMA but i was absolutely stuck on the idea of art is and trying to determine what art was .PERIOD we've watched the financial markets that we uniquely create -- these markets that were supposed to be foolproof -- .PERIOD we've watched them kind of collapse before our eyes .PERIOD and of course ,COMMA if we are put in environments where we can't deal with it ,COMMA in some sense ,COMMA makes sense that we actually might mess certain things up .PERIOD it feels like we might almost just be built to make errors in certain ways .PERIOD so this is the question ,COMMA my students ,COMMA and i wanted to get at what if we put holly into the same context as humans because ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's great for us ,COMMA but bad for humans .PERIOD they were these kind of weird things .PERIOD so the monkeys get really good at this .PERIOD the monkeys would rip-off the tokens at every available opportunity ,COMMA -- from each other often from us -- ,COMMA you know things we didn't necessarily think we were introducing but things we spontaneously saw .PERIOD we were a little impatient .PERIOD so we wanted to sort of speed things up a bit sounds great ,COMMA but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money .PERIOD your other option is a bit safe ,COMMA your just going to get some money for sure .PERIOD so see what your intuition is here .PERIOD most people say ,COMMA why should i be risky when i can get 1500 dollars for sure ?QUESTIONMARK and now imagine that i have you make another choice .PERIOD but this time it's a little bit worse .PERIOD they actually tend to go a little risky .PERIOD and this means that sometimes we'll actually switch our preferences to avoid this .PERIOD what you saw in that last scenario is that subjects get risky ,COMMA because they want the small shot that there won't be any loss .PERIOD they're why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer -- because they're evaluating them in relative terms .PERIOD the question we were interested in is whether the monkeys show the same biases ,COMMA sometimes the monkeys get no bonus -- .PERIOD so this is a bonus of zero now ,COMMA the monkeys meet two guys ,COMMA who aren't giving them bonuses .PERIOD they're actually giving them less than they expect .PERIOD so you know ,COMMA a little bad -- .PERIOD sorry ,COMMA sorry ,COMMA sorry .PERIOD when you're watching your stocks plummet into the red ,COMMA when you're watching your house price ,COMMA go down ,COMMA you're not going to be able to see that in anything ,COMMA but old evolutionary terms .PERIOD but we have to recognize that we have those limitations .PERIOD we have this great north .PERIOD and there was a pretty small population .PERIOD and my father was an avid outdoorsman .PERIOD but what i think it was telling me is that we are this transient thing that's happening .PERIOD and that the nature that you see out there -- ,COMMA the untouched shorelines .PERIOD the untouched forest that i was able to see -- ,COMMA really bring in a sense of that geological time that this has gone on for a long time .PERIOD and we're experiencing it in a different way ,COMMA this rebirth of grass .PERIOD and then i went out for years ,COMMA trying to photograph the pristine landscape .PERIOD so there's this thing that is pulling me in both directions ,COMMA but we've become totally disconnected from them that if we keep putting things through industrial and urban existence back into the system -- ,COMMA if we keep doing that -- ,COMMA we can continue on ,COMMA because i think everything that we're involved in -- ,COMMA our clothing ,COMMA our cars ,COMMA our roads and everything -- are directly .PERIOD a result .PERIOD i'm going to move to some pictures of china .PERIOD so this created a reservoir 600 kilometers long ,COMMA one of the largest reservoirs ever created .PERIOD and again ,COMMA the rebuilding of the city -- to me .PERIOD it was sad to see that they didn't really grab a lot of .PERIOD i guess what we know here in terms of urban planning .PERIOD this is a shot in one of the biggest squares in guangdong -- .PERIOD and this is where a lot of migrant workers are coming in from the country .PERIOD so this is a pink uniform at this factory .PERIOD it's a shoe factory ,COMMA and they have dorms for the workers .PERIOD this is one with 45000 .PERIOD so every lunch there's about 12000 coming through for lunch .PERIOD they sit down .PERIOD they have about 20 minutes .PERIOD they're not getting enough .PERIOD so they're not going to move .PERIOD shanghai was a very intriguing city -- .PERIOD it's exploding on a level that i don't think any city has experienced .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA even shenzhen the economic zone -- .PERIOD one of the first ones ,COMMA -- 15 years ago ,COMMA was about 100000 people .PERIOD and today ,COMMA it boasts about 10 to 11 million .PERIOD so this is three of the visible blast furnaces within that shot .PERIOD i think one of the issues that we here are facing with china is that they're using a lot of the latest production technology .PERIOD but that is the trick that they've got right now that they're winning with is that they're using all the latest technologies and extrusion machines ,COMMA and bringing all the components into play .PERIOD but the assembly is where they're actually bringing in -- .PERIOD the country workers are very willing to work .PERIOD they want to work .PERIOD i had to have them freeze for 10 seconds to get this shot .PERIOD there are 500 of these machines .PERIOD they're worth about 200000 dollars each .PERIOD so you have about 12 people running this ,COMMA and they're just inspecting it -- ,COMMA and they're just walking the lines .PERIOD this was one of the biggest factories i've ever seen .PERIOD but this is what happens to most of the computers .PERIOD and as much as there are great things around the corner -- ,COMMA and it's palpable in this room ,COMMA -- of all of the things that are just about to break that can solve so many problems .PERIOD i'm really hoping that those things will spread around the world and will start to have a positive effect .PERIOD some of you might know he's a tedster ,COMMA -- ,COMMA stephen sagmeister .PERIOD and i are working on some layouts .PERIOD and this is still in preliminary stages .PERIOD these aren't the finals .PERIOD but these images with worldchangingcom can be placed into any kind of media .PERIOD so we're looking at this as trying to build out and anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic that would be fantastic .PERIOD so those are my three wishes .PERIOD and i'd like to start at the very beginning ,COMMA the more stuff that's mine the better .PERIOD and of course ,COMMA it's your stuff if it's broken ,COMMA and they extract the metals by hand .PERIOD so about 20 years ago ,COMMA i literally started in my garage ,COMMA tinkering around ,COMMA trying to figure out how to separate these very similar materials from each other .PERIOD and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends in the mining world ,COMMA actually and in the plastics world .PERIOD and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world .PERIOD and instead of plopping down ,COMMA several hundred million dollars to build a chemical plant ,COMMA that will only make one type of plastic for its entire life .PERIOD our plants can make any type of plastic .PERIOD we feed them .PERIOD we use a very highly automated process to sort those plastics ,COMMA not only by type ,COMMA but by grade .PERIOD so i hope i've changed the way you look at at least some of the stuff in your life .PERIOD mother :COLON nature wastes very little reuses ,COMMA practically everything .PERIOD and i hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer -- .PERIOD that's a label .PERIOD i've always hated my entire life -- and think of yourself as just using resources in one form until they can be transformed to another form for another use later in time .PERIOD now ,COMMA it was not always wonderful at that table .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA you could come down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing and then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed ,COMMA except that daddy ,COMMA messed it up now .PERIOD that's compassion .PERIOD so let me tell you ,COMMA i kind of look at the world this way i see -- ,COMMA always it stirs .PERIOD my heart -- ,COMMA a picture of dr ,COMMA martin luther king jr .PERIOD this is the picture .PERIOD they said ,COMMA it's going to be too volatile for you to go .PERIOD we are so connected that we must treat each other .PERIOD as if an action toward you is an action toward myself ,COMMA and whatever else is needed .PERIOD i will provide it and pay for it .PERIOD when i return .PERIOD this always seemed to me to be a deepening of the sense of what it means to be a good samaritan .PERIOD but now to be a good samaritan -- .PERIOD and i always say ,COMMA and to be a good american -- for me ,COMMA is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care .PERIOD and if mama eternal has taught us correctly ,COMMA this song will make sense not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering ,COMMA but to all who sign the charter for compassion .PERIOD i just want to say ,COMMA my name is emmanuel jal and also telling it like now .PERIOD and also the easiest .PERIOD one was when i was doing it in form of a music .PERIOD i wanted to revenge for my village .PERIOD my every moment run duck ,COMMA play ,COMMA dead and hide .PERIOD but still ,COMMA as i wonder ,COMMA i won't go under .PERIOD i was ready to eat .PERIOD give us tools ,COMMA give the farmers tools .PERIOD and now we have a couple in university ♫ what would i be ♫ ♫ if emma never rescued me ♫ ♫ what would i be ♫ ♫ another starving refugee ?QUESTIONMARK ♫ ♫ what would i be ♫ ♫ if emma never rescued me ♫ ♫ yeah ,COMMA yeah .PERIOD ♫ ♫ yeah ,COMMA i would have probably died from starvation ♫ ♫ or some other wretched disease .PERIOD ♫ ♫ i would have grown up with no education .PERIOD ♫ ♫ just another refugee .PERIOD ♫ thank you .PERIOD we've used fear if you like to grab people's attention ,COMMA a deer ,COMMA freezes ,COMMA very ,COMMA very still poised to run away .PERIOD and i think that's what we're doing when we're asking people to engage with our agenda around environmental degradation and climate change .PERIOD and unsurprisingly ,COMMA people all around the world say that what they want is happiness for themselves for their families ,COMMA their children ,COMMA their communities .PERIOD okay ,COMMA they think money is slightly important .PERIOD it thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck .PERIOD they are doing that on a quarter of the resources that are used typically in [the] western world ,COMMA -- a quarter of the resources ,COMMA what's happening in ,COMMA costa rica .PERIOD 99 percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources .PERIOD and so in strict happy-planet methodology ,COMMA we've become less efficient at turning our ultimate scarce resource into the outcome .PERIOD we want to a child entering school today will be my age in 2050 .PERIOD and i put it to you that is not business as usual .PERIOD i think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing .PERIOD and the point of these is they are not quite the secrets of happiness ,COMMA but they are things that i think happiness will flow out the side from keep building them .PERIOD the second one is be active based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness cognitive ,COMMA behavioral therapy ,COMMA [very] strong for our well being .PERIOD they don't need a lot of material goods to be satisfied ,COMMA all that being good and no real credit for it .PERIOD so i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA mom and dad ,COMMA what about santa claus santa would come to our house while we were at nine o'clock high mass on christmas morning .PERIOD but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss .PERIOD there's only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence .PERIOD our family was too strange and weird for even santa claus to come visit .PERIOD and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment ,COMMA this humiliation of rejection by santa who was jolly -- ,COMMA but let's face it .PERIOD he was also very judgmental .PERIOD they had to fit two criteria .PERIOD they had to be old enough to be able to understand the whole concept of the age of reason ,COMMA and not yet seven .PERIOD i just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven ,COMMA and then you're capable of committing any and all sins against god and man .PERIOD and bill said ,COMMA so ,COMMA and then i said ,COMMA so you're six .PERIOD you have a whole year to do anything you want to .PERIOD and god won't notice it .PERIOD and he said ,COMMA so ,COMMA and i said ,COMMA so so everything and i turned to run .PERIOD i was so angry with him .PERIOD and she said ,COMMA listen ,COMMA the cut-off date to start kindergarten was september 15 .PERIOD so i took the bus downtown to get the new libra poster .PERIOD now ,COMMA i was raised in the pacific northwest around a lot of church of latter-day ,COMMA saints people .PERIOD and you know ,COMMA i've worked with them and even dated them .PERIOD but i never really knew the doctrine ,COMMA or what they said to people when they were out on a mission .PERIOD and i guess i was sort of curious .PERIOD so i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA please come in ,COMMA and they looked really happy ,COMMA because i don't think this happens to them .PERIOD all that often and i sat them down ,COMMA and i got them glasses of water -- .PERIOD ok ,COMMA i got it .PERIOD i got them glasses of water .PERIOD and they told me this story .PERIOD all about this guy named lehi who lived in jerusalem in 600 bc .PERIOD i wanted to say ,COMMA ok ,COMMA don't start with this story .PERIOD i said ,COMMA oh come on .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA even if women tried to have a baby ,COMMA every single year from the time ,COMMA they were 15 to the time .PERIOD they were 45 ,COMMA assuming they didn't die from exhaustion .PERIOD it still seems like some women would have some time left over to hear the word of god .PERIOD and they said ,COMMA no ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA oh ,COMMA -- ,COMMA hey ,COMMA well ,COMMA we also believe that when you go to heaven ,COMMA you get your body restored to you in its best original state ,COMMA or if you'd gone blind ,COMMA you could see if someone came to my door .PERIOD and i was hearing catholic theology and dogma for the very first time .PERIOD and they said ,COMMA we believe that god impregnated a very young girl without the use of intercourse .PERIOD and the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us .PERIOD -- -- ,COMMA and she had a baby .PERIOD and that's the son of god .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA i would think that's equally ridiculous .PERIOD yes ,COMMA breast cancer ,COMMA overcome with the enormity of it ,COMMA all and the complete feeling of loss of control .PERIOD i shed copious tears and asked my dear husband jayant .PERIOD i danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule .PERIOD it's the power of bringing ourselves to the attention of something that so animates you .PERIOD so moves you that something even like cancer becomes insignificant .PERIOD it's the power of an image .PERIOD nobody really did anything with it pretty much .PERIOD they brought all sorts of different computers with them .PERIOD so that in all that diversity ,COMMA if i wanted to figure out how to build something out of a bit of this and a bit of this everything i looked into ,COMMA i had to connect to some new machine .PERIOD i had to learn to run some new program .PERIOD i would find the information i wanted in some new data format .PERIOD and that is what has made it most fun .PERIOD they're much more than we'd originally imagined .PERIOD when we put together the little initial website that we started off with one of the great -- ,COMMA yes ,COMMA a lot of people have seen it -- .PERIOD one of the great ted talks hans ,COMMA put up this presentation in which he showed for various different countries in various different colors ,COMMA -- .PERIOD he showed income levels on one axis ,COMMA and he showed infant mortality .PERIOD and he shot this thing animated through time .PERIOD so he'd taken this data and made a presentation ,COMMA which just shattered a lot of myths that people had about the economics in the developing world .PERIOD it had underground all the data .PERIOD ok ,COMMA data is brown and boxy and boring .PERIOD and that's how we think of it .PERIOD isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK in this case ,COMMA hans had put the data together .PERIOD he had found from all kinds of united nations ,COMMA websites and things .PERIOD we're using them for people .PERIOD we're using them for places .PERIOD we're using them for your products .PERIOD we're using them for events .PERIOD i wrote an article entitled linked data a couple of years ago .PERIOD and soon after that ,COMMA things started to happen .PERIOD ok ,COMMA we have to ask for raw data now practice that it's important because you have no idea .PERIOD the number of excuses .PERIOD people come up with to hang onto their data and not give it to you ,COMMA even though you've paid for it as a taxpayer .PERIOD the people who are going to solve those -- .PERIOD the scientists -- ,COMMA they have half-formed ideas in their head .PERIOD they try to communicate those over the web .PERIOD and that is what linked data is all about .PERIOD you get this really huge power out of it .PERIOD then i realized that what i was getting from ,COMMA giving was a narcissistic hit -- that i felt good about myself right now ,COMMA as bill mcdonough has pointed out ,COMMA the objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences .PERIOD and i spent a couple of weeks going around with a social work agency that ministered to the homeless .PERIOD and i realized seeing the homeless through their eyes that almost all of them were psychiatric patients that had nowhere to go .PERIOD they had a diagnosis .PERIOD it made me -- .PERIOD what it did was to shake me out of the urban trance ,COMMA where when we see when we're passing someone who's homeless in the periphery of our vision ,COMMA it stays on the periphery one day .PERIOD soon after that -- ,COMMA it was a friday -- at the end of the day .PERIOD i went down -- .PERIOD i was going down to the subway .PERIOD it was rush hour ,COMMA and thousands of people were streaming down the stairs .PERIOD and anyway ,COMMA the next morning we had to go along to the jeweler and get it cut off .PERIOD and then yes ,COMMA all these other ones as well .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA how do you do this ?QUESTIONMARK so i suppose you're not going to be able to kick me off the stage since you asked the question .PERIOD so just help us with some of the numbers .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA how big is the group overall ?QUESTIONMARK no ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA i think -- ca ,COMMA but is that your hair ?QUESTIONMARK ok ,COMMA of course ,COMMA yeah .PERIOD well ,COMMA 25 years earlier ,COMMA we'd launched the sex pistols' .PERIOD god ,COMMA save the queen .PERIOD and i'd certainly never expected that 25 years later ,COMMA -- that she'd actually knight us .PERIOD well ,COMMA i got pulled out of the sea .PERIOD i think six times by helicopters so -- and each time i didn't expect to come home to tell the tale ,COMMA but the ends of all those balloon trips were ,COMMA you know ,COMMA -- something seemed to go wrong every time .PERIOD and on that particular occasion ,COMMA the more experienced balloonist ,COMMA who was with me jumped and left me holding on for dear life .PERIOD yeah ,COMMA no ,COMMA i put on my oxygen mask ,COMMA and stood on top of the balloon with my parachute ,COMMA looking at the swirling clouds below trying to pluck up my courage to jump into the north sea ,COMMA which -- .PERIOD and it was a very ,COMMA very ,COMMA very lonely few moments ,COMMA the years -- .PERIOD and until i stopped looking at the polls ,COMMA you were sort of regarded as this great hero in the uk and elsewhere .PERIOD ok ,COMMA this isn't exactly hardball .PERIOD ok .PERIOD didn't -- weren't you just terrible at school ?QUESTIONMARK and generally the people would say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA well ,COMMA that's bad news .PERIOD did this really happen and making us go on wonderful long bike rides .PERIOD but is there a risk here ?QUESTIONMARK i was actually prosecuted under two quite ancient acts in the uk .PERIOD we changed it to social diseases .PERIOD and people came along with acne and spots ,COMMA but nobody came with vd any more and john mortimer ,COMMA the playwright ,COMMA defended us .PERIOD so seriously ,COMMA is there a dark side ?QUESTIONMARK there was a nasty biography written about you by someone .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA do you think about life balance ?QUESTIONMARK but the problem with capitalism is extreme wealth ends up in the hands of a few people and therefore extreme responsibility .PERIOD i think goes with that wealth .PERIOD and is there a risk that the kind of the business heroes of the west get so excited about -- ?QUESTIONMARK i mean ,COMMA they're used to having an idea getting stuff done ,COMMA and they believe profoundly in their ability to make a difference in the world .PERIOD but i think business leaders can bring their entrepreneurial know-how and help governments approach things slightly differently .PERIOD well ,COMMA richard when i was starting off in business ,COMMA i knew nothing about it .PERIOD and i also was sort of -- .PERIOD i thought that business people were supposed to just be ruthless ,COMMA and that that was the only way you could have a chance of succeeding .PERIOD so i would like to thank you for that inspiration .PERIOD and for coming to ted today .PERIOD thank you ,COMMA i would say ,COMMA with a great smile ,COMMA i will definitely pass .PERIOD he just started asking ,COMMA where did you buy the radio ?QUESTIONMARK how much is it ?QUESTIONMARK and he said ,COMMA oh ,COMMA i teach at a college of arts .PERIOD it can be ruins ,COMMA or it can be music ,COMMA or it can be painting or drawing or writing whatever it is .PERIOD but it is just a kind of trace of that time .PERIOD so it took about 24 hours to get this line .PERIOD so what we see is just what we think often .PERIOD and most of the time we don't see what it is .PERIOD so this work from this period is mostly like -- .PERIOD you know ,COMMA this is a work called light makes dark .PERIOD this is an exact negative .PERIOD but a solution arrived after being quiet and not working for about six seven months in the restroom ,COMMA when i was changing the air freshener that goes from solid substance to vapor .PERIOD this is the work i made out of that material .PERIOD so i told them i'd like to start an air freshener company .PERIOD so i just started doing this work to inquire further about how to sculpt the space between this object and there ,COMMA because as a visual artist ,COMMA if i'm seeing this ,COMMA and i'm seeing that -- ,COMMA but how to sculpt this ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's the same in marketing .PERIOD it only took one robust observation from copernicus to blow that idea out of the water .PERIOD take bp -- .PERIOD they spent millions of pounds over many years building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand ,COMMA but then one little accident .PERIOD the same is true of marketing .PERIOD it makes this distribution of energy ,COMMA a democratizing force ,COMMA which is ultimately good for your brand .PERIOD i see you're all up on the history of hurdy-gurdy -- ,COMMA vielle ,COMMA à roue .PERIOD it's also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique .PERIOD and today ,COMMA the hurdy-gurdy is used in all sorts of music ,COMMA -- traditional folk music dance ,COMMA contemporary and world music -- in the uk in france ,COMMA in spain and in italy .PERIOD but the moment you fall in love ,COMMA you become extremely sexually possessive of them .PERIOD but the main characteristics of romantic love are craving ,COMMA an intense craving to be with a particular person .PERIOD not just sexually ,COMMA but emotionally .PERIOD and then the very last question ,COMMA i would ask them -- .PERIOD i would always have to work myself up to this question because i am not a psychologist the motor of the brain .PERIOD it's a drive .PERIOD and in fact ,COMMA i think it's more powerful than the sex drive .PERIOD you know ,COMMA you can feel it when you're just driving along in your car .PERIOD i think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time ,COMMA thereby conserving mating time and energy .PERIOD they've got incredible people skills negotiating skills .PERIOD they're highly imaginative and -- basic math .PERIOD we are seeing the rise of female sexual expression .PERIOD indeed ,COMMA arranged marriages are on their way off this braid of human life .PERIOD i even think that marriages might even become more stable ,COMMA because of the second great world trend .PERIOD it may decline some more ,COMMA not at any time on this planet .PERIOD have women been so educated .PERIOD so interesting so capable ,COMMA however ,COMMA there's always kinds of complications in this in these three brain systems lust romantic love and attachment .PERIOD -- don't always go together .PERIOD but i want to tell you a story about -- to illustrate .PERIOD i've been carrying on here about the biology of love ,COMMA and wasn't that rickshaw driver handsome .PERIOD these circuits are deeply embedded in the human brain .PERIOD they're going to survive as long as our species survives on what shakespeare called this mortal coil ,COMMA one of the threads that seems to have come through loud and clear in the last couple of days is this need to reconcile ,COMMA what the big wants -- ,COMMA the big being the organization ,COMMA the system ,COMMA the country -- and what the small wants -- ,COMMA the individual ,COMMA the person ,COMMA charlie ledbetter yesterday ,COMMA i thought talked very articulately about this need to bring consumers to bring people into the process of creating things .PERIOD and that's what i want to talk about today .PERIOD 319 .PERIOD i think something happens .PERIOD i think a head may appear in a second .PERIOD we showed them the whole cut ,COMMA and they were all completely .PERIOD what is this ?QUESTIONMARK and the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day ,COMMA all you do is look at the roof ,COMMA and it's a really shitty experience .PERIOD it's a history of invention based around this .PERIOD when we actually went and watched this procedure taking place -- ,COMMA and i'll explain this in a second -- .PERIOD it became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this that they really weren't recognizing .PERIOD why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence ?QUESTIONMARK because we kind of have to -- .PERIOD we're just compelled to .PERIOD we don't know why ,COMMA but we do .PERIOD so what is this ?QUESTIONMARK i hear you all ask ,COMMA no ,COMMA i don't .PERIOD so what seems like a very clunky product is ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA incredibly useful .PERIOD these guys are using this very successfully .PERIOD how far you can anticipate what follows from it ?QUESTIONMARK what are the threats ?QUESTIONMARK what are the possibilities ,COMMA the challenges ,COMMA the opportunities ?QUESTIONMARK and all the components are there ,COMMA which are now in common parlance in our vocabulary ,COMMA you know ,COMMA 30-odd years later ,COMMA wind energy ,COMMA recycling ,COMMA biomass solar cells .PERIOD for example ,COMMA if in that bucky-inspired phrase ,COMMA we draw back .PERIOD and we look at planet earth .PERIOD and we take a kind of typical industrialized society .PERIOD then the energy consumed would be split between the buildings ,COMMA 44 percent transport ,COMMA 34 percent and industry .PERIOD if you compared detroit with a city of a northern european example ,COMMA -- and munich is not a bad example of that with the greater dependence on walking and cycling -- ,COMMA then a city ,COMMA which is really only twice as dense is only using one-tenth of the energy .PERIOD in other words ,COMMA you take these comparable examples ,COMMA and the energy leap is enormous .PERIOD how does it affect the design of buildings ?QUESTIONMARK the one example i take is a corporate headquarters for a company called willis and faber in a small market town in the northeast of england ,COMMA commuting distance with london .PERIOD this building was wired for change .PERIOD in other words ,COMMA we didn't have the technology to do what would be really interesting on that building .PERIOD and if i fast-forward in time ,COMMA what is interesting is that the technology is now available and celebratory ,COMMA the library of the free university ,COMMA which opened last year is an example of that .PERIOD so it's not a kind of sacrifice quite the reverse ,COMMA and just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology ,COMMA the ability to plot points in the sky ,COMMA and to transmit to transfer that information .PERIOD now ,COMMA directly into the factory for wind tunnels ,COMMA we would literally put them in a wind tunnel and blast air ,COMMA and the many kilometers of cable .PERIOD and so on .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA major transformation ,COMMA it's been well known that the dead sea is dying .PERIOD how do you make them more friendly at that scale ,COMMA hong kong ?QUESTIONMARK i refer to as a kind of analog experience in a digital age ,COMMA because you always have a point of reference ,COMMA 250 -- .PERIOD excuse me .PERIOD 50000 people working 24 hours ,COMMA seven days .PERIOD contagious is a good word .PERIOD laughter is contagious .PERIOD passion is contagious ,COMMA and that directly increased student wellbeing .PERIOD and that can't happen in a classroom and ahmedabad got the first child-friendly zebra crossing in the world .PERIOD man ,COMMA this program is wonderful .PERIOD we have to start collecting from 555 kbs .PERIOD so the charter of compassion starts right here .PERIOD it was incredible .PERIOD now ,COMMA i was paid in dollars as a consultant .PERIOD and i looked at my income tax return and tried to ask myself ,COMMA is there a line in my return ,COMMA which shows how much of this income has gone to the people whose knowledge has made it possible ?QUESTIONMARK i tried to convince myself that no ,COMMA no ,COMMA i have worked for the policy changes .PERIOD and this was a moment of great pain and trauma ,COMMA because i couldn't live with it any longer .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA they invite the honey bees through their colors ,COMMA and the bees don't keep all the honey for themselves .PERIOD these are the three guiding principles of the honey ,COMMA bee network that whenever we learn something from people ,COMMA it must be shared with them in their language .PERIOD you cannot discriminate .PERIOD i'm so sorry to say that the rice that you ate in the lunch .PERIOD and you will eat today is transplanted by women bending in a very awkward posture ,COMMA millions of them every season in the paddy season ,COMMA when they transplant paddy with their feet in the water and feet in the water will develop fungus infections and that infection pains ,COMMA because then other insects bite that point .PERIOD and this is what he got painted .PERIOD there could be nothing more wrong than the maslowian model of hierarchy of needs ,COMMA because the poorest people in this country can get enlightenment .PERIOD so here's a model where a two-wheeler washing machine .PERIOD so it is better .PERIOD it is safer .PERIOD it is affordable .PERIOD it is energy-efficient .PERIOD so why are people willing to adjust with that mismatch ?QUESTIONMARK for example ,COMMA cell phones .PERIOD we have 400 million cellphones in this country .PERIOD now ,COMMA the eminent model ,COMMA the long-tail model tells you that small sales of a large number of books .PERIOD for example ,COMMA having only a few copies sold can still be a viable model .PERIOD look at what he is doing ,COMMA but he has modified a two-wheeler so that he can get autonomy and freedom and flexibility .PERIOD and we have a very vibrant network in china ,COMMA particularly ,COMMA but also emerging in brazil and other parts of the world .PERIOD i can't change the condition of the road ,COMMA but i can make the cycle run faster .PERIOD and this is a donkey cart ,COMMA which they modified .PERIOD this is in china .PERIOD this girl needed a breathing apparatus .PERIOD there's a whole range of innovations that we have a car ,COMMA which runs on compressed air with six paisa per kilometer .PERIOD and he didn't mean the comfort of a five-course dinner ,COMMA as opposed to a one-course meal .PERIOD but he really meant the comfort of the quality of the building for the people .PERIOD so in an indirect way ,COMMA you can see the sun .PERIOD and what they did is they created an integral building element to improve the quality of the space that surrounds the visitors of the museum .PERIOD they created this shade that you can see here ,COMMA which actually covers the sun ,COMMA but opens up to the good light from the sky .PERIOD they allowed themselves a few mistakes along the way .PERIOD this is richard kelly who was born 100 years ago ,COMMA which is the reason i bring him up now ,COMMA because it's kind of an anniversary year .PERIOD he meant something like this -- ,COMMA where the light gives direction to the space ,COMMA and helps you to get around these three distinct elements together ,COMMA make a lighting environment that helps us to feel better .PERIOD how do they share their culture ?QUESTIONMARK the problem is though that i wanted to explain to you how this really works -- ,COMMA but i can have four of these on my finger ,COMMA so you would not to be able to really see them .PERIOD so just to explain ,COMMA why are all these motorways permanently lit ?QUESTIONMARK can we maybe be much more selective and create better environments that also benefit from darkness .PERIOD can we engage people more in the lighting projects that we create ?QUESTIONMARK so they really want to connect with it like here ,COMMA where have they come from ?QUESTIONMARK where are they going ?QUESTIONMARK and it only embodies all these stories and all this suspense because of the darkness and the light .PERIOD they pointed out that i believe it was between 30 and 50 years from today ,COMMA they will be steering cars by wire without all that mechanical stuff .PERIOD it really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it in the ibot for the disabled community .PERIOD the big idea here is ,COMMA i think a new piece of a solution to a fairly big problem in transportation ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA in that time ,COMMA 91 percent of america lived either on farms or in small towns .PERIOD so the car -- ,COMMA the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage -- was a big deal .PERIOD it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage .PERIOD it all made sense with 91 percent of the people living there .PERIOD three million people die every year in cities .PERIOD due to bad air and almost all particulate pollution on this planet is produced by transportation devices ,COMMA particularly sitting in cities .PERIOD i don't look like a motor vehicle .PERIOD we're a recreational vehicle that doesn't really matter .PERIOD and i don't spend my time doing that kind of stuff .PERIOD then she looks up .PERIOD she's looking up .PERIOD and she says ,COMMA and i'm 81 years old ,COMMA and i don't drive a car anymore .PERIOD we need water .PERIOD we figured out how to put a vapor-compression distiller on this thing with a counter-flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat ,COMMA then using a little bit of the electricity control that process and for 450 watts ,COMMA which is a little more than half of its waste heat .PERIOD it will make 10 gallons an hour of distilled water from anything that comes into it to cool it .PERIOD so if we put this box on here in a few years ,COMMA could we have a solution to transportation electricity and communication and maybe drinkable water in a sustainable package that weighs 60 pounds .PERIOD we tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important .PERIOD we'll typically do it twice once we want to do it first .PERIOD and then it's time to do it again .PERIOD last year ,COMMA after it falls below a critical price ,COMMA it will tend if it's successful to rise above a critical mass ,COMMA a penetration .PERIOD and maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them and bring the rest of your entertainment in .PERIOD this is a fascinating research from who that shows the effect of generic drugs on anti-retroviral drug compounds .PERIOD and cocktails ,COMMA linux is another good example .PERIOD two percent isn't 20 percent ,COMMA but in the car business ,COMMA which is slow moving .PERIOD that's huge .PERIOD that's arrival .PERIOD free is something that comes with digital ,COMMA because the reproduction costs are essentially free .PERIOD it comes with ip because it's such an efficient protocol .PERIOD it comes with fiber optics ,COMMA because there's so much bandwidth .PERIOD it's an economic force .PERIOD it's a technical force .PERIOD you know ,COMMA there could be a film's [unclear] there ,COMMA but it's basically every song ever made could be stored on 400 dollars worth of storage by 2008 .PERIOD it takes that entire element the physical element of songs off the table ,COMMA because of some of technologies we've been talking about .PERIOD and by definition ,COMMA every one of you who is in this room ,COMMA must consider yourself a global soul ,COMMA a global citizen ,COMMA even more problematic .PERIOD they're not listening to poor people themselves in 2002 .PERIOD i met this incredible entrepreneur named amitabha sadangi from india who'd been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet .PERIOD and he was expressing his frustration that the aid market had bypassed .PERIOD low-income farmers altogether ,COMMA despite the fact that 200 million farmers alone in india make under a dollar a day .PERIOD but the market also had bypassed low income farmers ,COMMA because these systems were both too expensive ,COMMA and they were constructed for fields that were too large .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA when you go back to the beginning ,COMMA there were no private investors who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology for a market class that made under a dollar a day that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet .PERIOD and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors .PERIOD agriculture secondarily ,COMMA we wanted to see if we could export this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries .PERIOD in arusha ,COMMA tanzania ,COMMA a to z textile manufacturing has worked in partnership with us with unicef ,COMMA with the global fund to create a factory that now employs 7000 people ,COMMA mostly women .PERIOD so that in the terrorist attacks of november ,COMMA they were the first responder and are now beginning to scale ,COMMA because of partnership ,COMMA president obama understands that it's not hyperbole to say that these civil society institutions .PERIOD and these social entrepreneurs are building real alternatives to the taliban .PERIOD it was about 115 degrees .PERIOD and because i wanted to impress you all with slides since i saw the great presentations yesterday with graphs ,COMMA i made a graph that moves .PERIOD and i talk about the makeup of me during the hurricane .PERIOD you had msnbc posting about the hurricane on their blog .PERIOD updating it frequently .PERIOD this was possible because of the easy nature of blogging tools .PERIOD they sent a search party .PERIOD and i overheard people saying ,COMMA they wish i had killed myself jumped off bible peak .PERIOD and i won it .PERIOD i reached all of these people .PERIOD and i had tens of thousands of people reading about my life everyday .PERIOD and then i wrote a post about a banjo and my husband -- .PERIOD this is my husband who is very hot -- .PERIOD he won an award for being hot -- -- .PERIOD he told me you cannot buy a banjo .PERIOD and those people who know me understood my joke ,COMMA how much money does he spend on beer in a year .PERIOD and then i got people saying leave him .PERIOD and why are they reading this ?QUESTIONMARK this is not science .PERIOD but this was enough for me to be really so interested in how we have evolved and how we can trace our line .PERIOD this is the only picture i have .PERIOD and to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs to think about the people who are on those $100 computers ,COMMA talking about who they are sharing these personal stories -- .PERIOD this is an amazing thing and -- .PERIOD and so i printed out her -- ,COMMA or i sent a pdf of her blog to her family ,COMMA and they passed it out at her memorial service .PERIOD and even in her obituary ,COMMA they mentioned her blog ,COMMA because it was such a big part of her life .PERIOD you can see in its shape and its streamlined design .PERIOD it's powered for ocean .PERIOD swimming .PERIOD it flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins gets lift powers ,COMMA its movements with a lunate tail .PERIOD this tuna symbolizes what's the problem for all of us in the room .PERIOD so take a look at that animal .PERIOD so in a program called tag-a-giant ,COMMA we've actually gone from ireland to canada from corsica to spain .PERIOD and that's the fisheries off the state of north carolina .PERIOD they're coming together that could be tuna sex -- .PERIOD and there it is so from data like this ,COMMA we're able now to put the map up .PERIOD and in this map ,COMMA you see thousands of positions generated by this decade and a half of tagging .PERIOD salmon sharks ,COMMA go down to the tropics to pup and come into monterey .PERIOD we just need to put it together .PERIOD we have the technology that's shown us where it is .PERIOD hi there .PERIOD i'm hasan .PERIOD i'm an artist .PERIOD basically ,COMMA this is the fbi offices in tampa ,COMMA where i spent six months of my life ,COMMA -- back and forth ,COMMA not six months continuously or questions ,COMMA such as -- ,COMMA actually during the polygraph ,COMMA which was how it finally ended after nine consecutive of them -- .PERIOD one of the polygraph questions was ,COMMA and it's like guys ,COMMA i travel a lot .PERIOD don't want to make it look like .PERIOD i'm making any sudden moves .PERIOD and so i just kept doing this over and over and over .PERIOD then i'd make websites .PERIOD so you can see delta 1252 going from kansas city to atlanta .PERIOD this was on delta 719 going from jfk to san francisco .PERIOD these are the airports that i hang out in ,COMMA because i like airports ,COMMA but if you can cross-reference this with the other data ,COMMA then you're basically replaying ,COMMA the roll of the fbi agent ,COMMA and putting it all together .PERIOD this is exactly where my old apartment in san francisco was .PERIOD and then sometimes you get this .PERIOD so there's multiple databases ,COMMA so there's different categorizations of meals ,COMMA eaten outside empty train stations ,COMMA empty gas stations .PERIOD at 156 pm was this one at 459 pm was this one ,COMMA every few moments i shoot the image .PERIOD so ,COMMA by me ,COMMA putting all this information out there ,COMMA what i'm basically telling you is ,COMMA i'm telling you everything .PERIOD and the reason their information has any value is well ,COMMA because no one else has access to it .PERIOD and by me cutting out the middle man and giving it straight to you the information that the fbi has has no value .PERIOD so thus devaluing their currency .PERIOD so in a way ,COMMA i'm glad that i'm completely obsolete .PERIOD and you know ,COMMA some of my friends have always said ,COMMA hey ,COMMA you're just paranoid .PERIOD why are you doing this ?QUESTIONMARK so you can see that the homeland security likes to come by -- department of homeland security .PERIOD bruno giussani :COLON hasan ,COMMA just curious .PERIOD so it's just become another day ,COMMA and everything's automated at the other end on the day ,COMMA you are in a place where there is no coverage .PERIOD the fbi gets crazy .PERIOD well ,COMMA it goes to the last point that i was at hasan .PERIOD thank you very much .PERIOD you all know the truth of what i'm going to say ,COMMA but first see what a miserable lot .PERIOD we are even the people just below the top have less good health than the people at the top .PERIOD and there you see it in relation to the measure of inequality .PERIOD i've just shown you which i shall use over and over again in the data .PERIOD that's very important in poorer countries ,COMMA but not in the rich developed world .PERIOD but in the more equal societies ,COMMA it rises to 60 or 65 percent .PERIOD this is violence .PERIOD there's a about a tenfold difference .PERIOD there log scale up the side ,COMMA but it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison .PERIOD basically ,COMMA it's asking do rich fathers ,COMMA have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons ,COMMA or is there no relationship between the two one is that in graph after graph ,COMMA we find the countries that do worse ,COMMA whatever ,COMMA the outcome seem to be the more unequal ones .PERIOD and the ones that do well seem to be the nordic countries and japan .PERIOD it's not just one or two things that go wrong .PERIOD it's most things i am not talking about perfect equality .PERIOD i'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies .PERIOD it also leads to status insecurity .PERIOD the big change in our understanding of drivers of chronic health in the rich developed world is how important chronic stress from social sources is affecting the immune system ,COMMA the cardiovascular system .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD well ,COMMA i didn't have that in mind .PERIOD so the acid will ruin the gold plating beneath .PERIOD it is a wonderful knife ,COMMA no ,COMMA but is it fun ?QUESTIONMARK so i type design emotion .PERIOD and my website wasn't first again .PERIOD it's so much fun to drive .PERIOD and then a psychologist alice isen did this wonderful experiment .PERIOD so she'd bring people into the room ,COMMA and there'd be a string hanging down here and a string hanging down here .PERIOD you get a little problem .PERIOD you say ,COMMA ah ,COMMA i'll figure it out .PERIOD there's an amazing amount of stuff that's built into the brain .PERIOD behavioral is subconscious .PERIOD you're unaware of it ,COMMA almost everything we do is subconscious .PERIOD and the tea is sitting in this stuff to the right -- .PERIOD the tea is to the right of this line .PERIOD and the reason you might buy it now is because you care about the environment ,COMMA the other neat thing .PERIOD so that's the new me .PERIOD the graph was interesting ,COMMA although you need to consider it carefully ,COMMA it did not correlate with the size of classrooms .PERIOD if you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools ,COMMA where the score was 30 percent .PERIOD and let's say took that up to 40 percent -- that will be a completely different thing .PERIOD the last question is what everybody said ,COMMA but you know ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA they must have poked their head over the wall and asked the people in your office .PERIOD can you show me how to do it ?QUESTIONMARK and then somebody taught him .PERIOD he came there ,COMMA and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad .PERIOD i left the computer there with lots of cds -- .PERIOD i didn't have any internet -- and came back three months later .PERIOD and as soon as they saw me ,COMMA they said ,COMMA we need a faster processor and a better mouse .PERIOD so i said ,COMMA but how did you understand what's going on over there ?QUESTIONMARK so then i measured ,COMMA and they were using 200 english words with each other -- mispronounced ,COMMA but correct usage .PERIOD -- words like exit ,COMMA stop find save that kind of thing .PERIOD not only to do with the computer ,COMMA but in their day-to-day conversations .PERIOD this is the himalayas up in the north very cold .PERIOD i want to just cut this short we did this over and over again .PERIOD so if they have access to the computer ,COMMA they will teach themselves including intelligence ,COMMA but we got a clean learning curve almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school .PERIOD i'll leave it at that .PERIOD because i mean it sort of says it all doesn't it an educational technology and pedagogy that is digital automatic ,COMMA fault-tolerant minimally ,COMMA invasive connected and self-organized .PERIOD and it's about rediscovering idealism in all of that wreckage ,COMMA i negotiated with saddam's diplomats at the un .PERIOD i'd already served in germany ,COMMA norway various other places .PERIOD but i was posted to new york to serve on the un security council for the british delegation .PERIOD and there i dealt with things like the middle east peace process ,COMMA the lockerbie issue -- .PERIOD we can talk about that later ,COMMA if you wish -- ,COMMA but above all ,COMMA my responsibility was iraq and its weapons of mass destruction and the sanctions ,COMMA we placed on iraq to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons .PERIOD i decided to take a sabbatical ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA at the new school .PERIOD bruce .PERIOD so took a running leap and jumped over the edge of a cliff .PERIOD but in a way i've got used to the sensation of it .PERIOD a lot of my friends were still in it .PERIOD it was anarchy .PERIOD and it's a very horrible thing to see anarchy to know that the police and the military -- .PERIOD there were lots of military troops .PERIOD there -- actually can't stop that rampaging mob who's coming down the street .PERIOD they were not allowed a foreign office to help them deal with this immensely complicated process ,COMMA which became known as the final status process of kosovo .PERIOD and i came to kosovo and advised the kosovo government ,COMMA if they can't do it who's left to deal with it .PERIOD so we will be bringing darfuri rebel groups .PERIOD the northern cypriots and the southern cypriots rebels from aceh and awful long laundry list of chaotic conflicts around the world that is the politics of the 21st century ,COMMA and in a way ,COMMA independent diplomat ,COMMA embodies that fragmentation that change that is happening to all of us .PERIOD now today we're not talking about good and bad tv .PERIOD this is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom is television ,COMMA literally ,COMMA functioning as our conscience tempting us and rewarding us at the same time we surveyed the top-20 nielsen shows every year for 50 years .PERIOD -- ,COMMA a thousand shows viewers had responded dramatically .PERIOD this was the first show that allowed viewers to say my god .PERIOD i can comment on how i feel about the vietnam war about the presidency through television .PERIOD it can change us that's mapped against the red dot unemployment ,COMMA which is a simple bureau of labor department statistic .PERIOD we had the bursting of the tech bubble .PERIOD i can vote you off the island .PERIOD there has not been a decade of television without a definitive .PERIOD dominant tv ,COMMA mom ,COMMA maude findlay ,COMMA the epitome of the irreverent 1970s who tackled abortion .PERIOD divorce ,COMMA even menopause on tv .PERIOD murphy brown took on a vice president ,COMMA when she took on the idea of single parenthood ,COMMA this era's ,COMMA mom ,COMMA bree van de kamp .PERIOD so here's the metaphor .PERIOD i'm offering today previous to this time .PERIOD i was very selfish and self-righteous ,COMMA and on this higher level ,COMMA he becomes loving and forgiving .PERIOD but here's the weirdest place of all war .PERIOD i passes insensibly into a we my becomes our and individual faith loses its central importance .PERIOD now ,COMMA profane is the opposite of sacred .PERIOD it just means ordinary or common durkheim believed that anything that unites us takes on an air of sacredness .PERIOD i'm offering the metaphor of a staircase in the mind .PERIOD so here's the million-dollar question for social scientists ,COMMA like me ,COMMA is the staircase a feature of our evolutionary design ,COMMA or is it a bug ?QUESTIONMARK a mistake in the system ?QUESTIONMARK -- ?QUESTIONMARK this religious stuff is just something that happens when the wires cross in the brain .PERIOD -- ,COMMA jill has a stroke ,COMMA and she has this religious experience .PERIOD it's just a mistake .PERIOD there's a mutation in the gene and one of them mutates to follow a selfish strategy .PERIOD it's so big and powerful and efficient that it can take resources from the greens from the defectors ,COMMA the cheaters .PERIOD and pretty soon the whole population is actually composed of these new superorganisms .PERIOD we're not locked into cooperation the way bees .PERIOD and ants are we're bees .PERIOD we busted out of the hive .PERIOD during the enlightenment ,COMMA we unleashed earth-changing creativity and generated vast wealth and comfort what's missing .PERIOD and that gives me hope ,COMMA because people are not purely selfish .PERIOD every man is a piece of the continent ,COMMA a part of the main .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD there was no more space in the house .PERIOD so i went out to the backyard ,COMMA and without any previous building experience and about 3000 dollars and some recycled materials .PERIOD i built this space .PERIOD there was enough space ,COMMA and i had control which was very important .PERIOD he won the silver medal for ireland in the 1992 olympics .PERIOD and he trains in this space .PERIOD he trains other people museum quality .PERIOD i had requested slides kind of adamantly up till the -- pretty much last few days ,COMMA but was denied access to a slide projector .PERIOD these are a couple of garage doors painted identical situated next to each other .PERIOD so here's the first door ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you get the message .PERIOD this is for a book by metropolis .PERIOD when i first contacted william burroughs about being part of it .PERIOD he said ,COMMA no ,COMMA he said ,COMMA he didn't believe it was the end of print .PERIOD and also surprisingly ,COMMA it was done in kind of a cheap metal ,COMMA and it had completely rusted through and water everywhere and spiders .PERIOD and i thought ,COMMA you know ,COMMA what were they thinking got no way of tracking it ?QUESTIONMARK so i could be totally wrong .PERIOD i don't have the site .PERIOD it's just the piece itself .PERIOD i found out that's very true working on this campaign worldwide .PERIOD but anyway ,COMMA this is one of the ads .PERIOD i was most pleased with because they were all elaborately art-directed .PERIOD and this one ,COMMA i thought actually felt like the girl was looking at the computer in germany .PERIOD they made one small change without checking with me -- ,COMMA nor did they have to because it was done through agencies -- ,COMMA but see if you can tell the difference .PERIOD so i understand their logic .PERIOD i totally disagree with it .PERIOD i think it's a very small-minded approach .PERIOD the world is certainly much more global .PERIOD and i certainly think the people of germany could have handled a little black girl sitting in front of a computer ,COMMA though we'll never know article on bryan ferry -- ,COMMA just really boring article -- .PERIOD so i set the whole article in dingbat .PERIOD it's kind of horsey type ,COMMA but the texture -- .PERIOD the second plane ,COMMA not quite hitting .PERIOD there was something more enticing .PERIOD if that's the right -- .PERIOD it's not the right word -- .PERIOD but in this cover than time or newsweek ,COMMA it did not let up .PERIOD there were a lot of orphans made this day .PERIOD and here's a dead body being brought out .PERIOD this is my desktop .PERIOD this is -- .PERIOD i like found art hand lettering's coming back in a big way .PERIOD and i thought this was a great example of both .PERIOD but i was asked to give a talk at a conference in sacramento a few years back .PERIOD and i remembered seeing this photograph of my father ,COMMA who was a test pilot .PERIOD and he told me that when you signed up to become a test pilot ,COMMA they told you that there was a 40 to 50 percent chance of death on the job .PERIOD i've spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about before that obviously technology didn't exist .PERIOD but obviously it did ,COMMA but it's still very ,COMMA very productive .PERIOD so i'm attempting to say ,COMMA if we take technology's view of the world ,COMMA what does it want ?QUESTIONMARK and i think ,COMMA once we ask that question ,COMMA we have to go back actually to life .PERIOD because obviously ,COMMA if we keep extending the origins of technology far back ,COMMA i think we come back to life at some point .PERIOD brian farrell's work is all part of this agenda ,COMMA to try and actually discover all the species on earth more and more of the inert matter of the globe is being touched and animated by life .PERIOD and the last thing i bring back this nudibranch .PERIOD and so the general long-term trends of evolution are roughly these five ubiquity diversity ,COMMA specialization ,COMMA complexity and socialization .PERIOD now ,COMMA i took that and said ,COMMA ok ,COMMA what are the long-term trends in technology that we see ?QUESTIONMARK there's a general hammer and hammers become more and more specific over time .PERIOD there's obviously diversity huge numbers of things .PERIOD so the major trends in technology ,COMMA evolution actually are the same as in biological evolution .PERIOD the same drives that we see towards ubiquity towards diversity towards socialization towards complexity .PERIOD that is maybe not a big surprise .PERIOD because if we map out say ,COMMA the evolution of armor ,COMMA you can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary-type cladistic tree .PERIOD he has one of the world's largest collections -- about 500 of them .PERIOD but the most interesting aspect about this is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom ,COMMA those indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet that was no longer made that does not happen in biology .PERIOD and when we take that ,COMMA we take this idea of what culture is doing and add it to what the long-term trajectory -- again in life's evolution -- .PERIOD we find that each case -- ,COMMA each of the major transitions in life -- ,COMMA what they're really about is accelerating and changing the way in which evolution happens .PERIOD so ,COMMA all these steps in evolution are increasing ,COMMA basically the evolution of evolvability .PERIOD so if you have life hacking -- ,COMMA life means hacking the game of survival -- .PERIOD then evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game .PERIOD and each time we make a new opportunity place ,COMMA we're allowing a platform to make new ones .PERIOD that's what technology wants .PERIOD i'm going my gosh .PERIOD i had never seen anything like this in my life .PERIOD and you walk up to the front of the tank .PERIOD then you realize that these animals all have different personalities .PERIOD some of them would hold their ground .PERIOD others would slink into the back of the tank and disappear in the rocks and one in particular ,COMMA this amazing animal .PERIOD and what i learned in school though was really beneficial if you're a wildlife filmmaker ,COMMA and you're going out into the field to film animals especially behavior .PERIOD it helps to have a fundamental background on who these animals are how they work .PERIOD and you know a bit about their behaviors .PERIOD so we created a way to find out .PERIOD and i got my first look at that famous beak in action and octopus are they live in all the oceans .PERIOD and as you go deeper that lovely blue water ,COMMA you were launched in gives way to darker and darker blue .PERIOD and finally ,COMMA it's a rich lavender .PERIOD and after a couple of thousand feet ,COMMA it's ink black .PERIOD but we're just going to zip right past this area ,COMMA this area that includes about 95 percent of the living space on our planet and go to the mid-ocean ridge ,COMMA which i think is even more extraordinary .PERIOD and the top of this mountain range is splitting apart ,COMMA creating a rift valley .PERIOD the surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing .PERIOD and this kind of life and death of hydrothermal vent communities is going on every 30 or 40 years ,COMMA all along the ridge ,COMMA but encouragingly ,COMMA i've seen just the opposite .PERIOD well ,COMMA how it happened is the local community galvanized .PERIOD and these problems are so large and global .PERIOD and it's just overwhelming .PERIOD my answer to that is don't look at the big ,COMMA overwhelming issues of the world .PERIOD and we can make changes to our behavior that will influence and affect the environment like those people changed the health of that bay .PERIOD i was afraid of womanhood ,COMMA not that i'm not afraid now .PERIOD but i've learned to pretend i've learned to be flexible back in the '50s and '60s .PERIOD when i was growing up little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful and pretty and gentle and soft .PERIOD and we were supposed to fit into roles that were sort of shadowy -- really not quite clear .PERIOD what we were supposed to be .PERIOD now ,COMMA my mother was different ,COMMA and i just ate it up because women are on the ground floor .PERIOD and we know the traditions .PERIOD so ,COMMA well ,COMMA we can bring a different voice to the table .PERIOD and then also ,COMMA my family was in chaos .PERIOD and i drew to try to bring my family together .PERIOD -- -- ,COMMA try to bring my family together with laughter .PERIOD but i feel blessed to be able to work with them .PERIOD two hundred years ago ,COMMA the united states was less than a few percent urbanized .PERIOD it's now more than 82 percent .PERIOD now ,COMMA listen to this every week for the foreseeable future ,COMMA until 2050 ,COMMA every week ,COMMA more than a million people are being added to our cities .PERIOD however ,COMMA cities ,COMMA despite having this negative aspect to them are also the solution .PERIOD so we have this kind of dual nature .PERIOD that's the quest .PERIOD so here's two questions that i have in my head .PERIOD when i think about this problem ,COMMA we use them metaphorically -- ,COMMA the dna of a company ,COMMA the metabolism of a city .PERIOD and so on .PERIOD -- is that just bullshit metaphorical bullshit ,COMMA or is there serious substance to it ?QUESTIONMARK and if that is the case ,COMMA how come that ?QUESTIONMARK it's very hard to kill a city .PERIOD you could drop an atom bomb on a city .PERIOD and 30 years later ,COMMA it's surviving .PERIOD this is just a tiny range .PERIOD actually ,COMMA it's us mammals .PERIOD we're one of these rat .PERIOD that's a rat -- could have been you .PERIOD we're all pretty much the same .PERIOD and you see you're very familiar with this ,COMMA despite the fact that this is the most complex and diverse system in the universe .PERIOD there's an extraordinary simplicity being expressed by this .PERIOD so a wonderful thing about all of biology is that it expresses an extraordinary economy of scale .PERIOD and you're very familiar with these networks .PERIOD and here's the summary of what i'm saying heart rates are slower .PERIOD you live longer diffusion of oxygen and resources across membranes is slower .PERIOD etc .PERIOD here .PERIOD it is which says that the bigger you are ,COMMA the more you have per capita .PERIOD unlike biology ,COMMA -- higher wages ,COMMA more super-creative people per capita .PERIOD as you get bigger ,COMMA more patents per capita ,COMMA more crime ,COMMA per capita .PERIOD see companies .PERIOD they scale there .PERIOD it is after some little fluctuations at the beginning .PERIOD when companies are innovating ,COMMA they scale beautifully .PERIOD but you notice i've cheated because i've only gone up to '94 .PERIOD and i put in front of them ,COMMA an authentic experience that allowed them to learn for themselves .PERIOD the problem then becomes ,COMMA how do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful ?QUESTIONMARK and they know what to do with it .PERIOD i moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated ,COMMA the way that i knew that kids learned .PERIOD and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you are willing to let go of some of the paradigms of the past of information scarcity ,COMMA when my grandmother was in school ,COMMA and when my father was in school ,COMMA and even when i was in school ,COMMA and to a moment ,COMMA when we have information surplus ,COMMA it asked them to create for themselves ,COMMA and it allowed them to fail process ,COMMA learn from ask them to go to places to see things for themselves to actually experience the learning to play to inquire .PERIOD this is one of my favorite photos ,COMMA because this was taken on tuesday .PERIOD when i asked the students to go to the polls ,COMMA there are words that we're truly afraid of .PERIOD this was an issue from 2002 that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human regenerative .PERIOD medicine is what business week put up when they did a story about regenerative medicine ,COMMA not too long ago .PERIOD and you can basically see that the richer a country is the older .PERIOD the people are within it .PERIOD and why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now in 2010 ,COMMA two workers per retiree in the us ?QUESTIONMARK this is age versus cost of health care .PERIOD this video ,COMMA i think gets across the concept that i'm talking about quite dramatically .PERIOD the way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body in a child before the age of about six months ,COMMA if they lose their fingertip in an accident ,COMMA they'll re-grow their fingertip .PERIOD we heard yesterday about the importance of new materials .PERIOD i wouldn't be telling you this story if it weren't compelling .PERIOD this is a horse .PERIOD the horse is not in pain after treatment .PERIOD that's what it looks like .PERIOD he chills the dish .PERIOD it changes its properties ,COMMA and he peels it right out of the dish .PERIOD it's the coolest stuff .PERIOD in this case ,COMMA at the end of the bypass operation ,COMMA you're going to see the stem cells from the patient .PERIOD that were removed at the beginning of the procedure ,COMMA being injected directly into the heart of the patient .PERIOD this was a randomized trial .PERIOD there go the cells .PERIOD here's another example of stem-cell therapy that isn't quite clinical yet .PERIOD but i think very soon will be .PERIOD so you could go in ,COMMA you could get your tummy-tuck .PERIOD japan is the oldest country on earth ,COMMA in terms of its average age in the united states ,COMMA we've had a somewhat different approach ,COMMA but there's been no strategic investment to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way .PERIOD and these tedsters are -- ,COMMA you know ,COMMA as innocent as that name sounds -- .PERIOD these are the philanthropists and artists and scientists who sort of shape our world .PERIOD and what could i possibly have to say that would be distinguished enough to justify my participation in something like that ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA my characters like the ones in my shows allow me to play with the spaces between those questions .PERIOD what i should tell you -- ,COMMA what i should tell you is that they've each prepared their own little ted talks ,COMMA well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA she calls herself black -- .PERIOD she's really more like a caramel color .PERIOD if you look at her ,COMMA frankly ,COMMA i'm kvelling just to be here with all the luminaries .PERIOD you have attending something like this .PERIOD you know ,COMMA so many others .PERIOD you see ,COMMA they're just wonderful .PERIOD but anyway ,COMMA i should have started by saying ,COMMA just how lucky i feel .PERIOD you know ,COMMA i couldn't have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl .PERIOD you know ,COMMA your parents must be very proud .PERIOD the point is i'm happy .PERIOD somebody has practical ideas to get us out of this mess .PERIOD so ,COMMA happy continued success .PERIOD sorry .PERIOD this is such a wonderful opportunity ,COMMA and everything to be here right now .PERIOD my name is noraida ,COMMA and i'm just -- .PERIOD i'm so thrilled to be part of like your ted conference that you're doing .PERIOD and everything like that .PERIOD actually ,COMMA you could say ,COMMA i grew up in the capital of dominican republic ,COMMA otherwise known as washington heights in new york city .PERIOD and i think he's mexican .PERIOD so that's -- honestly ,COMMA that's close enough for me ,COMMA right now .PERIOD so -- ,COMMA i just -- ,COMMA i'm sorry .PERIOD okay ,COMMA sorry .PERIOD so anyway ,COMMA what i was trying to say is that i really love ted like it's -- .PERIOD i can't get over this right now .PERIOD so basically ,COMMA like da bomb -- ,COMMA what dominican-american benevolent organization for mothers .PERIOD and babies does is basically we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise ,COMMA and who also happen to be mothers like me .PERIOD i come from a multicultural family ,COMMA and we were only 11 years old .PERIOD so it was not appropriate ,COMMA although ,COMMA you know it was wonderful .PERIOD well ,COMMA i just wanted to quickly say ,COMMA good evening .PERIOD but when sarah jones asked me to please come to ted ,COMMA i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA first ,COMMA i don't know that you know ,COMMA -- before two years ago ,COMMA you would not find me in front of an audience of people much less like this ,COMMA because i did not like to give speeches ,COMMA because i feel that as an immigrant .PERIOD i do not have good english skills for speaking ,COMMA but that's where we had some problems .PERIOD the daughter's marriage is very special to the mom .PERIOD and i said ,COMMA yes ,COMMA men can be difficult ,COMMA but all women have to get used to that .PERIOD so i always teach my kids to respect american ideas ,COMMA but i told my daughter that this is one exception ,COMMA -- -- that she is not gay .PERIOD she is just confused by this american problem .PERIOD thank you very ,COMMA very much .PERIOD i love you finished university education ,COMMA got a medical degree ,COMMA 1986 ,COMMA but critical poverty .PERIOD this slide is from a presentation i gave not that long ago .PERIOD gapminderorg tells the story of the gap between africa and the rest of the world in terms of health care .PERIOD yes ,COMMA i'm sorry if it upsets some of you .PERIOD but i think you need to see this .PERIOD that's the floor .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK because it's scary and it's expensive ,COMMA but we need to have it .PERIOD ok ,COMMA that's mike .PERIOD mike comes out from mississippi .PERIOD see .PERIOD that's one of the problems we have in nigeria .PERIOD and in africa ,COMMA generally ,COMMA it looks like all these americans are here .PERIOD and yes ,COMMA one brit .PERIOD and he's not going to do anything -- .PERIOD he thinks he's british ,COMMA actually .PERIOD and he's actually nigerian .PERIOD i just thought about that .PERIOD we eventually got it .PERIOD working is the truth ,COMMA but it was one of these even older than the one you saw .PERIOD no ,COMMA yes ,COMMA doesn't matter it worked .PERIOD and currently we're working on oxygen ,COMMA -- ,COMMA oxygen delivery on-site .PERIOD so that's not new what we're doing is applying this technology to it .PERIOD these are members of my graduating class 1986 .PERIOD and finally ,COMMA i get a call last year .PERIOD and then i have to go up after jj abrams hollywood gathers around power tables and the valley gathers around power tables .PERIOD but i'm actually here today to tell a story .PERIOD and what he said was ,COMMA he wasn't so much afraid that he might die ,COMMA but that he hadn't done the things that he wanted to with his life .PERIOD but for me ,COMMA personally ,COMMA it was a real change .PERIOD i went from living in a house with five guys in palo alto and living off their leftovers to all of a sudden ,COMMA having all kinds of resources ,COMMA connecting them together through conferences -- ,COMMA like a ted -- brings so many powerful connections ,COMMA or through the world forum on social entrepreneurship ,COMMA that my foundation does at oxford every year .PERIOD so in 2003 ,COMMA i started to make my way around los angeles to talk about the idea of a pro-social media company .PERIOD and i was met with a lot of encouragement ,COMMA one of the lines of encouragement that i heard over .PERIOD and over was the streets of hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you who think you're going to come to this town and make movies .PERIOD one of these films in particular called north country was actually kind of a box office disaster ,COMMA and that to me spoke volumes ,COMMA because it's -- .PERIOD the film started about a true-life story about a woman who was harassed sued her employer led to a landmark case that led to the equal opportunity act and the violence against women ,COMMA act and others .PERIOD at that point ,COMMA i thought i knew something about global warming ,COMMA and we have 10 films in production right now and dozens others in development .PERIOD and one thing that i've learned is that there's never one right way to make change .PERIOD and i can imagine if we do this ,COMMA the headlines in 10 years might read something like these new aids cases in africa fall to zero us imports its last barrel of oil ,COMMA -- -- israelis and palestinians celebrate 10 years of peaceful coexistence .PERIOD and i believe that working together ,COMMA we can make all of these things happen .PERIOD the next day ,COMMA all the artists were invited to join mandela in robben island ,COMMA where he was going to give a conference to the world's press standing in front of his former prison cell .PERIOD he was wearing a t-shirt like the one i wear .PERIOD now ,COMMA i've subsequently become an envoy for scotland and hiv .PERIOD i tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of hiv/aids orphans .PERIOD i think that's fair to say it's almost everyone in the hall .PERIOD but now we have this new layer of private sovereignty in cyberspace and their decisions about software coding engineering ,COMMA design terms of service ,COMMA all act as a kind of law that shapes what we can and cannot do with our digital lives .PERIOD the reality is that even in democratic societies today ,COMMA we do not have good answers for how you balance the need for security and law enforcement on one hand and protection of civil liberties and free speech on the other in our digital networks .PERIOD this is a map of social networks worldwide .PERIOD and certainly facebook has conquered much of the world -- ,COMMA which is either a good or a bad thing ,COMMA depending on how you like the way ,COMMA facebook manages its service in plain english that means censorship and surveillance of their users .PERIOD this has a chilling effect on people's ability to use the internet to hold government accountable .PERIOD thank you very much comparable in its own very peculiar way to the achievements of microsoft or google .PERIOD here are some of those same weightlifters after their 1989 makeover .PERIOD and so i resolved to travel around the world examining this global criminal underworld by talking to policemen by talking to victims by talking to consumers of illicit goods and services now organized crime in a globalizing world operates in the same way as any other business .PERIOD and it is this western desire to consume .PERIOD that is the primary driver of international organized crime .PERIOD and as a consequence of this trade britain alone lost eight billion dollars in revenue .PERIOD so what were these guys doing with all the money ?QUESTIONMARK they were making .PERIOD well ,COMMA this is where we come to globalization ,COMMA because that was not just the deregulation of global trade .PERIOD this one ,COMMA however ,COMMA is in central british columbia ,COMMA where i photographed it ,COMMA what they've done is they've shifted their operations .PERIOD people don't smoke as much dope or visit prostitutes quite so frequently during a recession .PERIOD and so ,COMMA as soon as i saw this drop into my inbox ,COMMA i dispatched it hastily to the recycle bin and spared myself ,COMMA a very nasty infection .PERIOD it's such a large conference mark serfaas .PERIOD it's pretty cool .PERIOD huh ?QUESTIONMARK pursuing happiness ?QUESTIONMARK i mean ,COMMA -- ,COMMA no ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA like in the ted sense ,COMMA 1860 -- ,COMMA am i good and my name ?QUESTIONMARK and it would tell me ,COMMA and i have to tell you right now .PERIOD this is an unadulterated piece of software .PERIOD this is a real internet browser .PERIOD and this is an actual google site ,COMMA and we're going to test it out live today .PERIOD am i feeling lucky ?QUESTIONMARK ze frank :COLON oh amazing .PERIOD needless to say ,COMMA i was able to leave my job .PERIOD four years later ,COMMA i still get probably two or three hundred emails a day from people .PERIOD i don't know .PERIOD and it's been an amazing opportunity to kind of get to know different cultures ,COMMA you know ,COMMA and that was embarrassing .PERIOD so the scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA this is incredible .PERIOD this is an 11-year-old .PERIOD girl -- drew this and submitted it .PERIOD it's just gorgeous .PERIOD none of the haikus were written by the same person .PERIOD and in fact ,COMMA no line was -- .PERIOD you know ,COMMA each line is contributed by a different person at a different -- at a different time .PERIOD it dances to music lotte reiniger ,COMMA an amazing shadow ,COMMA puppeteer in the '20s that started doing more elaborate things .PERIOD chris anderson :COLON ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA mr ,COMMA ze frank :COLON well ,COMMA this is 2009 .PERIOD so i'm going to talk about it .PERIOD we get the geneticists keeping on telling us how extremely closely .PERIOD we are related -- .PERIOD hardly any genes of difference very ,COMMA very closely related .PERIOD i'm not talking about airy-fairy stuff about culture or psychology or behavior .PERIOD professor tobias came over from south africa and spoke to university college london .PERIOD you've believed it through generations .PERIOD so that is what they have done .PERIOD now aaron filler from harvard said ,COMMA isn't it time ?QUESTIONMARK we stopped talking about selective pressures .PERIOD he kept it to himself for 30 years .PERIOD and at that time ,COMMA it became set in stone .PERIOD the aquatic theory should be dumped with the ufos and the yetis ,COMMA as part of the lunatic fringe of science ,COMMA i suggested it .PERIOD and people said ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA peals of merry laughter that crazy woman .PERIOD she's off again .PERIOD she'll say ,COMMA anything won't she .PERIOD this has come 'round to be that all those naked pachyderms have aquatic ancestors .PERIOD so this is a close connection between nakedness and water here .PERIOD you can't find anybody to compare it with ,COMMA because we're the only animal that walks upright on two legs .PERIOD there is only one circumstance in which they always all of them walk on two legs .PERIOD and that is when they are wading through water .PERIOD david attenborough thinks it's significant as the possible beginning of our bipedalism in the whale .PERIOD it's complete no fat inside at all all in blubber outside .PERIOD we can speak try to imagine a gorilla performing the same maneuver .PERIOD and you can see that compared with gorilla .PERIOD we are halfway to being shaped like a fish .PERIOD there is nothing there .PERIOD i don't believe it .PERIOD there was professor tobias .PERIOD he's come over daniel dennett .PERIOD he's come over .PERIOD so the third thing that might happen is a very beautiful thing .PERIOD i can tell you that in three words ,COMMA the textbooks don't mention it .PERIOD and it's pretty simple .PERIOD everybody's got one -- ,COMMA all of you .PERIOD and so when working as an interaction designer ,COMMA or as an artist ,COMMA who deals with participation -- creating things that live on in or around the human form ,COMMA -- ,COMMA it's really a powerful space to work within .PERIOD and it is a tool that actually enables one to listen to their own innards .PERIOD when i meet a glacier for the very first time ,COMMA what do i do ?QUESTIONMARK do ?QUESTIONMARK i carve a message in the snow ,COMMA but really the most satisfying experience .PERIOD i've had is the act of listening ,COMMA which is what we need in any good relationship ,COMMA and just as with the wall ,COMMA how i wanted to be more wall-like with this project .PERIOD i'd actually like to take more a of glacial pace .PERIOD so how do you do that that doesn't move ?QUESTIONMARK here's my promise to you ,COMMA if you are consistent and do this within three months ,COMMA the elected official will start calling you when that issue comes up and say ,COMMA what do you think ?QUESTIONMARK now ,COMMA when you approach these animals ,COMMA you need to understand ,COMMA there's a dangerous end to them .PERIOD and you also need to approach them with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness .PERIOD if you had the right information ,COMMA you would have done the right thing .PERIOD if they follow protocol ,COMMA they'll pick up the phone and say ,COMMA hey ,COMMA do you have the original ?QUESTIONMARK and you actually get into the folder that the elected official actually has to read .PERIOD so what your letter means i've got to tell you we are all in a party .PERIOD and political officials are the pinatas living systems are in constant conversation with the natural world ,COMMA through sets of chemical reactions called metabolism .PERIOD and this is the conversion of one group of substances into another either through the production ,COMMA or the absorption of energy .PERIOD now ,COMMA that's exactly the kind of process that i'm interested in when we're thinking about sustainable materials ,COMMA it is able to move around its environment .PERIOD it can follow chemical gradients ,COMMA it can undergo complex reactions some of which are happily architectural here .PERIOD this is a protocell ,COMMA and it's vigorously shedding this skin .PERIOD the protocells can actually move away from the light .PERIOD so this is really interesting .PERIOD now we have an architecture that connects a city to the natural world in a very direct and immediate way .PERIOD this is a river .PERIOD the reasons vary state to state ,COMMA but mostly in the details .PERIOD but as more people showed up wanting water ,COMMA the folks who were there first got a little concerned .PERIOD and in 1865 montana passed its first water law .PERIOD there's another thing happening around the country ,COMMA which is that companies are starting to get concerned about their water footprint .PERIOD so what can they do about this remaining water footprint that can have serious effects on the ecosystem ?QUESTIONMARK he doesn't lose the water ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK he just chooses to apply that right or some portion of it to the stream .PERIOD instead of to the land .PERIOD this guy's measuring the water that this leaves in the stream .PERIOD he's by far the happiest man ever measured by science .PERIOD compassion is fun ,COMMA therefore to create the conditions for global compassion .PERIOD all we have to do is to reframe compassion as something that is fun .PERIOD these are leaders who are highly ambitious for the greater good .PERIOD and they according to the research ,COMMA make the best business leaders .PERIOD and if you look at these qualities in the context of compassion ,COMMA we find that the cognitive and affective components of compassion ,COMMA -- understanding people and empathizing with people -- inhibits tones down what i call the excessive self-obsession .PERIOD that's in us ,COMMA therefore ,COMMA creating the conditions for humility .PERIOD this awareness of serving the greater good is very self-inspiring .PERIOD and it creates fertile ground for compassion to grow in .PERIOD that's one .PERIOD the second ingredient is autonomy .PERIOD and this also creates the conditions for compassion .PERIOD in the workplace .PERIOD i found this to be true both on the individual level ,COMMA and at a corporate level .PERIOD and what i recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end torture as an investigative tool ,COMMA we often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst .PERIOD but in fact ,COMMA 95 percent of torture today is not for political prisoners .PERIOD so it's just a place where there was no rule of law in burundi .PERIOD i walked into a prison ,COMMA and it wasn't a 12-year-old boy .PERIOD it was an 8-year-old boy for stealing ,COMMA a mobile phone .PERIOD and when i walked up to the prison director ,COMMA i said you've got to let her out .PERIOD so the pieces are not only the training of the lawyers ,COMMA but us finding a way to systematically implement early access to counsel ,COMMA because they are the safeguard in the system for people who are being tortured .PERIOD but the third and most important thing is that we make a commitment to this .PERIOD and the reason that i think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery or end apartheid .PERIOD so ,COMMA you know ,COMMA there's bars .PERIOD and by the time that vishna was getting bigger ,COMMA which means what gets bigger ,COMMA your head gets bigger .PERIOD so he would come to the first bar the second bar ,COMMA and then the third bar ,COMMA and then really slowly move his head .PERIOD so he could fit through and come back third second first ,COMMA and he would grab my pinkie ,COMMA because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit ,COMMA and i will do the one thing that i can do .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD we were in queens .PERIOD we were building the big big ,COMMA big ,COMMA big building in midtown .PERIOD so we were in the small ,COMMA small ,COMMA small boondocks ,COMMA but it's not only that in italy .PERIOD in milan ,COMMA especially contemporary .PERIOD art really doesn't have that much of a place .PERIOD they tried to make a toddler's gas mask in such a way that the toddler can be held by the parent ,COMMA because proximity of the body is so important instead ,COMMA she said ,COMMA no ,COMMA no work and leisure can be together .PERIOD yeah .PERIOD that's particularly gorgeous -- .PERIOD it's the tv dinner of 2001 .PERIOD i would like ,COMMA instead to talk about how great some designers are .PERIOD it's a long story ,COMMA because it started before 2001 .PERIOD and it was called emergency so designers sometimes don't do things that are immediately functional ,COMMA but they're functional to our understanding of issues .PERIOD this is cindy van den bremen ,COMMA who is a dutch designer .PERIOD that's done this series of capsters .PERIOD they range from this fluffy toy that is about hugging .PERIOD you -- because autistic children like to be hugged tight .PERIOD so it has a spring inside -- all the way to this doll with a mirror .PERIOD so the child can see him or herself in the mirror and regain a sense of self .PERIOD design really looks upon the whole world .PERIOD and it considers the world in all of its different ranges .PERIOD and it was really interesting ,COMMA because i was the last speaker .PERIOD and before me ,COMMA there were people that were really talking about luxury .PERIOD and i didn't want to be a party pooper .PERIOD but at the same time ,COMMA i felt that i had to kind of bring back the discourse to reality .PERIOD the rhythm of the sinusoids has changed tremendously just like the rhythm of our life in the past 25 years .PERIOD so i'm not sure anymore ,COMMA what the wavelength is ,COMMA but design and science and the possibility of visualizing different scales .PERIOD and therefore ,COMMA really work at the scale of the very small to make it very big and very meaningful .PERIOD so africa is a complex continent .PERIOD full of contradictions .PERIOD as you can see ,COMMA and i want to tell you that this is my story ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK and it's the story of many of the africans who are here .PERIOD and my father said ,COMMA ok ,COMMA listen .PERIOD so we went to the school ,COMMA and because we were nobodies ,COMMA and because we didn't have privilege .PERIOD and because my father didn't have the right last name .PERIOD he was treated like dirt .PERIOD but the money ran out .PERIOD you don't see the blogger .PERIOD you don't see the harvard-educated lawyer ,COMMA the vibrant person ,COMMA you know ,COMMA and you didn't know about the windmill .PERIOD you know ,COMMA and i was just moved .PERIOD so what is to be done ?QUESTIONMARK and this is an example .PERIOD you know ,COMMA blogging is one way of doing that .PERIOD so we need to start getting better and going back to the point .PERIOD i was trying to make .PERIOD this is the swahili .PERIOD wikipedia swahili is spoken by about 50 million people in east africa .PERIOD so that's a start .PERIOD and we've heard of all their other initiatives .PERIOD i walked away from a job with one of the top firms in dc covington and burling ,COMMA six figures .PERIOD what are they doing practically ?QUESTIONMARK i mean ,COMMA when i was a first-year student in law school ,COMMA my mom's business had collapsed .PERIOD so i was supporting her .PERIOD my sister was struggling to get through undergrad .PERIOD an example .PERIOD this man changed my life .PERIOD i said ,COMMA i want to be a lawyer .PERIOD and i'm like because i'm here ,COMMA and it's cheap .PERIOD and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i kind of like pittsburgh .PERIOD i was also building something called the copenhagen wheel ,COMMA which is just a really beautiful beautiful electric bike at a lab at mit called senseable city lab .PERIOD this is a place where my friend abhishek sen was interning .PERIOD and that's his actual photograph .PERIOD she told me that this is how you would typically test for anemia .PERIOD but this is not available in parol .PERIOD but fundamentally what i believe is that the map behind of me is called basically the map of anemia .PERIOD and when i walked in ,COMMA she was already at the table .PERIOD and she said ,COMMA i saw your talk live-streamed .PERIOD so of course ,COMMA the only thing i could think of to say at that point was yeah me .PERIOD neither why did you bring this up ?QUESTIONMARK have you lost your mind ?QUESTIONMARK and i said ,COMMA i'm just thinking about it a little bit .PERIOD and my life did end when that happened .PERIOD the first is ,COMMA vulnerability is not weakness .PERIOD the majority of people i define vulnerability as emotional risk exposure .PERIOD uncertainty .PERIOD i am not a natural vulnerability researcher .PERIOD so when i became vulnerability ted ,COMMA like an action figure -- like ninja barbie .PERIOD but i'm vulnerability ted -- .PERIOD i thought i'm going to leave that shame stuff behind .PERIOD because i spent six years studying shame before i really started writing and talking about vulnerability .PERIOD but in surviving this last year ,COMMA i was reminded of a cardinal rule -- ,COMMA not a research rule ,COMMA but a moral imperative from my upbringing -- ,COMMA you've got to dance with the one who brung ya .PERIOD it is to put on some galoshes and walk through and find our way around .PERIOD here's why i can't wait to tell people this .PERIOD the credit goes to the man in the arena ,COMMA whose face is marred with dust and blood and sweat .PERIOD that's what life is about about daring greatly about being in the arena .PERIOD i know your dad never paid attention .PERIOD even when you made cfo ,COMMA shame ,COMMA drives two big tapes ,COMMA -- ,COMMA never good enough .PERIOD and if you can talk it out of that ,COMMA one ,COMMA who do you think you are ?QUESTIONMARK it's uncomfortable .PERIOD but it's adaptive .PERIOD i did not interview men for the first four years of my study .PERIOD and he said ,COMMA that's convenient .PERIOD so i started interviewing men and asking questions .PERIOD if you put shame in a petri dish ,COMMA it needs three things to grow exponentially secrecy .PERIOD silence and judgment .PERIOD if you put the same amount of shame in a petri dish and douse it with empathy ,COMMA it can't survive .PERIOD and i know it's seductive to stand outside the arena ,COMMA because i think i did it my whole life and think to myself .PERIOD i'm going to go in there and kick some ass when i'm bulletproof .PERIOD and when i'm perfect ,COMMA we want you to go in .PERIOD so what would be better [than] to use the herring gull in its freedom ,COMMA circling and swooping over the sea and [to] use this as a role model ?QUESTIONMARK so maybe we'll try it once -- to fly a smartbird .PERIOD we have to turn it .PERIOD go up and go down .PERIOD bruno giussani :COLON markus :COLON i think that we should fly it once more .PERIOD i think first it's important for us to recognize what it is to be blind today .PERIOD we're reaching not even 10 percent of them .PERIOD he had to mortgage all his life savings to make a bank loan .PERIOD it is ourselves .PERIOD we are healing .PERIOD this helped us build a very ethical ,COMMA and very highly patient-centric organization and systems that support it .PERIOD so what is in this video is a surgeon operating .PERIOD and then you see on the other side ,COMMA another patient is getting ready .PERIOD and of course ,COMMA one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away what you have as a surplus .PERIOD and what we did was a couple of very counter-intuitive things .PERIOD and then over time ,COMMA we were able to bring down the cost significantly to about two percent of what it used to be when we started out .PERIOD so we're really comparing apples to apples .PERIOD so i want to end my talk leaving this thought and challenge to you dr v when you grow in spiritual consciousness ,COMMA we identify with all that is in the world .PERIOD so there is no exploitation .PERIOD so the question is ,COMMA how do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical ?QUESTIONMARK let me show you the weight-shifting mobile .PERIOD now mass is the first thing .PERIOD the second thing that's shape again .PERIOD it's a mobile phone-shaped box .PERIOD and this one can change its shape as humans .PERIOD we are social .PERIOD we are empathic ,COMMA and that's great .PERIOD so that's very intuitive .PERIOD and that's what we want .PERIOD the brown administration ,COMMA and a bunch of my friends ,COMMA basically leveled the energy efficiency of california .PERIOD so it's the same now 30 years later ,COMMA even though our economy has gone up ,COMMA 80 percent per capita .PERIOD the dominant demographic event of our time is this screamingly ,COMMA rapid urbanization that we have going on .PERIOD it's interesting because history is driven to a large degree by the size of cities .PERIOD people are following opportunity into town .PERIOD it

,COMMA they're much more adaptable .PERIOD this is a list of them ,COMMA and as those events keep happening ,COMMA we're going to say ,COMMA okay ,COMMA what can we do about that ?QUESTIONMARK really ?QUESTIONMARK here is an example that climatologists like a lot ,COMMA one of the dozens of geoengineering ideas .PERIOD now ,COMMA this shouldn't come as a surprise to us as with bp the hole does get

parkinson's and diabetes .PERIOD we've just come out .PERIOD we're commercializing this year generation 20 of the marrow miner that was all done on a machine that looks like this .PERIOD so now ,COMMA what we do is we take a genome .PERIOD we make maybe 50 copies of it .PERIOD we cut all those copies up into little 50-base reads .PERIOD and then we sequence them massively parallel .PERIOD and he sequenced .PERIOD he took skin cells ,COMMA healthy skin and cancerous bone marrow .PERIOD and he sequenced the whole genomes of both of them in a couple of weeks ,COMMA no big deal .PERIOD and so they were given l-dopa and their symptoms did improve ,COMMA but they weren't totally asymptomatic .PERIOD and so what he did was he got his kids sequenced .PERIOD thankfully ,COMMA i was able to

be summed up in a single sentence .PERIOD everything that can happen does .PERIOD and things can happen only if these interactions are perfectly balanced .PERIOD all of these matter particles come in left- and right-handed varieties and have anti-particle partners that carry opposite charges .PERIOD these matter particles all interact with the various force particles .PERIOD the most important thing to understand here is that there's a different kind of charge associated with each of these forces ,COMMA a particle that hasn't been seen yet .PERIOD but we're pretty sure exists is the higgs particle ,COMMA which gives masses to all these other particles .PERIOD and it seems strange that nature would have so many elementary particles .PERIOD the most familiar charge is electric charge .PERIOD now it turns out the electric charge is actually a combination of two other charges ,COMMA hypercharge and weak charge .PERIOD for example ,COMMA this weak force particle and its anti-particle can be created in a collision .PERIOD one of the weak particles could decay into an electron and an anti-neutrino .PERIOD and these three still add to zero total charge .PERIOD so there's an old idea in particle physics that this known pattern of charges ,COMMA which is not very symmetric ,COMMA could emerge from a more perfect pattern that gets broken -- similar to how the higgs particle breaks ,COMMA the electroweak pattern to give electromagnetism .PERIOD this particular choice corresponds to a grand unified theory introduced by pati and salam in 1973 .PERIOD the larger pattern allows us to predict the existence of particles that have never been seen .PERIOD these particles are not uniquely identified by their six charges .PERIOD each point in this pattern corresponds to a symmetry of this very complex and beautiful shape .PERIOD and this idea that nature is described by mathematics is not at all new in 1623 .PERIOD galileo wrote this nature's grand book ,COMMA which stands continually open to our gaze is written in the language of mathematics .PERIOD and of course ,COMMA bad for me ,COMMA personally in this regard ,COMMA new physics theories are a lot like start-up

instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys -- .PERIOD and by the way ,COMMA many of the staff are now tanzanian -- .PERIOD but when we began the tacare program ,COMMA it was a tanzanian team going into the villages .PERIOD and everywhere there were these terrible problems .PERIOD and you know ,COMMA the kind i'm talking about .PERIOD i'm talking about pollution ,COMMA the water -- water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues that we're going to face in this century -- .PERIOD and everywhere water is being polluted by agricultural

exemplify and the human heart talking about it in the non-scientific term ,COMMA in terms of love ?QUESTIONMARK and compassion ,COMMA is there some disconnect ?QUESTIONMARK we have compromised their future ,COMMA hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through and can make this a better world for all living things .PERIOD one of their projects will be to help animals -- ,COMMA not just wildlife domestic animals as well .PERIOD you can't come to a conference like ted ,COMMA and not have hope can you .PERIOD and i mean ,COMMA think of the technologies ,COMMA how many of us have children or grandchildren nieces nephews people like this are so inspirational ?QUESTIONMARK and i hope that some of us can get together and talk about some of these things ,COMMA especially the roots and shoots program .PERIOD and it was very ,COMMA very exciting for me to meet her .PERIOD and see ,COMMA just one example of how young people when they are empowered given the opportunity to take action to make the world ,COMMA a better place ,COMMA truly are our hope for tomorrow ,COMMA but other than letting some of you live out your fantasy of looking as cool as tom cruise in minority report .PERIOD the reason why we're really excited about this device is that it really can act as one of these sixth-sense devices that gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of you .PERIOD you can get video annotations of the event that you're reading about .PERIOD you can get the latest sports scores ,COMMA etc .PERIOD i then in the last few years learned about the pacific garbage patch and the gyre .PERIOD and the bigger picture is we need to find a way to turn off the faucet .PERIOD it's not just that gyre of plastic that i'm concerned about -- .PERIOD it's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket .PERIOD you put something in a bin ,COMMA and you don't have to think about it again .PERIOD and i'm sure you'll feel that it's from a safe source .PERIOD but what if it wasn't the smallest bacteria is about 200 nanometers .PERIOD but i got to thinking ,COMMA you know ,COMMA if we were in the middle of a flood zone in bangladesh ,COMMA the water

.PERIOD i would like to say that i have learned so much from aicha starting with that day .PERIOD we had our very first meeting with other family members -- ,COMMA which was a very private meeting

suddenly ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA what has been the proposition of visionaries and poets down the ages becomes something we have to take seriously as a matter of public policy .PERIOD i started with a poem .PERIOD i'll end with one for john donne ,COMMA a recommendation of morality .PERIOD but if you ask ,COMMA the average american ,COMMA what the optimal formula of longevity is they

don't work ,COMMA no diet in the history of the world has ever worked for more than two percent of the population .PERIOD so when i had the chance to give the world's expert in gravity ,COMMA the

.PERIOD the women said ,COMMA we agree ,COMMA we'll use pills .PERIOD but we need a doctor to prescribe the pills .PERIOD and we had very ,COMMA very few doctors ,COMMA wherever there were people --

,COMMA they'll never get out of poverty .PERIOD and it's a center ,COMMA a focal point for economic and social development .PERIOD so we have now found the weapon of mass protection in the last 20

because without these kinds of people ,COMMA we can't have places like this .PERIOD and equally important is the negative version -- don't do to others what you would not like them to do to you .PERIOD i sometimes see ,COMMA when i'm speaking to a congregation of religious people ,COMMA a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces ,COMMA because people often want to be right instead .PERIOD and so we have a choice .PERIOD it seems to me ,COMMA and also see that it demands acute intelligence ,COMMA not just a gooey feeling in this room ,COMMA all this expertise ,COMMA if we joined it all together ,COMMA we could change the world who knew about extension managers .PERIOD now ,COMMA why would i care about rome ?QUESTIONMARK particularly these are just drawings of rome .PERIOD i get back as often as possible -- .PERIOD i need to these are sketches of some of the little details .PERIOD here's a little map .PERIOD and i thought of maps at the beginning ,COMMA maybe i should

the way .PERIOD this is something that's a little bit unusual .PERIOD this is one of those things i show to my students ,COMMA because it's a complete bastardization -- ,COMMA a denial of any rules of perspective .PERIOD i have all the pieces .PERIOD there's santa maria della pace .PERIOD there's a soccer ball .PERIOD there's a little bit of a bird's wing -- nothing's happening .PERIOD so i had to rethink it .PERIOD thank you very much .PERIOD so there's something super interesting about natural systems .PERIOD the first two are the macrobot and decibot .PERIOD one of them is the input from the user ,COMMA as you're building your bricks .PERIOD so each chain ,COMMA or each element wants to turn right or left .PERIOD you're telling each unit if it should turn right or left .PERIOD so you can basically program any three-dimensional shape -- or one-dimensional two-dimensional -- up into this chain ,COMMA completely passively at the end of the lecture .PERIOD they asked a number of questions ,COMMA but there was one that's really stuck with me since then .PERIOD and he reached the point where he felt that there must be something out there that was smaller than the smallest forms of life that were ever known -- bacteria at the time ,COMMA as we started to look at this information ,COMMA we would see that about 20 percent of the genetic information in your nose ,COMMA doesn't match anything that we've ever seen before .PERIOD -- .PERIOD no plant animal fungus virus or bacteria .PERIOD so can we have the lights off please ?QUESTIONMARK so we can see it .PERIOD well ,COMMA not quite not quite perfect -- .PERIOD you see ,COMMA in intergalactic space ,COMMA -- intergalactic space is completely dark pitch dark .PERIOD that's how big and how dark the universe is .PERIOD and that is how un-typical this place is .PERIOD now that is knowledge .PERIOD and if that weren't amazing enough ,COMMA the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles ,COMMA the other is increasing with time .PERIOD that is the growth of knowledge .PERIOD now ,COMMA how does the solar system -- and our environment in the form of us ,COMMA -- acquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA one thing that's true about stephen hawking's remark -- .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA it is true ,COMMA but it's the wrong .PERIOD emphasis one thing that's true about it is that it doesn't do it with any special physics .PERIOD there's no special dispensation ,COMMA no miracles involved .PERIOD it does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance ?QUESTIONMARK one of them is matter ,COMMA because the growth of knowledge is a form of information processing .PERIOD information processing is computation .PERIOD computation requires a computer -- .PERIOD there's no known way of making a computer without matter and the same -- .PERIOD well ,COMMA if we could do that ,COMMA we'd automatically have an energy supply ,COMMA because the transmutation would be a fusion reactor -- and evidence .PERIOD and with a more powerful telescope ,COMMA you'll be able to see stars and planets and locally there .PERIOD you could build particle accelerators and learn elementary particle physics and chemistry .PERIOD and so on .PERIOD the danger is not at all unprecedented species ,COMMA go extinct all the time .PERIOD and it's true that an ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure .PERIOD but that's only if we know what to prevent the world is buzzing at the moment with plans to force reductions in gas emissions at all costs .PERIOD they're not central to the human effort to face this problem or problems in general .PERIOD and that is ,COMMA i understand that optimists greatly outlive pessimists .PERIOD it's only 10 years ago this month ,COMMA when we published the first sequence of a free-living organism that of haemophilus influenzae .PERIOD we can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours .PERIOD and we started the sorcerer ii expedition where we were as with great oceanographic expeditions ,COMMA trying to sample the ocean every 200 miles .PERIOD and with doing this ,COMMA we've made some amazing discoveries .PERIOD i view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution .PERIOD transposons are just small pieces of dna that randomly insert in the genetic code .PERIOD we found that synthesizing accurate dna in large pieces was extremely difficult .PERIOD and there's only two countries the us and the former soviet union that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents .PERIOD i think future engineered species could be the source of food ,COMMA hopefully ,COMMA a source of energy environmental remediation .PERIOD and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry ,COMMA it was actually a very strange study ,COMMA because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books ,COMMA and they couldn't find anything in them prohibiting making life .PERIOD so it must be ,COMMA ok ,COMMA the only ultimate concerns were biological warfare aspects of this ,COMMA but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments for the reasons we were doing them .PERIOD it poses a very fascinating puzzle for us in particular check out asia .PERIOD zoom in on haiti in outline here ,COMMA but deng xiaoping ,COMMA instinctively understood the importance of offering choices to his people demonstrated successes .PERIOD there led to a consensus for a move toward the market model for the entire economy .PERIOD we can go do it over and over again .PERIOD we also need the choices for people .PERIOD the final thing we need are choices for leaders .PERIOD now ,COMMA when i say that some of you are starting to think ,COMMA well is this just bringing back colonialism .PERIOD let us have a hong kong .PERIOD nearby some of my citizens will move into that city as well .PERIOD many of them totally get the notion of a special zone that people can opt into as a rule .PERIOD so let me show you why that's wrong .PERIOD take this representation of all of the land ,COMMA their kids can get an education .PERIOD so what will it take to get started building the first charter cities scaling this ?QUESTIONMARK so we build many more .PERIOD let's have a system where we have ownership of land that is registered in a government office that people can pledge as collateral .PERIOD 15 seconds .PERIOD studio :COLON philip ,COMMA zimbardo .PERIOD let's tune into the conversation of the principals in adam's temptation come on .PERIOD adam don't be so wishy-washy .PERIOD take a bite i did .PERIOD i don't want to get in trouble .PERIOD life is temptation .PERIOD it's all about yielding resisting .PERIOD yes .PERIOD no now later ,COMMA impulsive reflective ,COMMA present ,COMMA focus and future focus .PERIOD what determines any decision you make you can focus on past-positive or past-negative and moderate on present-hedonism .PERIOD they sacrifice family time .PERIOD they sacrifice friend time .PERIOD i'm sure that resonates with some of the tedsters told me don't eat that marshmallow .PERIOD because if you wait ,COMMA you're going to get two of them until i learned to balance out ,COMMA and of all the places in the solar system that we might go to and search for answers to questions like this .PERIOD there's saturn and we have been to saturn before -- .PERIOD we visited saturn in the early 1980s -- ,COMMA but our investigations of saturn have become far more in-depth in detail since the cassini spacecraft traveling across interplanetary space for seven years ,COMMA glided into orbit around saturn in the summer of 2004 and became at that point ,COMMA the farthest robotic outpost that humanity had ever established around the sun .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA just studying the rings alone .PERIOD we stand to learn a lot about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies .PERIOD and these molecules high up in the atmosphere of titan ,COMMA get broken down and their products join together to make haze particles .PERIOD try to imagine what the surface of titan might look like it's cold .PERIOD it's eerie ,COMMA it's misty .PERIOD it might be raining .PERIOD and you might be standing on the shores of lake ,COMMA michigan brimming with paint thinner .PERIOD as i said ,COMMA it has a thick extensive atmosphere .PERIOD we have instruments on cassini which can see down to the surface through this atmosphere .PERIOD and my camera system is one of them .PERIOD they look like they've been pulled apart .PERIOD so it was -- .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA i'm getting goose bumps just talking about it .PERIOD but this is somewhat of a shoreline ,COMMA and obviously it landed in one of these flat ,COMMA dark regions .PERIOD and it didn't sink out of sight .PERIOD so it wasn't fluid that we landed in .PERIOD and it's probably the case that this material has washed off the highlands of titan .PERIOD through these channels that we saw and has drained over billions of years to fill in low-lying basins .PERIOD and i think you would agree that we have found .PERIOD titan is a remarkable mystical place .PERIOD it's exotic .PERIOD it's alien ,COMMA but yet ,COMMA strangely earth-like and having earth-like geological formations and a tremendous geographical diversity ,COMMA and is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system for complexity and richness is the earth itself .PERIOD it is a very geologically active body .PERIOD or this really ,COMMA we're having trouble feeding six billion today .PERIOD when we look at a map of los angeles or london .PERIOD it is hard to believe that as of 2005 ,COMMA only 15 percent of the world was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail at google .PERIOD 40 volunteers used a new software to map ,COMMA 120000 kilometers of roads .PERIOD 3000 hospitals ,COMMA logistics and relief points nobel

with my work across europe and the united states .PERIOD one question always comes up ,COMMA where is the palestinian gandhi ?QUESTIONMARK israeli soldier ,COMMA a nonviolent ,COMMA protest is not going to stop the [unclear] ,COMMA julia bacha .PERIOD when i first heard about the story of budrus ,COMMA i was surprised that the international media had failed to cover the extraordinary set of events that happened seven years ago in 2003 .PERIOD they had been using nonviolence for about two years ,COMMA but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention a week later .PERIOD they held the most well-attended and disciplined demonstration to date .PERIOD so the human brain has about a hundred billion neurons in it .PERIOD so beyond spatial memory ,COMMA if we look for this grid-like firing pattern throughout the whole brain ,COMMA we see it in a whole series of locations ,COMMA which are always active when we do all kinds of autobiographical .PERIOD memory tasks like remembering the last time you went to a wedding ,COMMA for example or better .PERIOD how do you explain when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions ?QUESTIONMARK why how what we say what we do ?QUESTIONMARK we say how we're different or how we're better .PERIOD and we expect some sort of a behavior .PERIOD a purchase a vote ,COMMA something like that .PERIOD all i did was reverse the order of the information in other words ,COMMA when we communicate from the outside in yes ,COMMA people can understand vast amounts of complicated information like features and benefits and facts and figures when we can communicate from the inside out .PERIOD we're talking directly to the part of the brain that controls behavior .PERIOD and then we allow people to rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do .PERIOD and samuel pierpont langley had what we assume to be the recipe for success .PERIOD the next 34 percent are your early majority ,COMMA your late majority and your laggards .PERIOD the problem is ,COMMA how do you find the ones that get it before ?QUESTIONMARK you're doing business with them versus the ones who don't get it .PERIOD people don't buy what you do .PERIOD they buy why you do it .PERIOD and what you do simply proves what you believe they were extremely well-funded in the summer of 1963 250000 people showed up on the
